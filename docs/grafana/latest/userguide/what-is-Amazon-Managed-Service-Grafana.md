# What is Amazon Managed Grafana?

Amazon Managed Grafana is a fully managed and secure data visualization service that you can use to
instantly query, correlate, and visualize operational metrics, logs, and traces from
multiple sources. Amazon Managed Grafana makes it easy to deploy, operate, and scale Grafana, a widely
deployed data visualization tool that is popular for its extensible data support.

With Amazon Managed Grafana, you create logically isolated Grafana servers called
_workspaces_. Then, you can create Grafana dashboards and
visualizations to analyze your metrics, logs, and traces without having to build, package,
or deploy any hardware to run your Grafana servers.

Amazon Managed Grafana manages the provisioning, setup, scaling, and maintenance of your logical
Grafana servers so that you don't have to do these tasks yourself. Amazon Managed Grafana also provides
built-in security features for compliance with corporate governance requirements, including
single sign-on, data access control, and audit reporting.

Amazon Managed Grafana is integrated with AWS data sources that collect operational data, such as
Amazon CloudWatch, Amazon OpenSearch Service, AWS X-Ray, AWS IoT SiteWise, Amazon Timestream, and Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus. Amazon Managed Grafana includes a
permission provisioning feature for adding supported AWS services as data sources.
Amazon Managed Grafana also supports many popular open-source, third-party, and other cloud data
sources.

For user authentication and authorization, Amazon Managed Grafana can integrate with identity providers
(IdPs) that support SAML 2.0 and also can integrate with AWS IAM Identity Center.

Amazon Managed Grafana is priced per active user in a workspace. For information about pricing, see
