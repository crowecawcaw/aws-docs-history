# Migration quick tips

This section provides migration tips that can help save time as you transition from SQL Server to Aurora MySQL. They address many of the challenges faced by administrators new to Aurora MySQL. Some of these tips describe functional differences in similar features between SQL Server and Aurora MySQL.

## Management

- The concept of a _database_ in MySQL isn’t the same as SQL Server. A database in MySQL is synonymous with _schema_. For more information, see [Databases and Schemas](chap-sql-server-aurora-mysql.tsql.md "chap-sql-server-aurora-mysql.tsql.md").
- You can’t create explicit statistics objects in Aurora MySQL. Statistics are collected and maintained for indexes only.
- The equivalent of `CREATE DATABASE…​ AS SNAPSHOT OF…​` in SQL Server resembles Amazon Aurora MySQL-Compatible Edition (Aurora MySQL) Database cloning. However, unlike SQL Server snapshots, which are read-only, Aurora MySQL cloned databases are updatable.
- In Aurora MySQL, _database snapshot_ is equivalent to `BACKUP DATABASE…​ WITH COPY_ONLY` in SQL Server.
- Partitioning in Aurora MySQL supports more partition types than SQL Server. However, be aware that partitioning in Aurora MySQL restricts the use of many other fundamental features such as foreign keys.
- Partition `SWITCH` in SQL Server can be performed between any two partitions of any two tables. In Aurora MySQL, you can only `EXCHANGE` a table partition with a full table.
- Unlike SQL Server statistics, Aurora MySQL doesn’t collect detailed key value distribution; it relies on selectivity only. When troubleshooting runtime, be aware that parameter values are insignificant to plan choices.

## SQL

- Triggers work differently in Aurora MySQL. You can run triggers for each row. The syntax for inserted and deleted for each row is `new` and `old`. They always contain 0, or 1 row.
- You can’t modify triggers in Aurora MySQL using the `ALTER` command. Drop and replace a trigger instead.
- Aurora MySQL doesn’t support `@@FETCH_STATUS` system parameter for cursors. When you declare cursors in Aurora MySQL, create an explicit `HANDLER` object, which can set a variable based on the **row not found in cursor** event. For more information, see [Stored Procedures](chap-sql-server-aurora-mysql.tsql.md "chap-sql-server-aurora-mysql.tsql.md").
- To run a stored procedure, use `CALL` instead of `EXECUTE`.
- To run a string as a query, use Aurora MySQL Prepared Statements instead of `sp_executesql` or `EXECUTE (<String>)`.
- Aurora MySQL supports `AFTER` and `BEFORE` triggers. There is no equivalent to `INSTEAD OF` triggers. The only difference between `BEFORE` and `INSTEAD OF` triggers is that DML statements are applied row by row to the base table when using `BEFORE` and doesn’t require an explicit action in the trigger. To make changes to data affected by a trigger, you can `UPDATE` the new and old tables; the changes are persisted.
- Aurora MySQL doesn’t support user defined types. Use base types instead and add column constraints as needed.
- The `CASE` keyword in Aurora MySQL isn’t only a conditional expression as in SQL Server. Depending on the context where it appears, you can use `CASE` for flow control similar to `IF <condition> BEGIN <Statement block> END ELSE BEGIN <statement block> END`.
- In Aurora MySQL, terminate `IF` blocks with `END IF`. Also, terminate `WHILE` loops with `END WHILE`. The same rule applies to `REPEAT` — `END REPEAT` and `LOOP` — `END LOOP`.
- You can’t deallocate cursors in Aurora MySQL. Closing them provides the same behavior.
- Aurora MySQL syntax for opening a transaction is `START TRANSACTION` as opposed to `BEGIN TRANSACTION`. `COMMIT` and `ROLLBACK` are used without the `TRANSACTION` keyword.
- The default isolation level in Aurora MySQL is `REPEATABLE READ` as opposed to `READ COMMITTED` in SQL Server. By default, it also uses consistent reads similar to `READ COMMITTED SNAPSHOT` in SQL Server.
- Aurora MySQL supports Boolean expressions in `SELECT` lists using the `=` operator. In SQL Server, `=` operators in select lists are used to assign aliases. `SELECT Col1 = 1 FROM T` in Aurora MySQL returns a column with the alias `Col1 = 1`, and the value 1 for the rows where `Col1 = 1`, and 0 for the rows where `Col1 <> 1 OR Col1 IS NULL`.
- Aurora MySQL doesn’t use special data types for UNICODE data. All string types may use any character set and any relevant collation including multiple types of character sets not supported by SQL Server such as UTF-8, UTF-32, and so on. A `VARCHAR` column can be of a UTF-8 character set, and have a `latin1_CI` collation for example. Similarly, there is no `N` prefix for string literals.
- You can define collations at the server, database, and column level similar to SQL Server. You can also define collations at the table level.
- In SQL Server, you can use the `DELETE <Table Name>` syntax omitting the `FROM` keyword. This syntax isn’t valid in Aurora MySQL. Add the `FROM` keyword to all delete statements.
- `UPDATE` expressions in Aurora MySQL are evaluated in order from left to right. This behavior is different from SQL Server and the ANSI standard which require an all at once evaluation. For example, in the statement `UPDATE Table SET Col1 = Col1 + 1, Col2 = Col1`, `Col2` is set to the new value of `Col1`. The end result is Col1 = Col2.
- In Aurora MySQL, you can use multiple rows with `NULL` for a UNIQUE constraint. In SQL Server, you can use only one row. Aurora MySQL follows the behavior specified in the ANSI standard.
- Although Aurora MySQL supports the syntax for `CHECK` constraints, they are parsed, but ignored.
- Aurora MySQL
  `AUTO_INCREMENT` column property is similar to `IDENTITY` in SQL Server. However, there is a major difference in the way sequences are maintained. SQL Server caches a set of values in memory and records the last allocation on disk. When the service restarts, some values may be lost, but the sequence continues from where it left off. In Aurora MySQL, each time you restart the service, the seed value to `AUTO_INCREMET` is reset to one increment interval larger than the largest existing value. Sequence position isn’t maintained across service restarts.
- Parameter names in Aurora MySQL don’t require a preceding "@". You can declare local variables such as `DECLARE MyParam1 INTEGER`.
- Parameters that use the @sign don’t have to be declared first. You can assign a value directly, which implicitly declares the parameter. For example, `SET @MyParam = 'A'`.
- The local parameter scope isn’t limited to an run scope. You can define or set a parameter in one statement, run it, and then query it in the following batch.
- Error handling in Aurora MySQL is called _condition handling_. It uses explicitly created objects, named conditions, and handlers. Instead of `THROW` and `RAISERROR`, it uses the `SIGNAL` and `RESIGNAL` statements.
- Aurora MySQL doesn’t support the `MERGE` statement. Use the `REPLACE` statement and the `INSERT…​ ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE` statement as alternatives.
- In Aurora MySQL, you can’t concatenate strings with the `+` operator. In Aurora MySQL, `'A' + 'B'` isn’t a valid expression. Use the `CONCAT` function instead. For example, `CONCAT('A', 'B')`.
- Aurora MySQL doesn’t support aliasing in the select list using the `'String Alias' = Expression`. Aurora MySQL treats it as a logical predicate, returns 0 or FALSE, and will alias the column with the full expression. Use the `AS` syntax instead. Also note that this syntax has been deprecated as of SQL Server 2008 R2.
- Aurora MySQL doesn’t support using the `DEFAULT` keyword for `INSERT` statements. Use explicit `NULL` instead. Also note that this syntax has been deprecated as of SQL Server 2008 R2.
- Aurora MySQL has a large set of string functions that is much more diverse than SQL Server. Some of the more useful string functions are:
  - `TRIM` isn’t limited to full trim or spaces. The syntax is `TRIM([{BOTH | LEADING | TRAILING} [<remove string>] FROM] <source string>))`.
  - `LENGTH` in MySQL is equivalent to `DATALENGTH` in T-SQL. `CHAR_LENGTH` is the equivalent of `LENGTH` in T-SQL.
  - `SUBSTRING_INDEX` returns a substring from a string before the specified number of occurrences of the delimiter.
  - `FIELD` returns the index position of the first argument in the subsequent arguments.
  - `FIND_IN_SET` returns the index position of the first argument within the second argument.
  - `REGEXP` and `RLIKE` provide support for regular expressions.
  - `STRCMP` provides string comparison.
  - For more information, see [String Functions and Operators](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/string-functions.html "https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/string-functions.html").

- Aurora MySQL Date and Time functions differ from SQL Server functions and can cause confusion during migration. Consider the following example:
  - `DATEADD` is supported, but is only used to add dates. Use `TIMESTAMPADD`, `DATE_ADD`, or `DATE_SUB`. There is similar behavior for `DATEDIFF`.
  - Do not use `CAST` and `CONVERT` for date formatting styles. In Aurora MySQL, use `DATE_FORMAT` and `TIME_FORMAT`.
  - If your application uses the `ANSI CURRENT_TIMESTAMP` syntax, conversion isn’t required. Use `NOW` in place of `GETDATE`.

- Object identifiers are case sensitive by default in Aurora MySQL. If you get an Object not found error, verify the object name case.
- In Aurora MySQL, you can’t declare variables interactively in a script but only within stored routines such as stored procedures, functions, and triggers.
- Aurora MySQL is much stricter than SQL Server in terms of statement terminators. Make sure that you always use a semicolons at the end of statements.
- The syntax for `CREATE PROCEDURE` requires parenthesis after the procedure name, similar to user-defined functions in SQL Server. You can’t use the `AS` keyword before the procedure body.
- Beware of control characters when copying and pasting a script to Aurora MySQL clients. Aurora MySQL is much more sensitive to these than SQL Server, and they result in frustrating syntax errors that are hard to spot.
