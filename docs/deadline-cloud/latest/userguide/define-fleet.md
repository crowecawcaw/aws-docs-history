# (Optional) Step 4: Define fleet details

A fleet allocates workers to execute your rendering tasks. If you need a fleet for
your rendering tasks, check the box for **Create fleet**.

1. **Fleet details**
   1. Provide both a **Name** and optional
      **Description** for your fleet.
   2. Review the fleet type and operating system for awareness.

2. In the **Instance market type** section, choose either
   **Spot**, **On-demand**, or
   **Wait and Save Instance**. Amazon EC2 On-demand instances
   provide faster availability and Amazon EC2 Spot and Wait and Save instances are
   better for cost saving efforts.
3. For **Auto scaling** the number of instances in your
   fleet, choose both a **Minimum** number of instances and a
   **Maximum** number of instances.

We strongly recommend to always set the minimum number of instances to
`0` to avoid incurring extra costs. 4. Review the worker capabilities for awareness. 5. (optional) Choose **Additional fleet settings**

    1. Your fleet requires permission to write to CloudWatch on your behalf. We
     recommend you create a new service role for every fleet.


    	1. For a new role, complete the following steps.


    		1. Select **Create and use a new service
    		 role**.
    		2. Enter a **Role name** for your
    		 fleet role or use the provided role name.
    		3. (Optional) Add a fleet role
    		 **Description**.
    		4. To view the IAM permissions for the fleet role,
    		 choose **View permission
    		 details**.
    	2. Alternatively, you can use an existing service
    	 role.
    2. (Optional) Add tags for the fleet using key and value
     pairs.

After you enter all the fleet details, choose **Next**.
