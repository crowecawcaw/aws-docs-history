# (Optional) Step 3: Define queue details

The queue is responsible for tracking progress and scheduling work for your
jobs.

1.  Starting in **Queue details,** provide a
    **Name** for the queue.
2.  For **Description**, enter the queue description. A clear
    description can help you quickly identify your queue's purpose.
3.  For **Job attachments**, you can either create a new Amazon S3
    bucket or choose an existing Amazon S3 bucket. If you don't have an existing Amazon S3
    bucket, you'll need to create one.
    1. To create a new Amazon S3 bucket, select **Create new job
       bucket**. You can define the name of the job bucket in
       the **Root prefix** field. We recommend calling the
       bucket
       `deadlinecloud-job-attachments-[MONITORNAME]`.

    You can only use lowercase letters and dashes. No spaces or
    special characters. 2. To search for and select an existing Amazon S3 bucket, select
    **Choose from existing Amazon S3 bucket**. Then,
    search for an existing bucket by choosing **Browse
    S3**. When the list of your available Amazon S3 buckets
    display, select the Amazon S3 bucket you want to use for your
    queue.

4.  (Optional) Choose **Additional farm settings**.

        1. If you are using customer-managed fleets, select **Enable
         association with customer-managed fleets**.


        	1. For customer-managed fleets, add a
        	 **Queue-configured user**, and then set
        	 the POSIX and/or Windows credentials. Alternatively, you can
        	 bypass the run-as functionality by selecting the
        	 checkbox.
        	2. If you want to set a budget for a queue, choose
        	 **Require a budget for this queue**. If
        	 you require a budget, you must create the budget using the
        	 Deadline Cloud console to schedule jobs in the queue.
        2. Your queue requires permission to access Amazon S3 on your behalf. We
         recommend you create a new service role for every queue.


        	1. For a new role, complete the following steps.


        		1. Select **Create and use a new service
        		 role**.
        		2. Enter a **Role name** for your
        		 queue role or use the provided role name.
        		3. (Optional) Add a queue role
        		 **Description**.
        		4. You can view the IAM permissions for the queue
        		 role by choosing **View permission
        		 details**.
        	2. Alternatively, you can select an existing service
        	 role.
        3. (Optional) Add environment variables for the queue environment
         using name and value pairs.
        4. (Optional) Add tags for the queue using key and value
         pairs.

    Choose one of the following options:

- Select **Skip to Review and Create** to [review and create your farm](review-and-create.md "review-and-create.md").
- Select **Next** to proceed to additional, optional
  steps.
