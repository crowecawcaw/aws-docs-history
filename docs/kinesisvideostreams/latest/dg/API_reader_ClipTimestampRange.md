# ClipTimestampRange

The range of timestamps for which to return fragments.

## Contents

**EndTimestamp**

The end of the timestamp range for the requested media.

This value must be within 24 hours of the specified `StartTimestamp`, and
it must be later than the `StartTimestamp` value. If
`FragmentSelectorType` for the request is `SERVER_TIMESTAMP`,
this value must be in the past.

This value is inclusive. The `EndTimestamp` is compared to the (starting)
timestamp of the fragment. Fragments that start before the `EndTimestamp`
value and continue past it are included in the session.

Type: Timestamp

Required: Yes

**StartTimestamp**

The starting timestamp in the range of timestamps for which to return fragments.

Only fragments that start exactly at or after `StartTimestamp` are included
in the session. Fragments that start before `StartTimestamp` and continue
past it aren't included in the session. If `FragmentSelectorType` is
`SERVER_TIMESTAMP`, the `StartTimestamp` must be later than
the stream head.

Type: Timestamp

Required: Yes
