# HLSTimestampRange

The start and end of the timestamp range for the requested media.

This value should not be present if `PlaybackType` is
`LIVE`.

## Contents

**EndTimestamp**

The end of the timestamp range for the requested media. This value must be within 24
hours of the specified `StartTimestamp`, and it must be later than the
`StartTimestamp` value.

If `FragmentSelectorType` for the request is `SERVER_TIMESTAMP`,
this value must be in the past.

The `EndTimestamp` value is required for `ON_DEMAND` mode, but
optional for `LIVE_REPLAY` mode. If the `EndTimestamp` is not set
for `LIVE_REPLAY` mode then the session will continue to include newly
ingested fragments until the session expires.

###### Note

This value is inclusive. The `EndTimestamp` is compared to the
(starting) timestamp of the fragment. Fragments that start before the
`EndTimestamp` value and continue past it are included in the
session.

Type: Timestamp

Required: No

**StartTimestamp**

The start of the timestamp range for the requested media.

If the `HLSTimestampRange` value is specified, the
`StartTimestamp` value is required.

Only fragments that start exactly at or after `StartTimestamp` are included
in the session. Fragments that start before `StartTimestamp` and continue
past it aren't included in the session. If `FragmentSelectorType` is
`SERVER_TIMESTAMP`, the `StartTimestamp` must be later than
the stream head.

Type: Timestamp

Required: No
