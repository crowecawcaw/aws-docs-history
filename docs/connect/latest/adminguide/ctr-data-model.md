# Data model for Amazon Connect contact records

###### Note

End of support notice: On May 20, 2026, AWS will end support for Amazon Connect
Voice ID. After May 20, 2026, you will no longer be able to access Voice ID on the
Amazon Connect console, access Voice ID features on the Amazon Connect admin website or Contact Control Panel, or access Voice ID
resources. For more information, visit [Amazon Connect
Voice ID end of support](amazonconnect-voiceid-end-of-support.md "amazonconnect-voiceid-end-of-support.md").

This article describes the data model for Amazon Connect contact records. Contact
records capture the events associated with a contact in your contact center. Real-time and
historical metrics are based on the data captured in the contact records.

## Important things to

know

- We continually release new features that result in the addition of new fields
  to the contact records data model. Any changes we make to the data model are
  backward compatible. When you develop applications, we recommend that you build
  them to ignore the addition of new fields in the contact records data model.
  This will help ensure your applications are resilient.
- Amazon Connect delivers contact records at least once. Contact records may
  be delivered again for multiple reasons, such as new information arriving after
  initial delivery. For example, when you use the [update-contact-attributes](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/connect/update-contact-attributes.html "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/connect/update-contact-attributes.html") CLI command to update a contact record,
  Amazon Connect delivers a new contact record. This contact record is
  available for 24 months from the time the associated contact was
  initiated.

If you're building a system that consumes contact record export streams, be
sure to include logic that checks for duplicate contact records for a contact.
Use the **LastUpdateTimestamp** property to determine if a copy
contains new data than previous copies. Then use the
**ContactId** property for deduplication.

- Every action taken on a unique contact generates an event. These events appear
  as a field or an attribute on the contact record. If the number of actions for a
  contact exceeds a threshold, such as an internal storage limit, then any actions
  that follow will not appear on that contact record.
- For the contact record retention period and maximum size of the attributes
  section of a contact record, see [Amazon Connect feature specifications](feature-limits.md "feature-limits.md").
- For information about when a contact record is created (and thus can be
  exported or used for data reporting), see [Events in the contact record](about-contact-states.md#ctr-events "about-contact-states.md#ctr-events").
- For a list of all contact attributes, including telephony call and case
  attributes, see [List of available contact attributes in Amazon Connect and their
  JSONPath references](connect-attrib-list.md "connect-attrib-list.md").
- In the past we referred to _contact records_ as
  _Contact Trace Records (CTR)_. Now we use the term
  _contact record_ only. There is no difference between the
  two terms.

## Agent

Information about the agent who accepted the incoming contact.

**AcceptedByAgentTimestamp**

The date and time the outbound campaigns voice contact in preview dialing
mode was accepted by the agent, in UTC time.

Type: String (yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ssZ)

**AgentInteractionDuration**

The time, in whole seconds, that an agent interacted with a customer. For
outbound calls, this is the time, in whole seconds, that an agent was
connected to a contact, even if the customer is not present.

This does not include agent pause duration (which applies only to
tasks).

Type: Integer

Min value: 0

**AgentPauseDuration**

The time, in whole seconds, that a task assigned to an agent was
paused.

Type: Integer

Min value: 0

**AfterContactWorkDuration**

The difference in time, in whole seconds, between
`AfterContactWorkStartTimestamp` and
`AfterContactWorkEndTimestamp`.

Type: Integer

Min value: 0

**AfterContactWorkEndTimestamp**

The date and time when the agent stopped doing After Contact Work for the
contact, in UTC time.

Type: String
(_yyyy_-_mm_-*dd*T*hh*:_mm_:*ss*Z)

**AfterContactWorkStartTimestamp**

The date and time when the agent started doing After Contact Work for the
contact, in UTC time.

**ConnectedToAgentTimestamp**

The date and time the contact was connected to the agent, in UTC
time.

**CustomerHoldDuration**

The time, in whole seconds, that the customer spent on hold while
connected to the agent.

Type: Integer

**AgentInitiatedHoldDuration**

The total time, in whole seconds, that a specific agent placed a customer
on hold. In multi-party scenarios, if Agent A puts a customer on hold and
then drops from the call, and Agent B later takes the customer off hold, the
remaining hold duration is attributed to Agent B.

The key distinction between CustomerHoldDuration and
AgentInitiatedHoldDuration is:

- CustomerHoldDuration tracks all hold time from a customer's
  perspective.
- AgentInitiatedHoldDuration tracks hold time initiated by specific
  agents, making it especially valuable in multi-party call
  scenarios.

For non-multiparty scenarios, CustomerHoldDuration and
AgentInitiatedHoldDuration will be the same.

contact, in UTC time. In transfer scenarios, the
DisconnectTimestamp of the previous contact indicates the
date and time when that contact ended.

Type: String
(_yyyy_-_mm_-*dd*T*hh*:_mm_:*ss*Z)

**DisconnectReason**

Indicates how the contact was terminated. This data is available in the
Amazon Connect contact record stream and **Contact
details** page.

The disconnect reason standardizes responses across different telephony
providers into unified disconnect reasons. This helps you identify issues
such as invalid numbers, call rejections, and spam blocking (both temporary
and permanent). With these definitive telephony events, you can make
data-driven decisions about how to handle call terminations.

Type: String

Voice contacts can have the following disconnect
reasons:

- `TELECOM_BUSY` – The call attempt to the third party
  returns a network busy signal. This indicates the endpoint you are
  trying to call currently cannot take a call because it is currently
  engaged.
- `TELECOM_NUMBER_INVALID` – The number you are
  attempting to call either lacks proper E164 formatting, or the
  number you are attempting to call does not exist or is no longer in
  use.
- `TELECOM_POTENTIAL_BLOCKING` – The call attempt to the
  customer receives a response from multiple networks that suggest the
  number currently faces blocking based on network level
  blocks.

###### Note

Amazon Connect helps customers flag spam blocking based on its
own best practice. Because spam blocking lacks global
unification, a very small number of false positives may occur in
this category. Amazon Connect expects to see around 1% of calls
have this effect. If blocking occurs, we recommend you review
the carrier network you are calling, and you should contact the
carrier you are attempting to call to determine why the call
faced blocking. Due to blocking rules, AWS cannot unblock
networks on your behalf.

- `TELECOM_UNANSWERED` – Amazon Connect attempts to
  deliver the call via multiple routes and currently receives messages
  from either the network or the handset confirming that the system
  cannot deliver the call at this time.
- `TELECOM_TIMEOUT` – If the call attempt occurs on
  multiple networks and reaches 60 seconds of ringing, the system
  reports that it has reached the timeout point for this call
  attempt.
- `TELECOM_ORIGINATOR_CANCEL` – This occurs when the call
  is cancelled by the originating party before the connection is
  established. For inbound calls, this happens when the customer
  cancels the call before connecting. For outbound calls, this occurs
  when the agent/API user cancels the call before connecting, or when
  the call remains unanswered after 60 seconds.
- `TELECOM_PROBLEM` – If we try to reach this customer
  via multiple networks and receive responses from the PSTN that
  indicate a problem exists with the destination network where we
  cannot reach the end network but believe the number remains valid,
  this reason code applies.

###### Note

Amazon Connect attempts to make calls as part of outbound
configuration with multiple providers as our coverage guide
shows. If the guide indicates multi-carrier setup, the result
from multiple networks shows the problem links to the
third-party network. Amazon Connect expects around 2% of calls
on average to have this effect. You do not need to report any
telecom problem to AWS Support, and this does not represent an
Amazon Connect failure.

- `CUSTOMER_NEVER_ARRIVED` – When someone creates an
  inbound web calling contact, Amazon Connect automatically terminates
  the contact if the customer doesn't connect within a specified
  period of time.
- `THIRD_PARTY_DISCONNECT` – If a call connects with the
  customer and agent engaging, this flag triggers if the remote side
  of the call initiates the disconnect.
- `CUSTOMER_DISCONNECT` – If a call connects with the
  customer and agent engaging, this flag triggers if the customer side
  of the call initiates the disconnect. This state cannot distinguish
  between poor reception and deliberate disconnection.
- `AGENT_DISCONNECT` – If a call connects with the
  customer and agent engaging, this flag triggers if the agent side of
  the call initiates the disconnect.
- `BARGED` – If a call connects with the customer and
  agent engaging but a manager disconnects the agent from the
  call.
- `CONTACT_FLOW_DISCONNECT` – Indicates the contact faced
  termination by a disconnect/hang up block within the contact
  flow.
- `OTHER` – Indicates disconnection reasons not covered
  by the above codes, such as disconnections that API calls
  initiate.

Outbound campaign voice contacts can have the following disconnect
reasons:

- `OUTBOUND_DESTINATION_ENDPOINT_ERROR`: Current
  configurations do not allow this destination to be dialed (for
  example, calling an endpoint destination from an ineligible
  instance).
- `OUTBOUND_RESOURCE_ERROR`: Instance has insufficient
  permissions to make outbound calls or necessary resources were not
  found.
- `OUTBOUND_ATTEMPT_FAILED`: There was an unknown error,
  invalid parameter, or insufficient permissions to call the
  API.
- `OUTBUND_PREVIEW_DISCARDED`: No contact made; recipient
  removed from list; no further attempts will be made.
- `EXPIRED`: Not enough agents available, or not enough
  telecom capacity for such calls.

Chats can have the following disconnect reasons:

- `AGENT_DISCONNECT`: Agent explicitly disconnects or
  rejects a chat.
- `CUSTOMER_DISCONNECT`: Customer explicitly
  disconnects.
- `AGENT_NETWORK_DISCONNECT`: Agent disconnected from the
  chat due to network issue.
- `CUSTOMER_CONNECTION_NOT_ESTABLISHED`: Customer starts
  chat but never gets connection (websocket or streaming).
- `EXPIRED`: Chat disconnected due to expiration of
  configured chat duration.
- `CONTACT_FLOW_DISCONNECT`: Chat was disconnected or
  completed by a flow.
- `API`: The StopContact API was called to end the
  chat.
- `BARGED`: Manager disconnected the agent from the
  barged-in chat.
- `IDLE_DISCONNECT`: Disconnect due to an idle
  participant.
- `THIRD_PARTY_DISCONNECT`: In chat that involves
  multiple participants, if Agent 1 disconnects Agent 2 while the
  contact is still on the chat, Agent 2's disconnect reason is
  `THIRD_PARTY_DISCONNECT`.
- `SYSTEM_ERROR`: An error in the system causing a chat
  session to end abnormally.

The disconnect reason will be recorded as 'null' for contacts that end for
reasons outside of the list above.

Tasks can have the following disconnect reasons:

- `AGENT_COMPLETED`: Agent completed the actions required
  for the task and disconnected the contact before allotted time
  expired. (Applicable for TASK contacts)
- `AGENT_DISCONNECT`: Agent marked the task as
  complete.
- `EXPIRED`: Task expired automatically because it was
  not assigned or completed within 7 days.
- `CONTACT_FLOW_DISCONNECT`: Task was disconnected or
  completed by a flow.
- `API`: The [StopContact](../APIReference/API_StopContact.md "../APIReference/API_StopContact.md") API
  was called to end the task.
- `OTHER`: This includes any reason not explicitly
  covered by the previous codes.

Emails can have the following disconnect reasons:

- `TRANSFERRED`: The email contact was transferred to
  another queue or to another agent.
- `AGENT_DISCONNECT`: An agent disconnected or closed the
  email contact without responding to it.
- `EXPIRED`: The email contact expired before it could be
  accepted or handled by an agent. This could be due to agents not
  being available, or the queue capacity was not enough to handle the
  email before is expired.
- `DISCARDED`: The outbound (agent replies or
  agent-initiated) email contact was discarded in draft state.
- `CONTACT_FLOW_DISCONNECT`: The email contact was
  disconnected in a flow.
- `API`: The [StopContact](../APIReference/API_StopContact.md "../APIReference/API_StopContact.md") API
  was called to end the email contact.
- `OTHER`: This includes any reason not explicitly
  covered by the previous reasons.

**AnsweringMachineDetectionStatus**

Indicates how an [outbound
campaign](how-to-create-campaigns.md "how-to-create-campaigns.md") call is actually disposed if the contact is connected to
Amazon Connect.

Valid values:

- `HUMAN_ANSWERED`: The number dialed was answered by a
  person.
- `VOICEMAIL_BEEP`: The number dialed was answered by
  voicemail with a beep.
- `VOICEMAIL_NO_BEEP`: The number dialed was answered by
  a voicemail with no beep.
- `AMD_UNANSWERED`: The number dialed kept ringing, but
  the call was not picked up.
- `AMD_UNRESOLVED`: The number dialed was connected but
  the answering machine detection could not determine whether the call
  was picked up by a person or voicemail.
- `AMD_UNRESOLVED_SILENCE`: The number dialed was
  connected but the answering machine detection observed
  silence.
- `AMD_NOT_APPLICABLE`: The call disconnected before
  ringing, and there was no media to detect.
- `SIT_TONE_BUSY`: The number dialed was busy
- `SIT_TONE_INVALID_NUMBER`: The number dialed was not a
  valid number.
- `SIT_TONE_DETECTED`: A special information tone (SIT)
  was detected.

  detected.
- `AMD_ERROR`: The number dialed was connected, but there
  was an error in answering machine detection.

**InitialContactId**

The identifier of the initial contact.

Type: String

Length: 1-256

**InitiationMethod**

Indicates how the contact was initiated. For more information, see [Contact initiation methods and flow types in
your Amazon Connect contact center](contact-initiation-methods.md "contact-initiation-methods.md").

Valid values:

- `INBOUND`: The customer initiated voice (phone)
  contact with your contact center.
- `OUTBOUND`: An agent initiated voice (phone) contact
  with the customer, by using the CCP to call their number.
- `TRANSFER`: The customer was transferred by an agent
  to another agent or to a queue, using quick connects in the CCP.
  This results in the creation of a new contact record.
- `CALLBACK`: The customer was contacted as part of a
  callback flow.

For more information about the InitiationMethod in this
scenario, see [Queued callbacks in real-time metrics in
Amazon Connect](about-queued-callbacks.md "about-queued-callbacks.md").

- `API`: The contact was initiated with Amazon Connect by API.
  This could be an outbound contact you created and queued to an
  agent, using the [StartOutboundVoiceContact](../APIReference/API_StartOutboundVoiceContact.md "../APIReference/API_StartOutboundVoiceContact.md") API, or it could be a
  live chat that was initiated by the customer with your contact
  center, where you called the [StartChatConnect](../APIReference/API_StartChatContact.md "../APIReference/API_StartChatContact.md") API.
- `WEBRTC_API`: The contact used the communication widget with video call.
- `QUEUE_TRANSFER`: While the customer was in one queue
  (listening to Customer queue flow), they were transferred into
  another queue using a flow block.
- `EXTERNAL_OUTBOUND`: An agent initiated voice (phone) contact with an external participant
  to your contact center using either quick connect in the CCP or a flow block.
- `MONITOR`: A supervisor initiated monitor on an agent. The supervisor can silently
  monitor the agent and customer, or barge the conversation.
- `DISCONNECT`: When a [Set disconnect flow](set-disconnect-flow.md "set-disconnect-flow.md") block is
  triggered, it specifies which flow to run after a
  disconnect event during a contact.

A disconnect event is when:

    + A chat, or task is disconnected.
    + A task is disconnected as a result of a flow action.
    + A task expires. The task is automatically disconnected when it completes its expiry timer.
     The default is 7 days and task expiry is configurable up to 90 days.

If a new contact is created while running a disconnect flow,
then the initiation method for that new contact is
DISCONNECT.

- `AGENT_REPLY`: An agent has replied to an inbound email contact to create an outbound email reply.
- `FLOW`: An email intiated by the [Send message](send-message.md "send-message.md") block.

**InitiationTimestamp**

The date and time this contact was initiated, in UTC time.

- For `INBOUND`, this is when the contact arrived.
- For `OUTBOUND`, this is when the agent began
  dialing.
- For `CALLBACK`, this is when the callback contact was
  created.
- For `EXTERNAL_OUTBOUND`, this is when the agent started
  dialing the external participant.
- For `MONITOR`, this is when the manager started
  listening to a contact.
- For `TRANSFER` and `QUEUE_TRANSFER`, this is
  when the transfer was initiated.

Type: String
(_yyyy_-_mm_-*dd*T*hh*:_mm_:*ss*Z)

In the case of tasks, InitiationTimestamp signifies when
the task contact was created, whereas EnqueueTimestamp
signifies time when the task contact was put in a queue to match the contact
with agent.

You can configure flows so there is processing done on the task before a
contact is queued. For example, this processing can take one minute or maybe
several days. Many tasks, especially those used for backoffice processing
aren't queued so they may have an InitiationTimestamp but not
an EnqueueTimestamp.

Scheduled tasks get initiated when a contact is created, however they only
start running flows when the schedule is met.

The 7 days expiry value is not absolute and there could be cases where
tasks expire just beyond 7 days ( 7.01 days )

## How to identify abandoned contacts

An abandoned contact refers to a contact that was disconnected by the customer while
in queue. This means that they weren't connected to an agent.

The contact record for an abandoned contact has a **Queue**, and an
**Enqueue Timestamp** because it was enqueued. It won't have a
**ConnectedToAgentTimestamp**, or any of the other fields that
populate only after the contact has been connected to an agent.
