# Amazon Connect bot metrics and analytics

The following flow driven metrics are available on the [Flows and conversational bot performance
dashboard](flows-performance-dashboard.md "flows-performance-dashboard.md") and the
[GetMetricDataV2](../APIReference/API_GetMetricDataV2.md "../APIReference/API_GetMetricDataV2.md").

## Average bot conversation time

This metric measures the average duration of completed conversations for which the invoking
resource (flow or flow module) started between the specified start and end time.

**Metric type**: String (_hh:mm:ss_)

**Metric category**: Flow driven metric

**How to access using the Amazon Connect API**:

- [GetMetricDataV2](../APIReference/API_GetMetricDataV2.md "../APIReference/API_GetMetricDataV2.md") API metric identifier:
  `AVG_BOT_CONVERSATION_TIME`

It can be filtered on specific conversation outcomes with
`BOT_CONVERSATION_OUTCOME_TYPE` metric level filter.

**Calculation logic**:

- Sum(Conversation Start Time - Conversation End Time of all
  filtered conversations) / (Count of all filtered conversations)

**Notes**:

- Data for this metric is available starting from December 2, 2024 00:00:00
  GMT.

## Average bot conversation turns

This metric provides the average number of turns for completed conversations for which the invoking
resource (flow or flow module) started between the specified start and end time.

A single turn is a request from the client application and a response from the
bot.

**Metric type**: Double

**Metric category**: Flow driven metric

**How to access using the Amazon Connect API**:

- [GetMetricDataV2](../APIReference/API_GetMetricDataV2.md "../APIReference/API_GetMetricDataV2.md") API metric identifier:
  `AVG_BOT_CONVERSATION_TURNS`

It can be filtered on specific conversation outcomes with
`BOT_CONVERSATION_OUTCOME_TYPE` metric level filter.

**Calculation logic**:

- Sum(Conversation Turn of all filtered conversations) /
  (Count of all filtered conversations)

**Notes**:

- Data for this metric is available starting from December 2, 2024 00:00:00
  GMT.

## Bot conversations completed

This metric provides the count of completed conversations for which the invoking resource
(flow or flow module) started between the specified start and end time. The conversation
end time can be beyond the specified end time.

For example, if you request this metric with start time at 9 AM and end time
at 10 AM, the result includes conversations where the invoking resource (flow or
flow module):

- started at 9:15 AM and ended at 9:40 AM
- started at 9:50 AM and ended at 10:10 AM

but will exclude conversations for which the invoking resource (flow or flow
module):

- started at 8:50 AM and ended at 9:10 AM

**Metric type**: Integer

**Metric category**: Flow driven metric

**How to access using the Amazon Connect API**:

- [GetMetricDataV2](../APIReference/API_GetMetricDataV2.md "../APIReference/API_GetMetricDataV2.md") API metric identifier:
  `BOT_CONVERSATIONS_COMPLETED`

It can be filtered on the following conversation outcomes using metric level
filter `BOT_CONVERSATION_OUTCOME_TYPE`.

    + SUCCESS: The final intent in the conversation is categorized as
     *success*.
    + FAILED: The final intent in the conversation is failed. The
     conversation is also failed if Amazon Lex V2 defaults to the
     `AMAZON.FallbackIntent`.
    + DROPPED: The customer does not respond before the conversation is
     categorized as *success* or
     *failed*.

**Calculation logic**:

- Total count of conversations.

**Notes**:

- Data for this metric is available starting from December 2, 2024 00:00:00
  GMT.

## Bot intents completed

This metric provides the count of completed intents. It includes intents for completed
conversations where the invoking resource (flow or flow module) started between
the specified start and end time.

**Metric type**: Integer

**Metric category**: Flow driven metric

**How to access using the Amazon Connect API**:

- [GetMetricDataV2](../APIReference/API_GetMetricDataV2.md "../APIReference/API_GetMetricDataV2.md") API metric identifier:
  `BOT_INTENTS_COMPLETED`

It can be filtered on the following conversation outcomes using metric level
filter `BOT_CONVERSATION_OUTCOME_TYPE`.

It can be filtered on the following intent outcomes using metric level filter
`BOT_INTENTS_OUTCOME_TYPE`.

    + SUCCESS: The bot successfully fulfilled the intent. One of the
     following situations is true:




    	- The intent *state* is
    	 *ReadyForFulfillment* and the type of
    	 *dialogAction* is
    	 *Close*.
    	- The intent `state` is `Fulfilled` and
    	 the type of `dialogAction` is
    	 `Close`.
    + FAILED: The bot failed to fulfill the intent. The intent state. One of
     the following situations is true:




    	- The intent `state` is `Failed` and the
    	 `type` of `dialogAction` is
    	 `Close` (for example, the user declined the
    	 confirmation prompt).
    	- The bot switches to the `AMAZON.FallbackIntent`
    	 before the intent is completed.
    + SWITCHED: The bot recognizes a different intent and switches to that
     intent instead, before the original intent is categorized as a
     *success* or *failed*.
    + DROPPED: The customer does not respond before the intent is categorized
     as *success* or *failed*.

**Calculation logic**:

- Total count of intents.

## Percent bot conversations

outcome

This metric provides the percentage of total conversations that ended in the specific outcome type
specified in the metric level filter
(`BOT_CONVERSATION_OUTCOME_TYPE`). It only includes completed
conversations for which the invoking resource (flow or flow module) started
between the specified start and end time.

**Metric type**: Percent

**Metric category**: Flow driven metric

**How to access using the Amazon Connect API**:

- [GetMetricDataV2](../APIReference/API_GetMetricDataV2.md "../APIReference/API_GetMetricDataV2.md") API metric identifier:
  `PERCENT_BOT_CONVERSATIONS_OUTCOME`

**How to access using the Amazon Connect admin website**:

**Calculation logic**:

- (Count of conversations with
  BOT_CONVERSATION_OUTCOME_TYPE)/(Total count of conversations) \* 100

**Notes**:

- Data for this metric is available starting from December 2, 2024 00:00:00

This metric provides the percentage of intents that ended in the specific outcome type specified in
the metric level filter (`BOT_INTENT_OUTCOME_TYPE`). It includes
intents in completed conversations where the invoking resource (flow or flow
module) started between the specified start and end time.

**Metric type**: Percent

**Metric category**: Flow driven metric
