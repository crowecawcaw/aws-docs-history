## Legacy permissions
<a name="legacy-permissions"></a>

The following table lists legacy permissions. You can not access these permissions through the Security Profiles page. 

 Existing security profiles that have these permissions will continue to work. However, note the following functionality: 
+  When you edit a security profile that contains legacy permissions, Connect Customer automatically migrates the legacy permissions to the new corresponding permissions when you choose **Save** on the **Security Profiles** page. 
+ You can still add legacy permissions to security profiles by using the [CreateSecurityProfile](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/APIReference/API_CreateSecurityProfile.html) and [UpdateSecurityProfile](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateSecurityProfile.html) APIs.
