# Evaluation metrics in Amazon Connect

You can view the following metrics on the [Agent performance evaluations
dashboard](agent-performance-evaluation-dashboard.md "agent-performance-evaluation-dashboard.md"). These metrics enable you
to view aggregated agent performance, and get insights across agent cohorts and over
time.

## Average evaluation score

This metric provides the average
evaluation score for all submitted evaluations.
Evaluations for calibrations are excluded from this metric.

The average evaluation score corresponds to the grouping. For example, if the grouping contains evaluation questions, then the average evaluation score is provided for the questions.
If the grouping does not contain evaluation form, section or question, then the average evaluation score is at an evaluation form level.

**Metric type**: Percent

**Metric category**: Contact evaluation driven metric

**How to access using the Amazon Connect API**:

- [GetMetricDataV2](../APIReference/API_GetMetricDataV2.md "../APIReference/API_GetMetricDataV2.md") API metric identifier:
  `AVG_EVALUATION_SCORE`

**How to access using the Amazon Connect admin website**:

- Dashboard: [Agent performance evaluations
  dashboard](agent-performance-evaluation-dashboard.md "agent-performance-evaluation-dashboard.md")

**Calculation logic**:

- Get sum of of evaluation scores: forms + sections + questions.
- Get total number of evaluations where scoring has been completed and recorded.
- Calculate average score: (sum of scores) / (total evaluations).

**Notes**:

- Excludes calibration evaluations.
- Score granularity depends on grouping level.
- Returns percentage value.
- Requires at least one filter from: queues, routing profiles, agents, or
  user hierarchy groups.
- Based on submitted evaluation timestamp.
- Data for this metric is available starting from January 10, 2025 0:00:00 GMT.

## Average weighted

evaluation score

This metric provides the average weighted evaluation score for all submitted evaluations.
Evaluations for calibrations are excluded from this metric.

The weights are per the evaluation form version that was used to perform the evaluation.

The average evaluation score corresponds to the grouping.
For example, if the grouping contains evaluation questions, then the average evaluation score is provided for the questions.
If the grouping does not contain evaluation form, section or question,
then the average evaluation score is at an evaluation form level.

**Metric type**: Percent

**Metric category**: Contact evaluation driven metric

**How to access using the Amazon Connect API**:

- [GetMetricDataV2](../APIReference/API_GetMetricDataV2.md "../APIReference/API_GetMetricDataV2.md") API metric identifier:
  `AVG_WEIGHTED_EVALUATION_SCORE`

**How to access using the Amazon Connect admin website**:

- Dashboard: [Agent performance evaluations
  dashboard](agent-performance-evaluation-dashboard.md "agent-performance-evaluation-dashboard.md")

**Calculation logic**:

- Get sum of weighted scores using form version weights.
- Get total number of evaluations where scoring has been completed and recorded.
- Calculate weighted average: (sum of weighted scores) / (total evaluations).

**Notes**:

- Uses evaluation form version-specific weights.
- Excludes calibration evaluations.
- Score granularity depends on grouping level.
- Returns percentage value.
- Requires at least one filter from: queues, routing profiles, agents, or user hierarchy groups.
- Based on submitted evaluation timestamp.
- Data for this metric is available starting from January 10, 2025 0:00:00 GMT.

## Automatic fails

percent

This metric provides the percentage of performance evaluations with automatic fails.
Evaluations for calibrations are excluded from this metric.

If a question is marked as an automatic fail, then the parent section and the form is also marked as an automatic fail.

**Metric type**: Percent

**Metric category**: Contact evaluation driven metric

**How to access using the Amazon Connect admin website**:

- Dashboard: [Agent performance evaluations
  dashboard](agent-performance-evaluation-dashboard.md "agent-performance-evaluation-dashboard.md")

**Calculation logic**:

- Get total automatic fails count.
- Get total evaluations performed.
- Calculate percentage: (automatic fails / total evaluations) \* 100.

**Notes**:

- Automatic fail cascades up (question → section → form).
- Excludes calibration evaluations.
- Returns percentage value.
- Requires at least one filter from: queues, routing profiles, agents, or
  user hierarchy groups.
- Based on submitted evaluation timestamp.
- Data for this metric is available starting from January 10, 2025 0:00:00 GMT.

## Evaluations performed

This metric provides the number
of evaluations performed with evaluation status as "Submitted."
Evaluations for calibrations are excluded from this metric.

**Metric type**: Integer

**Metric category**: Contact evaluation driven metric

**How to access using the Amazon Connect API**:

- [GetMetricDataV2](../APIReference/API_GetMetricDataV2.md "../APIReference/API_GetMetricDataV2.md") API metric identifier:
  `EVALUATIONS_PERFORMED`

**How to access using the Amazon Connect admin website**:

- Dashboard: [Agent performance evaluations
  dashboard](agent-performance-evaluation-dashboard.md "agent-performance-evaluation-dashboard.md")

**Calculation logic**:

- Check evaluationId present?
- Verify itemType is form.
- Count submitted evaluations (excluding calibrations).

**Notes**:

- Counts only submitted evaluations.
- Excludes calibration evaluations.
- Returns integer count.
- Requires at least one filter from: queues, routing profiles, agents, or user hierarchy groups.
- Based on submitted evaluation timestamp.
- Data for this metric is available starting from January 10, 2025 0:00:00 GMT.
