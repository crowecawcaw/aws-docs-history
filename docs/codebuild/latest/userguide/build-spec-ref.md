# Build specification reference for CodeBuild

This topic provides important reference information about build specification (buildspec)
files. A _buildspec_ is a collection of build commands and related settings, in YAML format, that CodeBuild uses to run a build. You can include a buildspec as part of the source code or you
can define a buildspec when you create a build project. For information about how a build
spec works, see [How CodeBuild works](concepts.md#concepts-how-it-works "concepts.md#concepts-how-it-works").

## Buildspec file name and storage

location

If you include a buildspec as part of the source code, by default, the buildspec
file must be named `buildspec.yml` and placed in the root of
your source directory.

You can override the default buildspec file name and location. For example, you
can:

- Use a different buildspec file for different builds in the same repository,
  such as `buildspec_debug.yml` and
  `buildspec_release.yml`.
- Store a buildspec file somewhere other than the root of your source
  directory, such as `config/buildspec.yml` or in an S3 bucket. The S3
  bucket must be in the same AWS Region as your build project. Specify the buildspec file using its
  ARN (for example, `arn:aws:s3:::`<my-codebuild-sample2>`/buildspec.yml`).

You can specify only one buildspec for a build project, regardless of the buildspec
file's name.

To override the default buildspec file name, location, or both, do one of the
following:

- Run the AWS CLI `create-project` or
  `update-project` command, setting the
  `buildspec` value to the path to the alternate buildspec file
  relative to the value of the built-in environment variable
  `CODEBUILD_SRC_DIR`. You can also do the equivalent with the
  `create project` operation in the AWS SDKs. For more information, see [Create a build project](create-project.md "create-project.md") or [Change build project settings](change-project.md "change-project.md").
- Run the AWS CLI `start-build` command, setting the
  `buildspecOverride` value to the path to the alternate buildspec
  file relative to the value of the built-in environment variable
  `CODEBUILD_SRC_DIR`. You can also do the equivalent with the
  `start build` operation in the AWS SDKs. For more information, see [Run builds manually](run-build.md "run-build.md").
- In an AWS CloudFormation template, set the `BuildSpec` property of
  `Source` in a resource of type
  `AWS::CodeBuild::Project` to the path to the alternate
  buildspec file relative to the value of the built-in environment variable
  `CODEBUILD_SRC_DIR`. For more information, see the BuildSpec
  property in [AWS CodeBuild
  project source](../../../AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-properties-codebuild-project-source.md "../../../AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-properties-codebuild-project-source.md") in the _AWS CloudFormation User Guide_.

## Buildspec syntax

Buildspec files must be expressed in [YAML](http://yaml.org/ "http://yaml.org/")
format.

If a command contains a character, or a string of characters, that is not supported by YAML, you must enclose the command in quotation marks (""). The
following command is enclosed in quotation marks because a colon (:) followed by a space is not allowed in YAML. The quotation mark in the command
is escaped (\").

```
"export PACKAGE_NAME=$(cat package.json | grep name | head -1 | awk -F: '{ print $2 }' | sed 's/[\",]//g')"
```

The buildspec has the following syntax:

```

```

The buildspec contains the following:

### version

Required mapping. Represents the buildspec version. We recommend that you use
`0.2`.

###### Note

Although version 0.1 is still supported, we recommend that you use version 0.2
whenever possible. For more information, see [Buildspec versions](#build-spec-ref-versions "#build-spec-ref-versions").

### run-as

Optional sequence. Available to Linux users only. Specifies a Linux user that runs
commands in this buildspec file. `run-as` grants the specified user read
and run permissions. When you specify `run-as` at the top of the
buildspec file, it applies globally to all commands. If you don't want to specify a
user for all buildspec file commands, you can specify one for commands in a phase by
using `run-as` in one of the `phases` blocks. If
`run-as` is not specified, then all commands run as the root
user.

### env

Optional sequence. Represents information for one or more custom environment
variables.

###### Note

To protect sensitive information, the following are hidden in CodeBuild logs:

- AWS access key IDs. For more information, see
  [Managing Access Keys for IAM Users](../../../IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_access-keys.md "../../../IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_access-keys.md") in the _AWS Identity and Access Management User Guide_.
- Strings specified using the Parameter Store. For more information, see [Systems Manager Parameter Store](../../../systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-paramstore.md "../../../systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-paramstore.md") and
  [Systems Manager Parameter Store Console Walkthrough](../../../systems-manager/latest/userguide/sysman-paramstore-walk.md#sysman-paramstore-console "../../../systems-manager/latest/userguide/sysman-paramstore-walk.md#sysman-paramstore-console") in the
  _Amazon EC2 Systems Manager User Guide_.
- Strings specified using AWS Secrets Manager. For more information, see
  [Key management](security-key-management.md "security-key-management.md").

env/**shell**

Optional sequence. Specifies the supported shell for Linux or Windows
operating systems.

For Linux operating systems, supported shell tags are:

- `bash`
- `/bin/sh`

For Windows operating systems, supported shell tags are:

- `powershell.exe`
- `cmd.exe`

env/**variables**

Required if `env` is specified, and you want to define
custom environment variables in plain text. Contains a mapping of
`key`/`value`
scalars, where each mapping represents a single custom environment
variable in plain text. `key` is the name of
the custom environment variable, and `value` is
that variable's value.

###### Important

We strongly discourage the storing of sensitive values in environment
variables. Environment variables can be displayed in plain text
using tools such as the CodeBuild console and the AWS CLI. For sensitive
values, we recommend that you use `parameter-store` or
`secrets-manager` mapping instead, as described later
in this section.

Any environment variables you set replace existing environment
variables. For example, if the Docker image already contains an
environment variable named `MY_VAR` with a value of
`my_value`, and you set an environment variable named
`MY_VAR` with a value of `other_value`,
then `my_value` is replaced by `other_value`.
Similarly, if the Docker image already contains an environment
variable named `PATH` with a value of
`/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin`, and you set an
environment variable named `PATH` with a value of
`$PATH:/usr/share/ant/bin`, then
`/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin` is replaced by the
literal value `$PATH:/usr/share/ant/bin`.

Do not set any environment variable with a name that starts with
`CODEBUILD_`. This prefix is reserved for internal
use.

If an environment variable with the same name is defined in
multiple places, the value is determined as follows:

- The value in the start build operation call takes highest
  precedence. You can add or override environment variables
  when you create a build. For more information, see [Run AWS CodeBuild builds manually](run-build.md "run-build.md").
- The value in the build project definition takes next
  precedence. You can add environment variables at the project
  level when you create or edit a project. For more
  information, see [Create a build project in AWS CodeBuild](create-project.md "create-project.md") and [Change build project settings in AWS CodeBuild](change-project.md "change-project.md").
- The value in the buildspec declaration takes lowest
  precedence.

env/**parameter-store**

Required if `env` is specified, and you want to retrieve
custom environment variables stored in Amazon EC2 Systems Manager Parameter Store.
Contains a mapping of
`key`/`value`
scalars, where each mapping represents a single custom environment
variable stored in Amazon EC2 Systems Manager Parameter Store.
`key` is the name you use later in your
build commands to refer to this custom environment variable, and
`value` is the name of the custom
environment variable stored in Amazon EC2 Systems Manager Parameter Store. To store
sensitive values, see [Systems Manager Parameter Store](../../../systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-paramstore.md "../../../systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-paramstore.md") and [Walkthrough: Create and test a String parameter (console)](../../../systems-manager/latest/userguide/sysman-paramstore-console.md "../../../systems-manager/latest/userguide/sysman-paramstore-console.md")
in the _Amazon EC2 Systems Manager User Guide_.

###### Important

To allow CodeBuild to retrieve custom environment variables stored in
Amazon EC2 Systems Manager Parameter Store, you must add the
`ssm:GetParameters` action to your CodeBuild service
role. For more information, see [Allow CodeBuild to interact with other AWS
services](setting-up-service-role.md "setting-up-service-role.md").

Any environment variables you retrieve from Amazon EC2 Systems Manager Parameter
Store replace existing environment variables. For example, if the
Docker image already contains an environment variable named
`MY_VAR` with a value of `my_value`, and
you retrieve an environment variable named `MY_VAR` with
a value of `other_value`, then `my_value` is
replaced by `other_value`. Similarly, if the Docker image
already contains an environment variable named `PATH`
with a value of `/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin`, and you
retrieve an environment variable named `PATH` with a
value of `$PATH:/usr/share/ant/bin`, then
`/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin` is replaced by the
literal value `$PATH:/usr/share/ant/bin`.

Do not store any environment variable with a name that starts with
`CODEBUILD_`. This prefix is reserved for internal
use.

If an environment variable with the same name is defined in
multiple places, the value is determined as follows:

- The value in the start build operation call takes highest
  precedence. You can add or override environment variables
  when you create a build. For more information, see [Run AWS CodeBuild builds manually](run-build.md "run-build.md").
- The value in the build project definition takes next
  precedence. You can add environment variables at the project
  level when you create or edit a project. For more
  information, see [Create a build project in AWS CodeBuild](create-project.md "create-project.md") and [Change build project settings in AWS CodeBuild](change-project.md "change-project.md").
- The value in the buildspec declaration takes lowest
  precedence.

env/**secrets-manager**

Required if you want to retrieve custom environment variables stored in AWS Secrets Manager.
Specify a Secrets Manager `reference-key` using the following
pattern:

`<key>`:
``<secret-id>`:`<json-key>`:`<version-stage>`:`<version-id>``

`<key>`

(Required) The local environment variable name. Use this name to
access the variable during the build.

`<secret-id>`

(Required) The name or Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that serves as a
unique identifier for the secret. To access a secret in your AWS
account, simply specify the secret name. To access a secret in a
different AWS account, specify the secret ARN.

`<json-key>`

(Optional) Specifies the key name of the Secrets Manager key-value pair
whose value you want to retrieve. If you do not specify a
`json-key`, CodeBuild retrieves the entire secret text.

`<version-stage>`

(Optional) Specifies the secret version that you want to retrieve
by the staging label attached to the version. Staging labels are
used to keep track of different versions during the rotation
process. If you use `version-stage`, don't specify
`version-id`. If you don't specify a version stage or
version ID, the default is to retrieve the version with the version
stage value of `AWSCURRENT`.

`<version-id>`

(Optional) Specifies the unique identifier of the version of the
secret that you want to use. If you specify `version-id`,
don't specify `version-stage`. If you don't specify a
version stage or version ID, the default is to retrieve the version
with the version stage value of `AWSCURRENT`.

In the following example, `TestSecret` is the name of the key-value
pair stored in Secrets Manager. The key for `TestSecret` is
`MY_SECRET_VAR`. You access the variable during the build using
the `LOCAL_SECRET_VAR` name.

```
env:
  secrets-manager:
    LOCAL_SECRET_VAR: "TestSecret:MY_SECRET_VAR"
```

For more information, see [What is AWS Secrets Manager](../../../secretsmanager/latest/userguide/intro.md "../../../secretsmanager/latest/userguide/intro.md")
in the _AWS Secrets Manager User Guide_.

env/**exported-variables**

Optional mapping. Used to list environment variables you want to
export. Specify the name of each variable you want to export on a
separate line under `exported-variables`. The variable you
want to export must be available in your container during the build. The
variable you export can be an environment variable.

Exported environment variables are used in conjunction with AWS CodePipeline to export
environment variables from the current build stage to subsequent stages in the pipeline.
For more information, see [Working with variables](../../../codepipeline/latest/userguide/actions-variables.md "../../../codepipeline/latest/userguide/actions-variables.md") in the _AWS CodePipeline User Guide_.

During a build, the value of a variable is available starting with the
`install` phase. It can be updated between the start of the
`install` phase and the end of the `post_build` phase.
After the `post_build` phase ends, the value of exported variables
cannot change.

###### Note

The following cannot be exported:

- Amazon EC2 Systems Manager Parameter Store secrets specified in the build
  project.
- Secrets Manager secrets specified in the build project
- Environment variables that start with `AWS_`.

env/**git-credential-helper**

Optional mapping. Used to indicate if CodeBuild uses its Git credential
helper to provide Git credentials. `yes` if it is used.
Otherwise, `no` or not specified. For more information, see
[gitcredentials](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitcredentials "https://git-scm.com/docs/gitcredentials") on the Git website.

###### Note

`git-credential-helper` is not supported for builds that
are triggered by a webhook for a public Git repository.

### proxy

Optional sequence. Used to represent settings if you run your build in an explicit
proxy server. For more information, see [Run CodeBuild in an explicit proxy
server](run-codebuild-in-explicit-proxy-server.md "run-codebuild-in-explicit-proxy-server.md").

proxy/**upload-artifacts**

Optional mapping. Set to `yes` if you want your build in an
explicit proxy server to upload artifacts. The default is
`no`.

proxy/**logs**

Optional mapping. Set to `yes` for your build in a explicit
proxy server to create CloudWatch logs. The default is `no`.

### phases

Required sequence. Represents the commands CodeBuild runs during each phase of the
build.

###### Note

In buildspec version 0.1, CodeBuild runs each command in a separate instance of
the default shell in the build environment. This means that each command runs in
isolation from all other commands. Therefore, by default, you cannot run a
single command that relies on the state of any previous commands (for example,
changing directories or setting environment variables). To get around this
limitation, we recommend that you use version 0.2, which solves this issue. If
you must use buildspec version 0.1, we recommend the approaches in [Shells and commands in build environments](build-env-ref-cmd.md "build-env-ref-cmd.md").

phases/\*/**run-as**

Optional sequence. Use in a build phase to specify a Linux user that
runs its commands. If `run-as` is also specified globally for
all commands at the top of the buildspec file, then the phase-level user
takes precedence. For example, if globally `run-as` specifies
User-1, and for the `install` phase only a
`run-as` statement specifies User-2, then all commands in
then buildspec file are run as User-1 _except_ commands in the `install` phase, which
are run as User-2.

phases/\*/**on-failure**

Optional sequence. Specifies the action to take if a failure occurs during the
phase. This can be one of the following values:

- `ABORT` - Abort the build.
- `CONTINUE` - Continue to the next phase.
- `RETRY` - Retry the build up to 3 times with an error message that matches the regular expression `.*`.
- `RETRY-`count``- Retry the build for a specified number of times, as 
represented by`count`with an error message that matches the regular expression`.\*`. 
Note that `count`must be between 0 and 100. For example, valid values include`RETRY-4`and`RETRY-8`.
- `RETRY-`regex``- Retry the build up to 3 times, and use`regex`
to include a regular expression to match a specifed error message. For example, valid values include`Retry-._Error: Unable to connect to database._`and`RETRY-invalid+`.
- `RETRY-`count`-`regex``- Retry the build for a specified number of times, as 
represented by`count`. Note that `count`must be between 0 and 100. You can also use`regex`
to include a regular expression to match the error message. For example, valid values include`Retry-3-._connection timed out._`and`RETRY-8-invalid+`.

If this property is not specified, the failure process follows the transition
phases as shown in [Build phase transitions](view-build-details-phases.md "view-build-details-phases.md").

###### Important

The `on-failure` attribute is not supported when using Lambda compute or reserved capacity. This attribute only works with EC2 compute images provided by CodeBuild.

phases/\*/**finally**

Optional block. Commands specified in a
`finally` block are run after commands in the
`commands` block. The commands in a `finally` block
are run even if a command in the `commands` block fails. For
example, if the `commands` block contains three commands and the
first fails, CodeBuild skips the remaining two commands and runs any commands in the
`finally` block. The phase is successful when all commands in the
`commands` and the `finally` blocks run successfully.
If any command in a phase fails, the phase fails.

The allowed build phase names are:

phases/**install**

Optional sequence. Represents the commands, if any, that CodeBuild runs
during installation. We recommend that you use the `install`
phase only for installing packages in the build environment. For
example, you might use this phase to install a code testing framework
such as Mocha or RSpec.

phases/install/**runtime-versions**

Optional sequence. A
runtime version is supported with the Ubuntu standard image
5.0 or later and the Amazon Linux 2 standard image 4.0 or later. If
specified, at least one runtime must be included in this
section. Specify a runtime using a specific version, a major
version followed by `.x` to specify that CodeBuild
uses that major version with its latest minor version, or
`latest` to use the most recent major and
minor version (for example, `ruby: 3.2`,
`nodejs: 18.x`, or
`java: latest`). You can specify the runtime
using a number or an environment variable. For example, if
you use the Amazon Linux 2 standard image 4.0, then the following
specifies that version 17 of Java, the latest minor version
of python version 3, and a version contained in an
environment variable of Ruby is installed. For more
information, see [Docker images provided by CodeBuild](build-env-ref-available.md "build-env-ref-available.md").

```
phases:
  install:
    runtime-versions:
      java: corretto8
      python: 3.x
      ruby: "$MY_RUBY_VAR"
```

You can specify one or more runtimes in the `runtime-versions` section of your buildspec file. If your runtime
is dependent upon another runtime, you can also specify its dependent runtime in the buildspec file.
If you do not specify any runtimes in the buildspec file, CodeBuild chooses the default runtimes that
are available in the image you use. If you specify one or more runtimes, CodeBuild uses only those runtimes.
If a dependent runtime is not specified, CodeBuild attempts to choose the dependent runtime for you.

If two specified runtimes conflict, the build fails. For
example, `android: 29` and `java:
 openjdk11` conflict, so if both are specified, the
build fails.

For more information about the available runtimes, see [Available runtimes](available-runtimes.md "available-runtimes.md").

###### Note

If you specify a `runtime-versions` section and use an image other than Ubuntu Standard Image 2.0 or later,
or the Amazon Linux 2 (AL2) standard image 1.0 or later, the build issues the warning,
"`Skipping install of runtimes. Runtime version selection is not supported by this build image`."

phases/install/**commands**

Optional sequence. Contains a sequence of scalars, where each scalar represents
a single command that CodeBuild runs during installation. CodeBuild runs
each command, one at a time, in the order listed, from beginning to
end.

phases/**pre_build**

Optional sequence. Represents the commands, if any, that CodeBuild runs
before the build. For example, you might use this phase to sign in to
Amazon ECR, or you might install npm dependencies.

phases/pre_build/**commands**

Required sequence if `pre_build` is specified.
Contains a sequence of scalars, where each scalar represents
a single command that CodeBuild runs before the build. CodeBuild
runs each command, one at a time, in the order listed, from
beginning to end.

phases/**build**

Optional sequence. Represents the commands, if any, that CodeBuild runs
during the build. For example, you might use this phase to run Mocha,
RSpec, or sbt.

phases/build/**commands**

Required if `build` is specified. Contains a sequence of scalars,
where each scalar represents a single command that CodeBuild runs during
the build. CodeBuild runs each command, one at a time, in the order
listed, from beginning to end.

phases/**post_build**

Optional sequence. Represents the commands, if any, that CodeBuild runs
after the build. For example, you might use Maven to package the build
artifacts into a JAR or WAR file, or you might push a Docker image into
Amazon ECR. Then you might send a build notification through Amazon SNS.

phases/post_build/**commands**

Required if `post_build` is specified. Contains a sequence of
scalars, where each scalar represents a single command that CodeBuild
runs after the build. CodeBuild runs each command, one at a time, in the
order listed, from beginning to end.

### reports

**report-group-name-or-arn**

Optional sequence. Specifies the report group that the reports are sent to. A project
can have a maximum of five report groups. Specify the ARN of an existing report
group, or the name of a new report group. If you specify a name, CodeBuild creates a
report group using your project name and the name you specify in the format
`<project-name>-<report-group-name>`. The report group name can also be set
using an environment variable in the buildspec such as `$REPORT_GROUP_NAME`. For more information,
see [Report group naming](test-report-group-naming.md "test-report-group-naming.md").

reports/<report-group>/**files**

Required sequence. Represents the locations that contain the raw data
of test results generated by the report. Contains a sequence of scalars,
with each scalar representing a separate location where CodeBuild can find
test files, relative to the original build location or, if set, the
`base-directory`. Locations can include the
following:

- A single file (for example,
  `my-test-report-file.json`).
- A single file in a subdirectory (for example,
  ``my-subdirectory`/my-test-report-file.json`
or
``my-parent-subdirectory`/`my-subdirectory`/my-test-report-file.json`).
- `'**/*'` represents all files
  recursively.
- ``my-subdirectory`/\*`represents all files in a subdirectory named`my-subdirectory`.
- ``my-subdirectory`/\*_/_`represents all files recursively starting from a subdirectory
named`my-subdirectory`.

reports/<report-group>/**file-format**

Optional mapping. Represents the report file format. If not specified,
`JUNITXML` is used. This value is not case sensitive. Possible
values are:

###### Test reports

`CUCUMBERJSON`

Cucumber JSON

`JUNITXML`

JUnit XML

`NUNITXML`

NUnit XML

`NUNIT3XML`

NUnit 3 XML

`TESTNGXML`

TestNG XML

`VISUALSTUDIOTRX`

Visual Studio TRX

###### Code coverage reports

`CLOVERXML`

Clover XML

`COBERTURAXML`

Cobertura XML

`JACOCOXML`

JaCoCo XML

`SIMPLECOV`

SimpleCov JSON

###### Note

CodeBuild accepts JSON code coverage reports generated by [simplecov](https://github.com/simplecov-ruby/simplecov "https://github.com/simplecov-ruby/simplecov"), not [simplecov-json](https://github.com/vicentllongo/simplecov-json "https://github.com/vicentllongo/simplecov-json").

reports/<report-group>/**base-directory**

Optional mapping. Represents one or more top-level directories,
relative to the original build location, that CodeBuild uses to determine
where to find the raw test files.

reports/<report-group>/**discard-paths**

Optional. Specifies if the report file directories are flattened in the
output. If this is not specified, or contains `no`, report files are
output with their directory structure intact. If this contains `yes`,
all of the test files are placed in the same output directory. For example, if a
path to a test result is `com/myapp/mytests/TestResult.xml`,
specifying `yes` will place this file in
`/TestResult.xml`.

### artifacts

Optional sequence. Represents information about where CodeBuild can find the build
output and how CodeBuild prepares it for uploading to the S3 output bucket. This
sequence is not required if, for example, you are building and pushing a Docker
image to Amazon ECR, or you are running unit tests on your source code, but not building
it.

###### Note

Amazon S3 metadata has a CodeBuild header named `x-amz-meta-codebuild-buildarn` which
contains the `buildArn` of the CodeBuild build that publishes artifacts to Amazon S3.
The `buildArn` is added to allow source tracking for notifications and to
reference which build the artifact is generated from.

artifacts/**files**

Required sequence. Represents the locations that contain the build
output artifacts in the build environment. Contains a sequence of
scalars, with each scalar representing a separate location where CodeBuild
can find build output artifacts, relative to the original build location
or, if set, the base directory. Locations can include the
following:

- A single file (for example,
  `my-file.jar`).
- A single file in a subdirectory (for example,
  ``my-subdirectory`/my-file.jar`
or
``my-parent-subdirectory`/`my-subdirectory`/my-file.jar`).
- `'**/*'` represents all files
  recursively.
- ``my-subdirectory`/\*`represents all files in a subdirectory named`my-subdirectory`.
- ``my-subdirectory`/\*_/_`represents all files recursively starting from a subdirectory
named`my-subdirectory`.

When you specify build output artifact locations, CodeBuild can locate the
original build location in the build environment. You do not have to
prepend your build artifact output locations with the path to the
original build location or specify `./` or similar. If you
want to know the path to this location, you can run a command such as
`echo $CODEBUILD_SRC_DIR` during a build. The location
for each build environment might be slightly different.

artifacts/**name**

Optional name. Specifies a name for your build artifact. This name is
used when one of the following is true.

- You use the CodeBuild API to create your builds and the
  `overrideArtifactName` flag is set on the
  `ProjectArtifacts` object when a project is updated, a
  project is created, or a build is started.
- You use the CodeBuild console to create your builds, a name is specified
  in the buildspec file, and you select **Enable semantic
  versioning** when you create or update a project. For more
  information, see [Create a build project (console)](create-project.md#create-project-console "create-project.md#create-project-console").

You can specify a name in the buildspec file that is calculated at
build time. The name specified in a buildspec file uses the Shell
command language. For example, you can append a date and time to your
artifact name so that it is always unique. Unique artifact names prevent
artifacts from being overwritten. For more information, see [Shell command
language](http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/ "http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/").

- This is an example of an artifact name appended with the date the
  artifact is created.

```
version: 0.2
phases:
  build:
    commands:
      - rspec HelloWorld_spec.rb
artifacts:
  files:
    - '**/*'
  name: myname-$(date +%Y-%m-%d)
```

- This is an example of an artifact name that uses a CodeBuild environment
  variable. For more information, see [Environment variables in build
  environments](build-env-ref-env-vars.md "build-env-ref-env-vars.md").

```
version: 0.2
phases:
  build:
    commands:
      - rspec HelloWorld_spec.rb
artifacts:
  files:
    - '**/*'
  name: myname-$AWS_REGION
```

- This is an example of an artifact name that uses a CodeBuild environment
  variable with the artifact's creation date appended to it.

```
version: 0.2
phases:
  build:
    commands:
      - rspec HelloWorld_spec.rb
artifacts:
  files:
    - '**/*'
  name: $AWS_REGION-$(date +%Y-%m-%d)
```

You can add path information to the name so that the named artifacts are
placed in directories based on the path in the name. In this example, build
artifacts are placed in the output under `builds/<build
 number>/my-artifacts`.

```
version: 0.2
phases:
  build:
    commands:
      - rspec HelloWorld_spec.rb
artifacts:
  files:
    - '**/*'
  name: builds/$CODEBUILD_BUILD_NUMBER/my-artifacts
```

artifacts/**discard-paths**

Optional. Specifies if the build artifact directories are flattened in the
output. If this is not specified, or contains `no`, build artifacts
are output with their directory structure intact. If this contains
`yes`, all of the build artifacts are placed in the same output
directory. For example, if a path to a file in the build output artifact is
`com/mycompany/app/HelloWorld.java`, specifying
`yes` will place this file in
`/HelloWorld.java`.

artifacts/**base-directory**

Optional mapping. Represents one or more top-level directories,
relative to the original build location, that CodeBuild uses to determine
which files and subdirectories to include in the build output artifact.
Valid values include:

- A single top-level directory (for example,
  `my-directory`).
- `'my-directory*'` represents all top-level
  directories with names starting with
  `my-directory`.

Matching top-level directories are not included in the build output
artifact, only their files and subdirectories.

You can use `files` and `discard-paths` to
further restrict which files and subdirectories are included. For
example, for the following directory structure:

```
.
├── my-build-1
│   └── my-file-1.txt
└── my-build-2
    ├── my-file-2.txt
    └── my-subdirectory
        └── my-file-3.txt
```

And for the following `artifacts` sequence:

```
artifacts:
  files:
    - '*/my-file-3.txt'
  base-directory: my-build-2
```

The following subdirectory and file would be included in the build
output artifact:

```
.
└── my-subdirectory
    └── my-file-3.txt
```

While for the following `artifacts` sequence:

```
artifacts:
  files:
    - '**/*'
  base-directory: 'my-build*'
  discard-paths: yes
```

The following files would be included in the build output
artifact:

```
.
├── my-file-1.txt
├── my-file-2.txt
└── my-file-3.txt
```

artifacts/**exclude-paths**

Optional mapping. Represents one or more paths, relative to
`base-directory`, that CodeBuild will exclude from the build
artifacts. The asterisk (`*`) character matches zero or more characters of a name component
without crossing folder boundaries. A double asterisk (`**`) matches zero or more
characters of a name component across all directories.

Examples of exclude-paths
include the following:

- To exclude a file from all directories:
  `"**/`file-name`/**/*"`
- To exclude all dot folders:
  `"**/.*/**/*"`
- To exclude all dot files:
  `"**/.*"`

artifacts/**enable-symlinks**

Optional. If the output type is `ZIP`, specifies if internal
symbolic links are preserved in the ZIP file. If this contains `yes`,
all internal symbolic links in the source will be preserved in the artifacts ZIP
file.

artifacts/**s3-prefix**

Optional. Specifies a prefix used when the artifacts are output to an Amazon S3
bucket and the namespace type is `BUILD_ID`. When used, the output
path in the bucket is
`<s3-prefix>/<build-id>/<name>.zip`.

artifacts/**secondary-artifacts**

Optional sequence. Represents one or more artifact definitions as a mapping
between an artifact identifier and an artifact definition. Each artifact
identifiers in this block must match an artifact defined in the
`secondaryArtifacts` attribute of your project. Each separate
definition has the same syntax as the `artifacts` block above.

###### Note

The [artifacts/files](#build-spec.artifacts.files "#build-spec.artifacts.files") sequence is always required,
even when there are only secondary artifacts defined.

For example, if your project has the following structure:

```
{
  "name": "sample-project",
  "secondaryArtifacts": [
    {
      "type": "S3",
      "location": "`<output-bucket1>`",
      "artifactIdentifier": "artifact1",
      "name": "secondary-artifact-name-1"
    },
    {
      "type": "S3",
      "location": "`<output-bucket2>`",
      "artifactIdentifier": "artifact2",
      "name": "secondary-artifact-name-2"
    }
  ]
}
```

Then your buildspec looks like the following:

```
version: 0.2

phases:
build:
  commands:
    - echo Building...
artifacts:
  files:
    - '**/*'
  secondary-artifacts:
    artifact1:
      files:
        - directory/file1
      name: secondary-artifact-name-1
    artifact2:
      files:
        - directory/file2
      name: secondary-artifact-name-2
```

### cache

Optional sequence. Represents information about where CodeBuild can prepare the files
for uploading cache to an S3 cache bucket. This sequence is not required if the
cache type of the project is `No Cache`.

cache/**key**

Optional sequence. Represents the primary key used when search or restore
a cache. CodeBuild does an exact match for the primary key.

Here is an example for the key:

```
key: npm-key-$(codebuild-hash-files package-lock.json) }
```

cache/**fallback-keys**

Optional sequence. Represents a list of fallback keys used sequentially when a cache
cannot be found using the primary key. Up to five fallback keys are supported, and each
is matched using a prefix search. This sequence will be ignored if
**key** is not provided.

Here is an example for the fallback-keys:

```
fallback-keys:
    - npm-key-$(codebuild-hash-files package-lock.json) }
    - npm-key-
    - npm-
```

cache/**action**

Optional sequence. Specifies the action to perform on the cache. Valid values include:

- `restore` which only restores the cache without saving updates.
- `save` which only saves the cache without restoring a previous version.

If no value is provided, CodeBuild defaults to performing both restore and save.

cache/**paths**

Required sequence. Represents the locations of the cache. Contains a
sequence of scalars, with each scalar representing a separate location
where CodeBuild can find build output artifacts, relative to the original
build location or, if set, the base directory. Locations can include the
following:

- A single file (for example,
  `my-file.jar`).
- A single file in a subdirectory (for example,
  ``my-subdirectory`/my-file.jar`
or
``my-parent-subdirectory`/`my-subdirectory`/my-file.jar`).
- `'**/*'` represents all files
  recursively.
- ``my-subdirectory`/\*`represents all files in a subdirectory named`my-subdirectory`.
- ``my-subdirectory`/\*_/_`represents all files recursively starting from a subdirectory
named`my-subdirectory`.

###### Important

Because a buildspec declaration must be valid YAML, the spacing in a buildspec
declaration is important. If the number of spaces in your buildspec declaration is
invalid, builds might fail immediately. You can use a YAML validator to test whether
your buildspec declarations are valid YAML.

If you use the AWS CLI, or the AWS SDKs to declare a buildspec when you create or
update a build project, the buildspec must be a single string expressed in YAML
format, along with required whitespace and newline escape characters. There is an
example in the next section.

If you use the CodeBuild or AWS CodePipeline consoles instead of a buildspec.yml file, you
can insert commands for the `build` phase only. Instead of using the
preceding syntax, you list, in a single line, all of the commands that you want to
run during the build phase. For multiple commands, separate each command by
`&&` (for example, `mvn test && mvn
 package`).

You can use the CodeBuild or CodePipeline consoles instead of a buildspec.yml file to specify
the locations of the build output artifacts in the build environment. Instead of
using the preceding syntax, you list, in a single line, all of the locations. For
multiple locations, separate each location with a comma (for example,
`buildspec.yml, target/my-app.jar`).

## Buildspec example

Here is an example of a buildspec.yml file.

```

```

Here is an example of the preceding buildspec, expressed as a single string, for use
with the AWS CLI, or the AWS SDKs.

```
"version: 0.2\n\nenv:\n  variables:\n    JAVA_HOME: \"/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64\\"\n  parameter-store:\n    LOGIN_PASSWORD: /CodeBuild/dockerLoginPassword\n  phases:\n\n  install:\n    commands:\n      - echo Entered the install phase...\n      - apt-get update -y\n      - apt-get install -y maven\n    finally:\n      - echo This always runs even if the update or install command fails \n  pre_build:\n    commands:\n      - echo Entered the pre_build phase...\n      - docker login -u User -p $LOGIN_PASSWORD\n    finally:\n      - echo This always runs even if the login command fails \n  build:\n    commands:\n      - echo Entered the build phase...\n      - echo Build started on `date`\n      - mvn install\n    finally:\n      - echo This always runs even if the install command fails\n  post_build:\n    commands:\n      - echo Entered the post_build phase...\n      - echo Build completed on `date`\n\n reports:\n  reportGroupJunitXml:\n    files:\n      - \"**/*\"\n    base-directory: 'target/tests/reports'\n    discard-paths: false\n  reportGroupCucumberJson:\n    files:\n      - 'cucumber/target/cucumber-tests.xml'\n    file-format: CUCUMBERJSON\n\nartifacts:\n  files:\n    - target/messageUtil-1.0.jar\n  discard-paths: yes\n  secondary-artifacts:\n    artifact1:\n      files:\n       - target/messageUtil-1.0.jar\n      discard-paths: yes\n    artifact2:\n      files:\n       - target/messageUtil-1.0.jar\n      discard-paths: yes\n cache:\n  paths:\n    - '/root/.m2/**/*'"
```

Here is an example of the commands in the `build` phase, for use with the
CodeBuild or CodePipeline consoles.

```
echo Build started on `date` && mvn install
```

In these examples:

- A custom environment variable, in plain text, with the key of
  `JAVA_HOME` and the value of
  `/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64`, is set.
- A custom environment variable named `dockerLoginPassword` you
  stored in Amazon EC2 Systems Manager Parameter Store is referenced later in build commands by
  using the key `LOGIN_PASSWORD`.
- You cannot change these build phase names. The commands that are run in this
  example are `apt-get update -y` and `apt-get install -y
maven` (to install Apache Maven), `mvn install` (to
  compile, test, and package the source code into a build output artifact and to
  install the build output artifact in its internal repository), `docker
login` (to sign in to Docker with the password that corresponds to the
  value of the custom environment variable `dockerLoginPassword` you
  set in Amazon EC2 Systems Manager Parameter Store), and several `echo` commands. The
  `echo` commands are included here to show how CodeBuild runs commands
  and the order in which it runs them.
- `files` represents the files to upload to the build output
  location. In this example, CodeBuild uploads the single file
  `messageUtil-1.0.jar`. The
  `messageUtil-1.0.jar` file can be found in the relative
  directory named `target` in the build environment. Because
  `discard-paths: yes` is specified,
  `messageUtil-1.0.jar` is uploaded directly (and not to an
  intermediate `target` directory). The file name
  `messageUtil-1.0.jar` and the relative directory name of
  `target` is based on the way Apache Maven creates and
  stores build output artifacts for this example only. In your own scenarios,
  these file names and directories will be different.
- `reports` represents two
  report groups that generate reports
  during the build:
  - `arn:aws:codebuild:your-region:your-aws-account-id:report-group/report-group-name-1`
    specifies the ARN of a report group.
    Test
    results generated by the test framework are in the
    `target/tests/reports` directory. The file format
    is `JunitXml`
    and
    the path is not removed from the files that contain
    test results.
  - `reportGroupCucumberJson` specifies a new report group. If
    the name of the project is `my-project`, a report
    group with the name
    `my-project-reportGroupCucumberJson` is created
    when a build is run. Test results generated by the test framework are in
    `cucumber/target/cucumber-tests.xml`. The test
    file format is `CucumberJson` and the path is removed from
    the files that contain test results.

## Buildspec versions

The following table lists the buildspec versions and the changes between
versions.
