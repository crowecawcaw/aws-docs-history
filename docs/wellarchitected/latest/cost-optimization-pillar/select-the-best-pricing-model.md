# Select the best pricing model

**Perform workload cost modeling:**
Consider the requirements of the workload components and
understand the potential pricing models. Define the availability
requirement of the component. Determine if there are multiple
independent resources that perform the function in the workload,
and what the workload requirements are over time. Compare the cost
of the resources using the default On-Demand pricing model and
other applicable models. Factor in any potential changes in
resources or workload components.

**Perform regular account level analysis:** Performing regular
cost modeling ensures that opportunities to optimize across multiple workloads can be
implemented. For example, if multiple workloads use On-Demand, at an aggregate level, the risk
of change is lower, and implementing a commitment-based discount will achieve a lower overall
cost. It is recommended to perform analysis in regular cycles of two weeks to one month. This
analysis allows you to make small adjustment purchases, so the coverage of your pricing
models continues to evolve with your changing workloads and their components.

Use the [AWS Cost Explorer](https://aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/aws-cost-explorer/ "https://aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/aws-cost-explorer/") recommendations tool to find opportunities for commitment discounts.

To find opportunities for Spot workloads, use an hourly view of your overall usage, and
look for regular periods of changing usage or elasticity.

**Pricing models:** AWS has
multiple
[pricing
models](https://aws.amazon.com/pricing/ "https://aws.amazon.com/pricing/") that allow you to pay for your resources in the most
cost-effective way that suits your organization’s needs. The
following section describes each purchasing model:

- On-Demand Instances
- Spot Instances
- Commitment discounts - Savings Plans
- Commitment discounts - Reserved Instances/Capacity
- Geographic selection
- Third-party agreements and pricing

**On-Demand Instances:** This is the default, pay as you go pricing model.
When you use resources (for example, EC2 instances or services such as DynamoDB on demand) you
pay a flat rate, and you have no long-term commitments. You can increase or decrease the
capacity of your resources or services based on the demands of your application. On-Demand has
an hourly rate, but depending on the service, can be billed in increments of one second (for
example Amazon RDS, or Linux EC2 instances). On demand is recommended for applications with
short-term workloads (for example, a four-month project), that spike periodically, or
unpredictable workloads that can’t be interrupted. On demand is also suitable for workloads,
such as pre-production environments, which require uninterrupted runtimes, but do not run long
enough for a commitment discount (Savings Plans or Reserved Instances).

**Spot Instances:** A
[Spot
Instance](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/spot/ "https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/spot/") is spare Amazon EC2 compute capacity available at
discounts of up to 90% off On-Demand prices with no long-term
commitment required. With Spot Instances, you can significantly
reduce the cost of running your applications or scale your
application’s compute capacity for the same budget. Unlike
On-Demand, Spot Instances can be interrupted with a 2-minute
warning if Amazon EC2 needs the capacity back, or the Spot Instance price
exceeds your configured price. On average, Spot Instances are
interrupted less than 5% of the time.

Spot Instances are ideal when there is a queue or buffer in place, or where
there are multiple resources working independently to process the
requests (for example, Hadoop data processing). Typically these
workloads are fault-tolerant, stateless, and flexible, such as
batch processing, big data and analytics, containerized
environments, and high performance computing (HPC). Non-critical
workloads such as test and development environments are also
candidates for Spot.

Spot Instances are also integrated into multiple AWS services,
such as Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling groups, Amazon EMR, Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS), and AWS Batch.

When a Spot Instance needs to be reclaimed, Amazon EC2 sends a two-minute
warning via a Spot Instance interruption notice delivered through
CloudWatch Events, as well as in the instance metadata. During
that two-minute period, your application can use the time to save
its state, drain running containers, upload final log files, or
remove itself from a load balancer. At the end of the two minutes,
you have the option to hibernate, stop, or terminate the Spot
Instance.

Consider the following best practices when adopting Spot Instances
in your workloads:

- **Be flexible across as many instance
  types as possible:** Be flexible in both the family
  and size of the instance type, to improve the likelihood of
  fulfilling your target capacity requirements, obtain the
  lowest possible cost, and minimize the impact of
  interruptions.
- **Be flexible about where your workload
  will run:** Available capacity can vary by
  Availability Zone. This improves the likelihood of fulfilling
  your target capacity by tapping into multiple spare capacity
  pools, and provides the lowest possible cost.
- **Design for continuity:**
  Design your workloads for statelessness and fault-tolerance,
  so that if some of your EC2 capacity gets interrupted, it will
  not have impact on the availability or performance of the
  workload.
- We recommend using Spot Instances in combination with
  On-Demand and Savings Plans/Reserved Instances to maximize
  workload cost optimization with performance.

**Commitment discounts – Savings Plans:** AWS provides a number of ways
for you to reduce your costs by reserving or committing to use a certain amount of resources,
and receiving a discounted rate for your resources. A [Savings Plan](https://aws.amazon.com/savingsplans/ "https://aws.amazon.com/savingsplans/") allows you to make an hourly spend commitment for
one or three years, and receive discounted pricing across your resources. Savings Plans provide
discounts for AWS Compute services such as Amazon EC2, AWS Fargate, and AWS Lambda. When you
make the commitment, you pay that commitment amount every hour, and it is subtracted from your
On-Demand usage at the discount rate. For example, you commit to $50 an hour, and have $150 an
hour of On-Demand usage. Considering the Savings Plans pricing, your specific usage has a discount
rate of 50%. So, your $50 commitment covers $100 of On-Demand usage. You will pay $50
(commitment) and $50 of remaining On-Demand usage.

[Compute
Savings Plans](https://aws.amazon.com/savingsplans/pricing/ "https://aws.amazon.com/savingsplans/pricing/") are the most flexible and provide a discount
of up to 66%. They automatically apply across Availability Zones,
instance size, instance family, operating system, tenancy, Region,
and compute service.

[Instance Savings Plans](https://aws.amazon.com/savingsplans/pricing/ "https://aws.amazon.com/savingsplans/pricing/") have less
flexibility but provide a higher discount rate (up to 72%). They automatically apply across
Availability Zones, instance size, operating system, and tenancy.

There are three payment options:

- **No upfront payment:** There
  is no upfront payment; you then pay a reduced hourly rate each
  month for the total hours in the month.
- **Partial upfront payment:**
  Provides a higher discount rate than No upfront. Part of the
  usage is paid up front; you then pay a smaller reduced hourly
  rate each month for the total hours in the month.
- **All upfront payment:** Usage
  for the entire period is paid up front, and no other costs are
  incurred for the remainder of the term for usage that is
  covered by the commitment.

You can apply any combination of these three purchasing options
across your workloads.

Savings plans apply first to the usage in the account they are
purchased in, from the highest discount percentage to the lowest,
then they apply to the consolidated usage across all other
accounts, from the highest discount percentage to the lowest.

It is recommended to purchase all Savings Plans in an account with
no usage or resources, such as the management account. This ensures
that the Savings Plan applies to the highest discount rates across
all of your usage, maximizing the discount amount.

Workloads and usage typically change over time. It is recommended
to continually purchase small amounts of Savings Plans commitment
over time. This ensures that you maintain high levels of coverage
to maximize your discounts, and your plans closely match your
workload and organization requirements at all times.

Do not set a target coverage in your accounts, due to the
variability of discount that is possible. Low coverage does not
necessarily indicate high potential savings. You may have a low
coverage in your account, but if your usage is made up of small
instances, with a licensed operating system, the potential saving
could be as low as a few percent. Instead, track and monitor the
potential savings available in the Savings Plan recommendation
tool. Frequently review the Savings Plans recommendations in Cost Explorer (perform regular analysis) and continue to purchase
commitments until the estimated savings are below the required
discount for the organization. For example, track and monitor that
your potential discounts remained below 20%, if it goes above that
a purchase must be made.

Monitor the utilization and coverage, but only to detect changes.
Do not aim for a specific utilization percent, or coverage
percent, as this does not necessarily scale with savings. Ensure
that a purchase of Savings Plans results in an increase in
coverage, and if there are decreases in coverage or utilization
ensure they are quantified and known. For example, you migrate a
workload resource to a newer instance type, which reduces
utilization of an existing plan, but the performance benefit
outweighs the saving reduction.

**Commitment discounts – Reserved Instances/Commitment:** Similar
to Savings Plans, [Reserved
Instances](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/reserved-instances/ "https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/reserved-instances/") (RI) offer discounts up to 72% for a commitment to running a minimum
amount of resources. Reserved Instances are available for Amazon RDS, Amazon OpenSearch Service, Amazon ElastiCache,
Amazon Redshift, and DynamoDB. Amazon CloudFront and AWS Elemental MediaConvert also provide discounts when you make minimum usage
commitments. Reserved Instances are currently available for Amazon EC2, however Savings Plans offer the
same discount levels with increased flexibility and no management overhead.

Reserved Instances offer the same pricing options of no upfront, partial upfront, and all
upfront, and the same terms of one or three years.

Reserved Instances can be purchased in a Region or a specific Availability Zone. They
provide a capacity reservation when purchased in an Availability Zone.

Amazon EC2 features convertible RIs, however, Savings Plans should be used for all EC2 instances due to
increased flexibility and reduced operational costs.

The same process and metrics should be used to track and make purchases of Reserved
Instances. It is recommended to not track coverage of RIs across your accounts. It is also
recommended that utilization percentage is not monitored or tracked, instead view the
utilization report in Cost Explorer, and use net savings column in the table. If the net savings is a
significantly large negative amount, you must take action to remediate the unused RI.

**EC2 Fleet:**
[EC2
Fleet](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2018/04/introducing-amazon-ec2-fleet/ "https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2018/04/introducing-amazon-ec2-fleet/") is a feature that allows you to define a target
compute capacity, and then specify the instance types and the
balance of On-Demand and Spot Instances for the fleet. EC2 Fleet will
automatically launch the lowest price combination of resources to
meet the defined capacity.

**Geographic selection:** When you architect your solutions, a
best practice is to seek to place computing resources closer to users to provide lower latency
and strong data sovereignty. For global audiences, you should use multiple locations to meet
these needs. You should select the geographic location that minimizes your costs.

The AWS Cloud infrastructure is built around [Regions and Availability
Zones](../../../AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-regions-availability-zones.md "../../../AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-regions-availability-zones.md"). A Region is a physical location in the world where we have multiple
Availability Zones. Availability Zones consist of one or more discrete data centers, each with
redundant power, networking, and connectivity, housed in separate facilities.

Each AWS Region operates within local market conditions, and
resource pricing is different in each Region. Choose a specific
Region to operate a component of or your entire solution so that
you can run at the lowest possible price globally. You can use the
AWS Simple Monthly Calculator to estimate the costs of your
workload in various Regions.

**Third-party agreements and
pricing:** When you use third-party solutions or
services in the cloud, it is important that the pricing structures
are aligned to Cost Optimization outcomes. Pricing should scale
with the outcomes and value it provides. An example of this is
software that takes a percentage of savings it provides, the more
you save (outcome) the more it charges. Agreements that scale with
your bill are typically not aligned to Cost Optimization, unless
they provide outcomes for every part of your specific bill. For
example, a solution that provides recommendations for Amazon EC2 and
charges a percentage of your entire bill will increase if you use
other services for which it provides no benefit. Another example
is a managed service that is charged at a percentage of the cost
of resources that are managed. A larger instance size may not
necessarily require more management effort, but will be charged
more. Ensure that these service pricing arrangements include a
cost optimization program or features in their service to drive
efficiency.
