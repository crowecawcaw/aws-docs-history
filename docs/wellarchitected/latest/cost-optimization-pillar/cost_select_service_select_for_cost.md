# COST05-BP05 Select components of this workload to optimize cost

in line with organization priorities

Factor in cost when selecting all components for your workload. This
includes using application-level and managed services or serverless,
containers, or event-driven architecture to reduce overall cost.
Minimize license costs by using open-source software, software that
does not have license fees, or alternatives to reduce spending.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** Medium

## Implementation guidance

Consider the cost of services and options when selecting all
components. This includes using application level and managed
services, such as
[Amazon Relational Database Service](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/ "https://aws.amazon.com/rds/") (Amazon RDS),
[Amazon DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/ "https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/"),
[Amazon Simple Notification Service](https://aws.amazon.com/sns/ "https://aws.amazon.com/sns/") (Amazon SNS), and
[Amazon Simple Email Service](https://aws.amazon.com/ses/ "https://aws.amazon.com/ses/") (Amazon SES) to reduce overall organization cost.

Use serverless and containers for compute, such as
[AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/ "https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/") and
[Amazon Simple Storage Service](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/ "https://aws.amazon.com/s3/") (Amazon S3) for static websites.
Containerize your application if possible and use AWS Managed
Container Services such as
[Amazon Elastic Container Service](https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/ "https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/") (Amazon ECS) or
[Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/ "https://aws.amazon.com/eks/") (Amazon EKS).

Minimize license costs by using open-source software, or software
that does not have license fees (for example, Amazon Linux for
compute workloads or migrate databases to Amazon Aurora).

You can use serverless or application-level services such as
[Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/ "https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/"),
[Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS)](https://aws.amazon.com/sqs/ "https://aws.amazon.com/sqs/"),
[Amazon SNS](https://aws.amazon.com/sqs/ "https://aws.amazon.com/sqs/"), and
[Amazon SES](https://aws.amazon.com/ses/ "https://aws.amazon.com/ses/"). These services remove the need for
you to manage a resource and provide the function of code
execution, queuing services, and message delivery. The other
benefit is that they scale in performance and cost in line with
usage, allowing efficient cost allocation and attribution.

Using
[event-driven
architecture](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/eda/ "https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/eda/") is also possible with serverless services.
Event-driven architectures are push-based, so everything happens
on demand as the event presents itself in the router. This way,
you’re not paying for continuous polling to check for an event.
This means less network bandwidth consumption, less CPU
utilization, less idle fleet capacity, and fewer SSL/TLS
handshakes.

Serverless Application lens whitepaper.](../serverless-applications-lens/welcome.md "../serverless-applications-lens/welcome.md")

### Implementation steps

- **Select each service to optimize
  cost:** Using your prioritized list and analysis,
  select each option that provides the best match with your
  organizational priorities. Instead of increasing the
  capacity to meet the demand, consider other options which
  may give you better performance with lower cost. For
  example, if you need to review expected traffic for your
  databases on AWS, consider either increasing the instance
  size or using Amazon ElastiCache services (Redis or Memcached)
  to provide cached mechanisms for your databases.
- **Evaluate event-driven
  architecture:** Using serverless architecture also
  allows you to build event-driven architecture for
  distributed microservice-based applications, which helps you
  build scalable, resilient, agile and cost-effective
  solutions.
