# AGENTREL01-BP02 Establish modular, fault-isolated layers

Monolithic agent architectures force every fault to become a
full-system fault. Splitting compute, memory, reasoning, and
orchestration into independently scalable layers with fail-fast
boundaries keeps the scope of impact small. Teams keep serving
requests at reduced capability instead of going unavailable.

**Desired outcome:**

- Your agent stack is split into distinct layers (compute, memory,
  reasoning, orchestration, and tool integration) with documented
  API contracts at each boundary.
- You have fail-fast behavior on inter-layer calls, with defined
  fallback modes for each degraded state.
- You can toggle non-critical capabilities at runtime without
  redeploying.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- Deploying monolithic agents where a failure in any component
  forces a full restart for issues that should be isolated.
- Running without automatic cutoffs, allowing latency or error
  rates in one component to propagate through every dependent
  call.
- Treating all capabilities as equally critical, missing the
  chance to keep core functionality available when non-essential
  components fail.

**Benefits of establishing this best
practice:**

- Teams can develop, test, and deploy individual layers
  independently without blocking on the rest of the stack.
- Fault isolation narrows troubleshooting to the layer that
  actually failed rather than the whole system.
- Graceful degradation keeps agents responsive even when
  individual layers are unavailable.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** High

## Implementation guidance

AgentCore Runtime organizes capabilities into distinct layers
(Runtime, Memory, Gateway, and Identity), each addressable
independently. Design your agents to treat these as separate
failure domains. If Memory becomes unavailable, your agent's
routing logic (Gateway) and authentication (Identity) should
continue functioning. Implement health checks per layer and
configure independent timeout and retry policies for each, rather
than treating AgentCore as a monolithic dependency.

When a downstream layer's error rate climbs, the caller should
stop waiting for timeouts and activate a fallback. Examples
include session-only context instead of long-term memory, an
alternative Amazon Bedrock model instead of the primary, or a
cached answer instead of fresh retrieval. Without fail-fast, every
degraded call consumes thread budget and propagates latency back
to the user. The
[AWS fail-fast pattern guidance](../../../prescriptive-guidance/latest/cloud-design-patterns/circuit-breaker.md "../../../prescriptive-guidance/latest/cloud-design-patterns/circuit-breaker.md") covers the mechanics.

Runtime capability toggling keeps the scope of impact small during
an incident. If one tool is flaky, turn that tool off and keep the
rest of the agent operational rather than taking the whole agent
down. Publish structured health status per layer through
[Amazon
Bedrock AgentCore Observability](../../../bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/observability.md "../../../bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/observability.md") so downstream components
adapt to the toggle state automatically. Service maps give
operators the view they need to correlate layer health to
user-visible symptoms.

### Implementation steps

1. **Decompose the architecture into
   layers with documented contracts:** Split the agent
   into distinct layers for compute, memory, cognition,
   orchestration, and tool integration. Publish the API
   contract at every boundary.
2. **Deploy each layer independently on
   AgentCore Runtime:** Run each layer on
   [Amazon
   Bedrock AgentCore Runtime](../../../bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/agents-tools-runtime.md "../../../bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/agents-tools-runtime.md") with no shared execution
   resources between layers.
3. **Implement fail-fast logic per
   inter-layer call:** For each call boundary, define
   the error-rate threshold that trips the cutoff and the
   fallback behavior that takes over.
4. **Publish structured layer health
   through AgentCore Observability:** Emit per-layer
   health signals through
   [Amazon
   Bedrock AgentCore Observability](../../../bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/observability.md "../../../bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/observability.md") so downstream
   components can adapt and operators can trace degradation to
   its source.
5. **Wire runtime capability
   toggling:** Build a control plane that disables
   non-critical capabilities without redeployment so operators
   can contain incidents as they happen.
