<a name="agentcost06-bp03"></a>

 Cold starts are a significant per-invocation cost in agent infrastructure, where model loading, tool registration, and memory hydration run on every fresh session. You can reduce those per-invocation costs through persistent filesystems, session affinity, and lazy context loading to reuse results while still scaling to zero for agents that are rarely called. 

 **Desired outcome:** 
+  You amortize initialization costs across many invocations by caching artifacts on a persistent filesystem. 
+  You have frequently invoked agents reusing warm sessions and infrequent agents scaling to zero without idle charges. 
+  You defer non-essential context retrieval to on-demand, keeping initialization under a fixed time budget. 
+  You track cold start rates and initialization costs per agent type. 

 **Common anti-patterns:** 
+  Performing expensive initialization on every invocation instead of caching artifacts across sessions. 
+  Allowing frequently invoked agents to repeatedly incur cold starts without session persistence or warm pool patterns. 
+  Loading all potentially relevant context at startup instead of lazy-loading on demand, increasing initialization latency with data that may never be used. 
+  Operating agents without cold start visibility, missing opportunities to apply warm pool patterns or optimize initialization for high-impact agents. Agent cold starts include model loading, tool registration, and memory hydration, not just container startup. 

 **Benefits of establishing this best practice:** 
+  Persistent filesystem caching amortizes initialization costs across many invocations, avoiding repeated overhead. 
+  Session lifecycle management maintains warm sessions for frequent agents while scaling to zero for infrequent ones without idle charges. 
+  Lazy context loading reduces initialization time by deferring non-essential retrieval until reasoning requires it. 

 **Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established:** High 

## Implementation guidance

 [Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Runtime](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/agents-tools-runtime.html) implements warm pool behavior through its session lifecycle. Sessions move through Active, Idle, and Terminated states. Active handles processing, Idle maintains session readiness after inactivity timeout without compute charges, and Terminated ends the session at expiration or maximum lifetime. Frequently invoked agents keep warm sessions through the idle window while infrequent agents scale to zero, so you don't pay idle capacity for agents that are not being called. Tune idle timeout based on invocation frequency to balance responsiveness with session overhead. 

 The persistent filesystem makes initialization caching worthwhile to implement. The filesystem survives session stop and resume cycles for up to 14 days, so expensive initialization artifacts (model state, tool configurations, and preloaded reference data) can be computed once on the first invocation and reused across many later sessions. The 14-day retention shapes your caching strategy: plan artifact refresh and cache invalidation to fit inside the window, so cached data never ages out silently and never gets stale beyond the refresh point. 

 Session affinity optimizes costs by keeping the same runtimeSessionId across related invocations so loaded models and cached tool configurations are reused. Implement session tracking in the orchestration layer so user workflows map to consistent session identifiers, and monitor session reuse rates to confirm routing is avoiding unnecessary initialization overhead. If cold start rates rise above 10%, investigate affinity or idle timeout misconfiguration before optimizing the initialization logic itself. 

 Consider *lazy context loading*, where data is fetched or parsed only when it is required. [Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Memory](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/memory.html) supports retrieving only minimal startup context (the user's current task and immediate session history), deferring long-term memory and knowledge base retrieval until the agent actually needs the data. This keeps initialization time under a 2-second target covering model loading and tool registration. Monitor cold start rates and initialization costs through [Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Observability](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/observability.html), build Amazon CloudWatch dashboards for initialization duration and session reuse by agent type, and review idle timeout configuration monthly based on observed invocation patterns. 

### Implementation steps
<a name="implementation-steps"></a>

1.  **Cache initialization artifacts on persistent storage:** Configure [Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Runtime](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/agents-tools-runtime.html) with persistent filesystem (surviving up to 14 days across session cycles) and implement initialization logic that checks for cached artifacts before performing expensive operations. 

1.  **Apply session affinity:** Maintain consistent runtimeSessionId values across related invocations so warm session state (loaded models, cached tool configurations) is reused. 

1.  **Defer non-essential context:** Configure [Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Memory](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/memory.html) for lazy loading of startup context, deferring additional retrieval to on-demand during reasoning, with an initialization time target under 2 seconds. 

1.  **Monitor cold start rates per agent type:** Instrument agents with [Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Observability](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/observability.html) to track session creation latency, initialization duration (model loading and tool registration), and cold start rates, with alarms for rates exceeding 10%.
