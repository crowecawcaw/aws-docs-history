# AGENTREL03-BP03 Implement comprehensive state management and checkpoint-based recovery

Long-running workflows without checkpoints pay the full restart cost
for every failure, no matter how late it happens. Persisting state
at natural boundaries and designing every step to be idempotent lets
an agent resume from the last completed checkpoint rather than redo
work.

**Desired outcome:**

- You have workflow state persisted at regular checkpoints, so
  interruptions resume from the last completed point rather than
  the beginning.
- You have idempotent workflow steps that produce the same result
  when replayed with the same input.
- You have a checkpoint lifecycle with TTL-based expiration and
  explicit cleanup after completion.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- Running long-duration agent workflows without intermediate state
  persistence, forcing complete restarts on any failure.
- Implementing checkpoints without idempotency guarantees,
  producing data corruption or duplicate side effects on resume.
- Skipping checkpoint cleanup, accumulating storage indefinitely.

**Benefits of establishing this best
practice:**

- Workflow restart cost drops because resume starts from the last
  checkpoint.
- Duplicate work is prevented through idempotent checkpoint-based
  recovery.
- Compute efficiency improves because recovery avoids redundant
  recomputation.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** High

## Implementation guidance

Checkpointing is only useful if recovery is safe, and recovery is
only safe if steps are idempotent. An idempotent step produces the
same result whether it runs once or five times with the same
input, which means a retry or a resume doesn't add duplicate side
effects. This constraint shapes everything downstream. External
calls need idempotency keys, state mutations need conditional
writes, and event emissions need deduplication logic. Without
idempotency guarantees, checkpoint-based recovery can produce
duplicate side effects or data corruption. Design each step to be
idempotent before implementing checkpointing.

Runtime choice determines how much checkpointing discipline you
need to build yourself.
[Amazon
Bedrock AgentCore Runtime](../../../bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/agents-tools-runtime.md "../../../bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/agents-tools-runtime.md") supports long-running workloads
with managed session storage that persists filesystem state across
stop and resume cycles, which covers the coarse-grained case. For
workflow-stage-aware checkpointing with redrive from specific
failure points, orchestrate through
[AWS Step Functions](../../../step-functions/latest/dg/welcome.md "../../../step-functions/latest/dg/welcome.md"). Step Functions persists execution state at
every transition and enables restart from the point of failure
rather than from the beginning. For dynamic workflows driven by
supervisor agents, callback patterns pause execution while the
supervisor decides the next action, preserving state persistence
benefits.

Lifecycle management keeps the checkpoint store from growing
without bound. TTL-based expiration handles the common case:
workflows that never complete eventually age out. Explicit cleanup
after successful completion reclaims space immediately. Use
[Amazon
Bedrock AgentCore Memory](../../../bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/memory.md "../../../bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/memory.md") to persist checkpoint state and
specification context for agents requiring custom checkpointing.
Monitor checkpoint store health through
[Amazon
Bedrock AgentCore Observability](../../../bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/observability.md "../../../bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/observability.md") so storage growth or access
latency surfaces before recovery starts failing.

### Implementation steps

1. **Deploy agents on AgentCore Runtime
   with managed session storage:** Use
   [Amazon
   Bedrock AgentCore Runtime](../../../bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/agents-tools-runtime.md "../../../bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/agents-tools-runtime.md") for filesystem-level state
   persistence across stop and resume cycles.
2. **Orchestrate multi-step workflows
   through Step Functions:** Use
   [AWS Step Functions](../../../step-functions/latest/dg/welcome.md "../../../step-functions/latest/dg/welcome.md") for state persistence at every
   transition with redrive capability from the point of
   failure.
3. **Design every workflow step to be
   idempotent:** Require idempotency keys on external
   calls and conditional writes on state mutations so retries
   and resumes don't introduce duplicate side effects.
4. **Use AgentCore Memory for custom
   checkpoint state:** Persist checkpoint state and
   specification context through
   [Amazon
   Bedrock AgentCore Memory](../../../bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/memory.md "../../../bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/memory.md") for agents with bespoke
   checkpointing needs.
5. **Implement checkpoint lifecycle
   management:** Set TTL-based expiration and explicit
   cleanup after successful completion so the checkpoint store
   stays bounded.
