# AGENTSUS02-BP02 Establish efficient agent caching strategies

Every duplicate model call, tool invocation, and memory lookup is
work the agent fleet has already done once. Caching at each
integration point turns repeated work into a one-time cost amortized
across every caller, so resource efficiency improves as usage
patterns stabilize rather than scaling linearly with traffic.

**Desired outcome:**

- You have caching applied at each integration point, prompt
  prefixes, tool results, memory lookups, and credential
  validation, with TTLs matched to data volatility.
- Cache layers are shared across the agent fleet so one agent's
  cached result benefits every other agent.
- Cache hit rates are tracked per integration point and improve as
  usage patterns stabilize.
- Invalidation policies help prevent stale responses where data
  volatility demands freshness.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- Making repeated calls to the same foundation model with the same
  stable prompt prefix instead of caching it, paying to reprocess
  the same tokens on every invocation.
- Caching tool results and model responses without invalidation or
  TTL policies, producing stale answers that appear fresh.
- Running caches isolated to each agent that don't share across
  the fleet, so each agent has to re-warm its own cache rather
  than benefiting from cached results elsewhere.
- Skipping cache instrumentation, so nobody knows which
  integration points have low hit rates and would benefit from a
  different caching strategy.

**Benefits of establishing this best
practice:**

- Redundant processing, API calls, and network traffic are reduced
  at each integration point, so infrastructure cost grows
  sublinearly with agent usage.
- Shared cache layers mean adding agents to the fleet increases
  cache hit rate rather than cache pressure.
- Resource efficiency compounds over time as cache hit rates climb
  toward their steady-state maximum.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** Medium

## Implementation guidance

The sustainability view of prompt caching adds one additional
consideration to this lens' existing performance and cost
perspectives. The value of caching isn't just latency or cost for
each call. It's cumulative compute and energy footprint across the
lifetime of the fleet, and the way caching is shared determines
how that cumulative footprint grows.

Caches isolated to each agent don't compound. If five agents each
maintain their own cache, the fleet warms five caches instead of
one, and cross-agent hits never happen. Shared cache layers
exposed through
[Amazon
Bedrock AgentCore Gateway](../../../bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/gateway.md "../../../bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/gateway.md") MCP server capabilities reverse
this. Every agent reads from and writes to the same cache tier, so
one agent's tool result becomes the next agent's cache hit. The
same principle applies at the authentication layer.
[Amazon
Bedrock AgentCore Identity](../../../bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/identity.md "../../../bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/identity.md") caches tokens so credential
validation happens once per session across the fleet rather than
once for each agent.

[Amazon
Bedrock prompt caching](../../../bedrock/latest/userguide/prompt-caching.md "../../../bedrock/latest/userguide/prompt-caching.md") pays off fastest. Stable system
prompts, the long preambles that set agent behavior, can be cached
at the model layer so subsequent invocations skip reprocessing the
prefix. Semantic caching adds a complementary layer where similar
(not identical) queries serve cached responses after an
embedding-based match, which is especially valuable for the long
tail of paraphrased questions users ask.

Invalidation is where caching strategies can fail. A cache TTL
calibrated to daily refresh on data that actually changes hourly
serves stale content. A TTL too short to matter wastes the cache's
whole purpose. Pick TTLs based on how often the underlying data
actually changes, and track hit rates through
[Amazon
Bedrock AgentCore Observability](../../../bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/observability.md "../../../bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/observability.md") so low-performing
strategies get tuned rather than left in place.

### Implementation steps

1. **Enable prompt caching for stable
   prefixes:** Turn on
   [Amazon
   Bedrock prompt caching](../../../bedrock/latest/userguide/prompt-caching.md "../../../bedrock/latest/userguide/prompt-caching.md") for stable system prompts
   following the patterns in
   [AGENTPERF03-BP04
   Establish efficient agent caching and data access
   patterns](agentperf03-bp04.md "agentperf03-bp04.md") and
   [AGENTCOST02-BP03
   Leverage intelligent caching to reduce redundant model
   invocations](agentcost02-bp03.md "agentcost02-bp03.md").
2. **Share cache layers across the
   fleet:** Expose tool result and semantic caches
   through
   [Amazon
   Bedrock AgentCore Gateway](../../../bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/gateway.md "../../../bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/gateway.md") MCP server capabilities so
   every agent reads from and writes to the same store.
3. **Cache credential
   validation:** Use
   [Amazon
   Bedrock AgentCore Identity](../../../bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/identity.md "../../../bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/identity.md") to cache tokens so
   authentication overhead happens once per session rather than
   once per agent invocation.
4. **Set TTLs based on data
   volatility:** Pick invalidation policies calibrated
   to how often the underlying data actually changes, shorter
   for live operational data, longer for stable reference
   material.
5. **Monitor and refine hit
   rates:** Track cache hit rates per integration
   point through
   [Amazon
   Bedrock AgentCore Observability](../../../bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/observability.md "../../../bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/observability.md") and adjust strategies
   where hit rates are below expectations.
