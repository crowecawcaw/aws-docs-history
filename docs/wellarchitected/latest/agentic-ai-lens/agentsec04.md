# Agent goal alignment and manipulation prevention
<a name="agentsec04"></a>

 Agents can be directed to pursue unintended objectives or exhibit behaviors outside their defined scope. Without goal alignment mechanisms, agents might take actions that conflict with organizational policies or user intent. Implementing guardrails, layered validation controls, and human-in-the-loop approvals helps verify that agents operate within intended boundaries. 


|  AGENTSEC04: How do you support agent goal alignment and prevent manipulation?  |

|   | 

## Capability intent
<a name="capability-intent-3"></a>
+  Operational and policy boundaries for each agent are defined up front and enforced through layered controls rather than prompt instructions alone. 
+  Deterministic enforcement (IAM scoping, input schema validation, and policy engines) and probabilistic content controls (input and output filtering, behavioral evaluation) operate at distinct stages of the call chain, so a failure at one layer rarely results in a boundary violation. 
+  Risk classification is deterministic, with high-risk operations routed to human review before execution and routine low-risk operations proceeding autonomously. 
+  Reviewers receive sufficient decision context, timeout policies, and escalation paths to make informed approvals without stalling the workflow or defaulting to rubber-stamping. 
+  Guardrail interventions, approval decisions, and evaluation results are logged, alerted on, and reviewed on a defined cadence to keep policies current with emerging patterns. 

## Maturity levels
<a name="maturity-levels-3"></a>

 These levels summarize what each stage of maturity looks like for agent goal alignment and manipulation prevention as a whole. 


|  Level  |  Name  |  What it looks like  | 
| --- | --- | --- | 
|  1  |  Initial  |  Operational boundaries exist only as natural-language instructions in the system prompt. No content guardrails, input validation, or human-in-the-loop controls are in place. Alignment depends on the model following instructions, and a single adversarial input can redirect the agent with no defense in depth.  | 
|  2  |  Emerging  |  [Amazon Bedrock Guardrails](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/guardrails.html) are configured with basic [content filters](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/guardrails-content-filter.html) covering inputs and outputs. A single approval tier exists for a subset of consequential actions, implemented through built-in mechanisms such as [Amazon Bedrock Agents user confirmation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/agents-userconfirmation.html) or routed through ad-hoc channels such as email or chat. Guardrail interventions are captured in logs but reviewed irregularly.  | 
|  3  |  Defined  |  Tiered guardrail configurations align filter strengths to each agent's use case, and [denied topics and word filters](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/guardrails-content-filters-overview.html) are calibrated per risk profile. Deterministic risk classification routes approvals through a structured workflow mechanism such as [AWS Step Functions callback workflows](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/latest/dg/connect-to-resource.html) or [return of control](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/agents-returncontrol.html), with defined timeouts and escalation paths. [Amazon CloudWatch alarms](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/AlarmThatSendsEmail.html) fire on intervention spikes, and guardrail versioning supports rollback of policy changes.  | 
|  4  |  Proactive  |  Validation runs at every stage of the call chain: input, inference, output, and tool invocation. [Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Evaluations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/evaluations.html) run on a defined cadence with alarms on correctness, tool selection accuracy, and safety score drift. Persistent trust grants are scoped narrowly by command and parameter shape, tiered by risk, and made auditable and revocable. Full decision context is written to durable storage before approval notifications, and approval records are linked to the centralized audit trail.  | 
|  5  |  Optimized  |  Alignment controls are calibrated from intervention and evaluation data, and risk classification adapts to dynamic signals such as operation frequency, time of day, and source location. Multi-reviewer consensus is available for the highest-risk operations, including asynchronous workflows running on [Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Runtime](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/runtime.html). Policy updates flow through versioned configurations with provable change history, and the feedback loop from logged interventions back into policy is automated rather than manual.  | 

## Common issues to watch for
<a name="common-issues-to-watch-for-3"></a>
+  Alignment is treated as a prompt-engineering exercise rather than a layered enforcement problem, so a single adversarial input that influences the model can collapse multiple boundaries at once. 
+  Content filtering is applied only to model outputs, leaving the inference path open to prompt injection and consuming capacity on adversarial inputs that could have been rejected up front. 
+  A single guardrail profile is applied to every agent, which either over-constrains low-risk informational agents or leaves high-risk operational agents under-constrained. 
+  Approval workflows either route every action through human review (producing reviewer fatigue and rubber-stamping) or skip review for operations that warrant it, giving the worst of both extremes. 
+  Risk classification is delegated to an LLM exposed to the same untrusted content as the request it is evaluating, which can be influenced into marking that request as low-risk.
