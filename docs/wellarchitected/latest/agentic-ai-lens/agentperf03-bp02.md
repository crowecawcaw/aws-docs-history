# AGENTPERF03-BP02 Optimize context window utilization and prompt management

Every token sent to an LLM competes for the model's attention,
consumes input-token cost, and adds inference latency, which makes
prompt content a first-order performance lever. Effective context
window management budgets tokens across prompt components, assembles
only what the current task needs, and compresses or summarizes the
rest. Without this discipline, conversation history and tool schemas
crowd out reasoning capacity and inflate latency on every iteration.

**Desired outcome:**

- You have an explicit token budget allocated across prompt
  components, system instructions, conversation history, retrieved
  knowledge, and tool schemas, with per-component token usage
  measured on every request.
- You have context assembled dynamically per request, including
  only the tool definitions, retrieved passages, and conversation
  context relevant to the current task rather than a fixed maximal
  payload.
- You have conversation history bounded by summarization, sliding
  windows, or semantic compression so prompt size doesn't grow
  linearly with session length.
- You have prompt templates versioned and evaluated so changes to
  wording, ordering, or component composition are measured against
  quality and token-cost baselines before rollout.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- Including the full conversation history in every prompt without
  summarization or truncation, causing prompt size and inference
  latency to grow linearly with session length.
- Injecting the full tool catalog in every prompt regardless of
  task relevance, spending context budget on schemas the agent
  will not invoke for the current request.
- Passing RAG retrievals straight into the prompt without
  per-passage filtering or truncation, so low-relevance chunks
  displace more useful context.
- Treating the prompt as a single opaque string rather than a
  composition of components, making it impossible to attribute
  token consumption to system instructions, history, retrievals,
  or tool schemas.
- Shipping prompt changes without versioning or side-by-side
  evaluation, so quality or token-cost regressions are detected
  only after rollout.

**Benefits of establishing this best
practice:**

- Removing tokens from the prompt can reduce request cost and
  shorten time-to-first-token on each iteration.
- Pruned, high-density context leaves more of the model's
  effective attention on the current task instead of parsing stale
  history or unused tool schemas.
- Summarization and sliding-window strategies decouple prompt size
  from conversation length, keeping per-turn latency and cost
  stable.
- Stable, component-structured prompts with invariant prefixes
  compose with prompt caching, turning a large portion of input
  tokens into cached reads at a fraction of standard input cost.
- Versioned templates with evaluation gates let prompt changes
  ship with quality and cost evidence rather than by guess.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** High

## Implementation guidance

Prompts behave as compositions of discrete components, system
instructions, tool schemas, retrieved knowledge, conversation
history, and the current user turn. Treating them as a single
opaque string makes runaway growth impossible to attribute.
Per-component token attribution on every request demystifies
issues, such as a tool catalog that doubled when a new tool was
registered. Component-level budgets that sum to the workload's
input-length target make the trade-offs explicit: more budget for
retrievals means less for history, and every reallocation becomes
a deliberate decision.

The
[Amazon
Bedrock prompt design guidance](../../../bedrock/latest/userguide/design-a-prompt.md "../../../bedrock/latest/userguide/design-a-prompt.md") describes how clear
instructions, output indicators, and question placement at the end
of the prompt shape the system-instruction and user-turn
components individually.

The cheapest tokens are the ones never sent. Most agents register
many more tools than any single turn will invoke, so injecting the
full tool catalog on every request spends context budget on
schemas the model ignores.
[Amazon
Bedrock AgentCore Gateway](../../../bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/gateway-advanced-performance.md "../../../bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/gateway-advanced-performance.md") addresses this with semantic
search that returns only the tools relevant to the current user
intent.

Retrieval-augmented context suffers from the same failure mode,
passing raw top-K passages into the prompt without a relevance
threshold or per-passage cap lets low-signal chunks displace
higher-signal context.

Conversation history is the third inflation source: the
[SummaryMemoryStrategy
in Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Memory](../../../bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/long-term-configuring-built-in-strategies.md#long-term-session-summaries-strategy "../../../bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/long-term-configuring-built-in-strategies.md#long-term-session-summaries-strategy") maintains a running
per-session summary that replaces raw turns after the session
exceeds a threshold, decoupling prompt size from session length so
per-turn latency remains stable as conversations grow.

Static prefixes unlock large, recurring input-token savings.
[Amazon
Bedrock prompt caching](../../../bedrock/latest/userguide/prompt-caching.md "../../../bedrock/latest/userguide/prompt-caching.md") accepts cache checkpoints in the
system, tools, and
messages fields on the Converse API, with cache
reads charged at a reduced rate on a 5-minute default TTL, or a
1-hour TTL on Claude Opus 4.5, Haiku 4.5, and Sonnet 4.5 for
longer-running or intermittent agent traffic.

Invariant content (system instructions, stable tool definitions,
and pinned context) belongs before the checkpoint, and variable
content (current user turn and session-specific retrievals)
belongs after it so the cached prefix remains identical across
turns. Simplified cache management for Claude models looks back
approximately 20 content blocks for the longest matching prefix,
so the most-reused content should sit within that range.

Prompts behave like code, so a change to wording, component order,
or a tool description can shift quality, token count, and
cache-hit rate simultaneously, while the effects remain invisible
until rollout unless they are measured.
[Amazon
Bedrock Prompt management](../../../bedrock/latest/userguide/prompt-management-create.md "../../../bedrock/latest/userguide/prompt-management-create.md") stores prompts as versioned
artifacts with variables, inference configuration, and optional
prompt-caching settings, and its console variant comparison
surfaces quality and token differences side by side before
promotion.

[Prompt
Optimization](../../../bedrock/latest/userguide/prompt-management-optimize.md "../../../bedrock/latest/userguide/prompt-management-optimize.md") generates model-specific rewrites that serve
as candidate variants rather than drop-in replacements, and
quality plus token-cost benchmarks on representative test sets
should gate promotion of any variant.

### Implementation steps

1. **Define the prompt component taxonomy
   and per-component token budget:** Decompose every
   prompt into a fixed set of components, system instructions,
   tool schemas, retrieved knowledge, conversation history, and
   the current user turn, and allocate a token budget to each
   that sums to the input-length target derived from the
   workload's latency and cost SLO. Apply the
   [Amazon
   Bedrock prompt design guidance](../../../bedrock/latest/userguide/design-a-prompt.md "../../../bedrock/latest/userguide/design-a-prompt.md") to keep the
   system-instruction component clear, concise, and consistent
   with the user query placed at the end of the prompt.
2. **Instrument per-component token usage
   on every request:** Emit token counts for each
   component as structured logs or CloudWatch metrics alongside
   the inputTokens and
   outputTokens returned by the
   [Amazon
   Bedrock Converse API](../../../bedrock/latest/APIReference/API_runtime_Converse.md "../../../bedrock/latest/APIReference/API_runtime_Converse.md"), dimensioned by agent ID and
   task type. Include cacheReadInputTokens
   and cacheWriteInputTokens from the
   Converse response so cache effectiveness is measured
   alongside component growth, and alert when any component
   trends outside its budget before it impacts the end-to-end
   SLO.
3. **Assemble tool schemas dynamically
   with just-in-time selection:** Replace full-catalog
   injection with task-relevant selection so the prompt carries
   only the tools the agent might invoke for the current turn.
   For agents using
   [Amazon
   Bedrock AgentCore Gateway](../../../bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/gateway-advanced-performance.md "../../../bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/gateway-advanced-performance.md"), enable semantic search by
   setting
   "searchType": "SEMANTIC"
   on the mcp protocol in the gateway's
   protocolConfiguration so tool retrieval
   narrows on user intent. Keep each tool's schema compact with
   clear parameter descriptions and required fields to reduce
   its per-invocation token weight.
4. **Bound conversation history with
   summarization and a sliding window:** Cap raw-turn
   retention and replace older turns with a running summary
   after the session exceeds a threshold expressed in turns or
   tokens. Configure the
   [SummaryMemoryStrategy
   in Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Memory](../../../bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/long-term-configuring-built-in-strategies.md#long-term-session-summaries-strategy "../../../bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/long-term-configuring-built-in-strategies.md#long-term-session-summaries-strategy") with a
   namespaceTemplates entry such as
   /summaries/{actorId}/{sessionId}/ and
   inject the summary rather than the raw transcript into the
   prompt, paired with a small sliding window of recent turns
   to preserve near-term conversational detail.
5. **Filter and truncate retrieved
   passages before prompt assembly:** Apply a
   relevance threshold, a per-passage token cap, and a total
   retrieval budget so low-signal chunks can't displace
   higher-signal context. Rank passages by relevance score,
   drop any below the threshold, and truncate long passages to
   the per-passage cap before composing the retrieved-knowledge
   component.
6. **Structure prompts so they compose
   with prompt caching:** Order every prompt so
   invariant content (system instructions, stable tool
   definitions, pinned reference material) appears before
   variant content (user turn, per-request retrievals), then
   place
   [Amazon
   Bedrock prompt cache checkpoints](../../../bedrock/latest/userguide/prompt-caching.md "../../../bedrock/latest/userguide/prompt-caching.md") in the
   system, tools, and
   messages fields at the boundary between
   static and dynamic content. For long-running or intermittent
   sessions on supported Claude models, set
   "ttl": "1h" on the
   cachePoint to extend the cache window
   beyond the 5-minute default, keeping the 1-hour entry ahead
   of any 5-minute entries in the same request.
7. **Version prompts and gate changes on
   evaluation:** Store prompts as versioned artifacts
   in
   [Amazon
   Bedrock Prompt management](../../../bedrock/latest/userguide/prompt-management-create.md "../../../bedrock/latest/userguide/prompt-management-create.md") with variables for dynamic
   inputs and inference configuration tied to the version, then
   use
   [Create
   version](../../../bedrock/latest/userguide/prompt-management-version-create.md "../../../bedrock/latest/userguide/prompt-management-version-create.md") to snapshot known-good drafts. Use the
   side-by-side variant comparison in the prompt builder to
   evaluate candidates against each other, and promote a new
   version only after it clears quality and token-cost
   baselines on a representative test set.
8. **Generate model-tuned rewrites with
   prompt optimization:** Run candidate prompts
   through
   [Amazon
   Bedrock Prompt Optimization](../../../bedrock/latest/userguide/prompt-management-optimize.md "../../../bedrock/latest/userguide/prompt-management-optimize.md") to produce model-specific
   rewrites, passing the target model through
   targetModelId when using the
   OptimizePrompt API. Treat the optimized
   output as a candidate variant rather than a drop-in
   replacement, and compare it against the original on the same
   evaluation set so token-count reductions are weighed against
   any quality impact before promotion.
