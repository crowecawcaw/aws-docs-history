<a name="ops_observability_dist_trace"></a>

 Distributed tracing offers a way to monitor and visualize requests as they traverse through various components of a distributed system. By capturing trace data from multiple sources and analyzing it in a unified view, teams can better understand how requests flow, where bottlenecks exist, and where optimization efforts should focus. 

 **Desired outcome:** Achieve a holistic view of requests flowing through your distributed system, allowing for precise debugging, optimized performance, and improved user experiences. 

 **Common anti-patterns:** 
+  Inconsistent instrumentation: Not all services in a distributed system are instrumented for tracing. 
+  Ignoring latency: Only focusing on errors and not considering the latency or gradual performance degradations. 

 **Benefits of establishing this best practice:** 
+ Comprehensive system overview: Visualizing the entire path of requests, from entry to exit.
+  Enhanced debugging: Quickly identifying where failures or performance issues occur. 
+  Improved user experience: Monitoring and optimizing based on actual user data, ensuring the system meets real-world demands. 

 **Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established:** High 

## Implementation guidance
<a name="implementation-guidance"></a>

 Begin by identifying all of the elements of your workload that require instrumentation. Once all components are accounted for, leverage tools such as AWS X-Ray and OpenTelemetry to gather trace data for analysis with tools like X-Ray and Amazon CloudWatch ServiceLens Map. Engage in regular reviews with developers, and supplement these discussions with tools like Amazon DevOps Guru, X-Ray Analytics and X-Ray Insights to help uncover deeper findings. Establish alerts from trace data to notify when outcomes, as defined in the workload monitoring plan, are at risk. 

### Implementation steps

 To implement distributed tracing effectively: 

1.  **Adopt [AWS X-Ray](https://aws.amazon.com/xray/):** Integrate X-Ray into your application to gain insights into its behavior, understand its performance, and pinpoint bottlenecks. Utilize X-Ray Insights for automatic trace analysis. 

1.  **Instrument your services:** Verify that every service, from an [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) function to an [EC2 instance](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/), sends trace data. The more services you instrument, the clearer the end-to-end view. 

1.  **Incorporate [CloudWatch Real User Monitoring](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch-RUM.html) and [synthetic monitoring](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch_Synthetics_Canaries.html):** Integrate Real User Monitoring (RUM) and synthetic monitoring with X-Ray. This allows for capturing real-world user experiences and simulating user interactions to identify potential issues. 

1.  **Use the [CloudWatch agent](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/Install-CloudWatch-Agent.html):** The agent can send traces from either X-Ray or OpenTelemetry, enhancing the depth of insights obtained. 

1.  **Use [Amazon DevOps Guru](https://aws.amazon.com/devops-guru/):** DevOps Guru uses data from X-Ray, CloudWatch, AWS Config, and AWS CloudTrail to provide actionable recommendations. 

1.  **Analyze traces:** Regularly review the trace data to discern patterns, anomalies, or bottlenecks that might impact your application's performance. 

1.  **Set up alerts:** Configure alarms in [CloudWatch](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/) for unusual patterns or extended latencies, allowing proactive issue addressing. 

1.  **Continuous improvement:** Revisit your tracing strategy as services are added or modified to capture all relevant data points. 

 **Level of effort for the implementation plan:** Medium
