# OPS08-BP05 Create dashboards

Dashboards are the human-centric view into the telemetry data of
your workloads. While they provide a vital visual interface, they
should not replace alerting mechanisms, but complement them. When
crafted with care, not only can they offer rapid insights into
system health and performance, but they can also present
stakeholders with real-time information on business outcomes and the
impact of issues.

**Desired outcome:**

Clear, actionable insights into system and business health using
visual representations.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- Overcomplicating dashboards with too many metrics.
- Relying on dashboards without alerts for anomaly detection.
- Not updating dashboards as workloads evolve.

**Benefits of this best practice:**

- Immediate visibility into critical system metrics and KPIs.
- Enhanced stakeholder communication and understanding.
- Rapid insight into the impact of operational issues.

**Level of risk if this best practice isn't
established:** Medium

## Implementation guidance

**Business-centric dashboards**

Dashboards tailored to business KPIs engage a wider array of
stakeholders. While these individuals might not be interested in
system metrics, they are keen on understanding the business
implications of these numbers. A business-centric dashboard
ensures that all technical and operational metrics being monitored
and analyzed are in sync with overarching business goals. This
alignment provides clarity, ensuring everyone is on the same page
regarding what's essential and what's not. Additionally,
dashboards that highlight business KPIs tend to be more
actionable. Stakeholders can quickly understand the health of
operations, areas that need attention, and the potential impact on
business outcomes.

With this in mind, when creating your dashboards, ensure that
there's a balance between technical metrics and business KPIs.
Both are vital, but they cater to different audiences. Ideally,
you should have dashboards that provide a holistic view of the
system's health and performance while also emphasizing key
business outcomes and their implications.

Amazon CloudWatch Dashboards are customizable home pages in the
CloudWatch console that you can use to monitor your resources in a
single view, even those resources that are spread across different
AWS Regions and accounts.

### Implementation steps

1. **Create a basic dashboard:**
   [Create
   a new dashboard in CloudWatch](../../../AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/create_dashboard.md "../../../AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/create_dashboard.md"), giving it a
   descriptive name.
2. **Use Markdown widgets:**
   Before diving into the metrics,
   [use
   Markdown widgets](../../../AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/add_remove_text_dashboard.md "../../../AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/add_remove_text_dashboard.md") to add textual context at the top of
   your dashboard. This should explain what the dashboard
   covers, the significance of the represented metrics, and can
   also contain links to other dashboards and troubleshooting
   tools.
3. **Create dashboard
   variables:**
   [Incorporate
   dashboard variables](../../../AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/cloudwatch_dashboard_variables.md "../../../AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/cloudwatch_dashboard_variables.md") where appropriate to allow for
   dynamic and flexible dashboard views.
4. **Create metrics widgets:**
   [Add
   metric widgets](../../../AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/create-and-work-with-widgets.md "../../../AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/create-and-work-with-widgets.md") to visualize various metrics your
   application emits, tailoring these widgets to effectively
   represent system health and business outcomes.
5. **Log Insights queries:**
   Utilize
   [CloudWatch
   Log Insights](../../../AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/CWL_ExportQueryResults.md "../../../AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/CWL_ExportQueryResults.md") to derive actionable metrics from your
   logs and display these insights on your dashboard.
6. **Set up alarms:** Integrate
   [CloudWatch
   Alarms](../../../AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/add_remove_alarm_dashboard.md "../../../AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/add_remove_alarm_dashboard.md") into your dashboard for a quick view of any
   metrics breaching their thresholds.
7. **Use Contributor Insights:**
   Incorporate
   [CloudWatch
   Contributor Insights](../../../AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/ContributorInsights-ViewReports.md "../../../AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/ContributorInsights-ViewReports.md") to analyze high-cardinality
   fields and get a clearer understanding of your resource's
   top contributors.
8. **Design custom widgets:**
   For specific needs not met by standard widgets, consider
   creating
   [custom
   widgets](../../../AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/add_custom_widget_dashboard.md "../../../AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/add_custom_widget_dashboard.md"). These can pull from various data sources or
   represent data in unique ways.
9. **Use AWS Health:** AWS Health is the authoritative source of information about the health of your AWS Cloud resources. Use [AWS Health Dashboard](https://health.aws.amazon.com/health/status "https://health.aws.amazon.com/health/status") out of the box, or use AWS Health data in your own dashboards and tools so you have the right information available to make informed decisions.
10. **Iterate and refine:** As
    your application evolves, regularly revisit your dashboard
    to ensure its relevance.
