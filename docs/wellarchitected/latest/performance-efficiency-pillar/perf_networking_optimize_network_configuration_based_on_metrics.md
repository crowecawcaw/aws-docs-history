<a name="perf_networking_optimize_network_configuration_based_on_metrics"></a>

 Use collected and analyzed data to make informed decisions about optimizing your network configuration. 

 **Common anti-patterns:** 
+  You assume that all performance-related issues are application-related. 
+  You only test your network performance from a location close to where you have deployed the workload. 
+  You use default configurations for all network services. 
+  You overprovision the network resource to provide sufficient capacity. 

 **Benefits of establishing this best practice:** Collecting necessary metrics of your AWS network and implementing network monitoring tools allows you to understand network performance and optimize network configurations. 

 **Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established:** Low 

## Implementation guidance
<a name="implementation-guidance"></a>

 Monitoring traffic to and from VPCs, subnets, or network interfaces is crucial to understand how to utilize AWS network resources and optimize network configurations. By using the following AWS networking tools, you can further inspect information about the traffic usage, network access and logs. 

### Implementation steps

+  Identify the key performance metrics such as latency or packet loss to collect. AWS provides several tools that can help you to collect these metrics. By using the following tools, you can further inspect information about the traffic usage, network access, and logs:     
[See the AWS documentation website for more details](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/performance-efficiency-pillar/perf_networking_optimize_network_configuration_based_on_metrics.html)
+  Identify top talkers and application traffic patterns using VPC and AWS Transit Gateway Flow Logs. 
+  Assess and optimize your current network architecture including VPCs, subnets, and routing. As an example, you can evaluate how different VPC peering or AWS Transit Gateway can help you improve the networking in your architecture. 
+  Assess the routing paths in your network to verify that the shortest path between destinations is always used. Network Access Analyzer can help you do this.
