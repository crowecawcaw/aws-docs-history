# ADVSUS03-BP01 Use caching techniques to prevent frequent data access

Implement caching techniques to store frequently accessed data in
cache, preventing repeated data retrieval and thereby reducing
computing time and energy consumption for advertising workloads.

## Implementation guidance

- Implement caching strategies for advertising content and
  data to minimize frequent data access and reduce computing
  time and energy consumption.
- Use AWS caching services like
  [Amazon ElastiCache](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticache/ "https://aws.amazon.com/elasticache/") (for in-memory caching) and
  [Amazon CloudFront](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/ "https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/") (for content delivery network caching) to
  store frequently accessed data closer to the consumers,
  reducing latency and compute requirements.
- Consider using
  [AWS Lambda@Edge](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/edge/ "https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/edge/") and CloudFront Functions to run
  lightweight logic at edge locations, minimizing the need for
  data transfer to centralized servers and reducing overall
  energy consumption.

## Key AWS services

- [AWS Global Accelerator](https://aws.amazon.com/global-accelerator/ "https://aws.amazon.com/global-accelerator/") (for optimizing data transfer over
  the AWS Cloud)
- [AWS Graviton processors](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/graviton/ "https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/graviton/") (for energy-efficient compute
  instances)
