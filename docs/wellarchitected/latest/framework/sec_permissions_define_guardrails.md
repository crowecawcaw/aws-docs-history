# SEC03-BP05 Define permission guardrails for

your organization

Use permission guardrails to reduce the scope of available
permissions that can be granted to principals. The permission policy
evaluation chain includes your guardrails to determine the
_effective permissions_ of a principal when
making authorization decisions.  You can define guardrails using a
layer-based approach. Apply some guardrails broadly across your
entire organization and apply others granularly to temporary access
sessions.

**Desired outcome:** You have clear
isolation of environments using separate AWS accounts.  Service
control policies (SCPs) are used to define organization-wide
permission guardrails. Broader guardrails are set at the hierarchy
levels closest to your organization root, and more strict guardrails
are set closer to the level of individual accounts.

Where supported, resource policies define the conditions that a
principal must satisfy to gain access to a resource. Resource
policies also scope down the set of allowable actions, where
appropriate. Permission boundaries are placed on principals that
manage workload permissions, delegating permission management to
individual workload owners.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- Creating member AWS accounts within an
  [AWS Organization](https://aws.amazon.com/organizations/ "https://aws.amazon.com/organizations/"), but not using SCPs to restrict the use and
  permissions available to their root credentials.
- Assigning permissions based on least privilege, but not placing
  guardrails on the maximum set of permissions that can be
  granted.
- Relying on the *implicit deny* foundation of
  AWS IAM to restrict permissions, trusting that policies will not
  grant an undesired *explicit
  allow* permission.
- Running multiple workload environments in the same AWS account,
  and then relying on mechanisms such as VPCs, tags, or resource
  policies to enforce permission boundaries.

**Benefits of establishing this best
practice:** Permission guardrails help build confidence
that undesired permissions cannot be granted, even when a permission
policy attempts to do so.  This can simplify defining and managing
permissions by reducing the maximum scope of permissions needing
consideration.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** Medium

## Implementation guidance

We recommend you use a layer-based approach to define permission
guardrails for your organization. This approach systematically
reduces the maximum set of possible permissions as additional
layers are applied. This helps you grant access based on the
principle of least privilege, reducing the risk of unintended
access due to policy misconfiguration.

The first step to establish permission guardrails is to isolate
your workloads and environments into separate AWS accounts.
Principals from one account cannot access resources in another
account without explicit permission to do so, even when both
accounts are in the same AWS organization or under the same
[organizational
unit (OU)](../../../organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_ous.md "../../../organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_ous.md"). You can use OUs to group accounts you want to
administer as a single unit.   

The next step is to reduce the maximum set of permissions that you
can grant to principals within the member accounts of your
organization. You can
use [service
control policies (SCPs)](../../../organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_policies_scps.md "../../../organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_policies_scps.md") for this purpose, which you can
apply to either an OU or an account. SCPs can enforce common
access controls, such as restricting access to specific AWS Regions, help prevent resources from being deleted, or disabling
potentially risky service actions. SCPs that you apply to the root
of your organization only affect its member accounts, not the
management account.  SCPs only govern the principals within your
organization. Your SCPs don't govern principals outside your
organization that are accessing your resources.

If you are using
[AWS Control Tower](../../../controltower/latest/userguide/what-is-control-tower.md "../../../controltower/latest/userguide/what-is-control-tower.md"), you can leverage its
[controls](../../../controltower/latest/userguide/how-control-tower-works.md#how-controls-work "../../../controltower/latest/userguide/how-control-tower-works.md#how-controls-work")
and
[landing
zones](../../../controltower/latest/userguide/aws-multi-account-landing-zone.md "../../../controltower/latest/userguide/aws-multi-account-landing-zone.md") as the foundation for your permission guardrails and
multi-account environment. The landing zones provide a
pre-configured, secure baseline environment with separate accounts
for different workloads and applications. The guardrails enforce
mandatory controls around security, operations, and compliance
through a combination of Service Control Policies (SCPs), AWS Config rules, and other configurations. However, when using
Control Tower guardrails and landing zones alongside custom
Organization SCPs, it's crucial to follow the best practices
outlined in the AWS documentation to avoid conflicts and ensure
proper governance. Refer to the
[AWS Control Tower guidance for AWS Organizations](../../../controltower/latest/userguide/orgs-guidance.md "../../../controltower/latest/userguide/orgs-guidance.md") for detailed
recommendations on managing SCPs, accounts, and organizational
units (OUs) within a Control Tower environment.

By adhering to these guidelines, you can effectively leverage
Control Tower's guardrails, landing zones, and custom SCPs while
mitigating potential conflicts and ensuring proper governance and
control over your multi-account AWS environment.

A further step is to use
[IAM
resource policies](../../../IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.md#policies_resource-based "../../../IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.md#policies_resource-based") to scope the available actions that you
can take on the resources they govern, along with any conditions
that the acting principal must meet. This can be as broad as
allowing all actions so long as the principal is part of your
organization (using the
PrincipalOrgId [condition
key](../../../IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_condition-keys.md "../../../IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_condition-keys.md")), or as granular as only allowing specific actions by a
specific IAM role. You can take a similar approach with conditions
in IAM role trust policies.  If a resource or role trust policy
explicitly names a principal in the same account as the role or
resource it governs, that principal does not need an attached IAM
policy that grants the same permissions.  If the principal is in a
different account from the resource, then the principal does need
an attached IAM policy that grants those permissions.

Often, a workload team will want to manage the permissions their
workload requires.  This may require them to create new IAM roles
and permission policies.  You can capture the maximum scope of
permissions the team is allowed to grant in an
[IAM
permission boundary](../../../IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_boundaries.md "../../../IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_boundaries.md"), and associate this document to an IAM
role the team can then use to manage their IAM roles and
permissions.  This approach can provide them the flexibility to
complete their work while mitigating risks of having IAM
administrative access.

A more granular step is to implement _privileged access
management_ (PAM) and *temporary elevated
access management* (TEAM) techniques.  One example of
PAM is to require principals to perform multi-factor
authentication before taking privileged actions.  For more
information, see
[Configuring
MFA-protected API access](../../../IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_mfa_configure-api-require.md "../../../IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_mfa_configure-api-require.md"). TEAM requires a solution that
manages the approval and timeframe that a principal is allowed to
have elevated access.  One approach is to temporarily add the
principal to the role trust policy for an IAM role that has
elevated access.  Another approach is to, under normal operation,
scope down the permissions granted to a principal by an IAM role
using a
[session
policy](../../../IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.md#policies_session "../../../IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.md#policies_session"), and then temporarily lift this restriction during
the approved time window. To learn more about solutions that AWS
and select partners validated, see
[Temporary
elevated access](../../../singlesignon/latest/userguide/temporary-elevated-access.md "../../../singlesignon/latest/userguide/temporary-elevated-access.md").

### Implementation steps

1. Isolate your workloads and environments into separate AWS accounts.
2. Use SCPs to reduce the maximum set of permissions that can
   be granted to principals within the member accounts of your
   organization.
   1. When defining SCPs to reduce the maximum set of
      permissions that can be granted to principals within
      your organization's member accounts, you can choose
      between an _allow list_ or
      _deny list_ approach. The allow list
      strategy explicitly specifies the access that is allowed
      and implicitly blocks all other access. The deny list
      strategy explicitly specifies the access that isn't
      allowed and allows all other access by default. Both
      strategies have their advantages and trade-offs, and the
      appropriate choice depends on your organization's
      specific requirements and risk model. For more detail,
      see
      [Strategy
      for using SCPs](../../../organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_policies_scps_strategies.md "../../../organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_policies_scps_strategies.md").
   2. Additionally, review the
      [service
      control policy examples](../../../organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_policies_scps_examples.md "../../../organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_policies_scps_examples.md") to understand how to
      construct SCPs effectively.

3. Use IAM resource policies to scope down and specify
   conditions for permitted actions on resources.  Use
   conditions in IAM role trust policies to create restrictions
   on assuming roles.
4. Assign IAM permission boundaries to IAM roles that workload
   teams can then use to manage their own workload IAM roles
   and permissions.
5. Evaluate PAM and TEAM solutions based on your needs.
