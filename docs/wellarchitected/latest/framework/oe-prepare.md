# Prepare

To prepare for operational excellence, you have to understand your
workloads and their expected behaviors. You will then be able to
design them to provide insight to their status and build the
procedures to support them.

Design your workload so that it provides the information necessary
for you to understand its internal state (for example, metrics,
logs, events, and traces) across all
components in support of observability and investigating issues.
Observability goes beyond simple monitoring, providing a comprehensive understanding of a system's internal workings based on its external outputs. Rooted in metrics, logs, and traces, observability offers profound insights into system behavior and dynamics. With effective observability, teams can discern patterns, anomalies, and trends, allowing them to proactively address potential issues and maintain optimal system health. Identifying key performance indicators (KPIs) is pivotal to ensure alignment between monitoring activities and business objectives. This alignment ensures that teams are making data-driven decisions using metrics that genuinely matter, optimizing both system performance and business outcomes.
Furthermore, observability empowers businesses to be proactive rather than reactive. Teams can understand the cause-and-effect relationships within their systems, predicting and preventing issues rather than just reacting to them. As workloads evolve, it's essential to revisit and refine the observability strategy, ensuring it remains relevant and effective.

Adopt approaches that improve the ﬂow of changes into production
and that achieves refactoring, fast feedback on quality, and bug
fixing. These accelerate beneficial changes entering production,
limit issues deployed, and activate rapid identification and
remediation of issues introduced through deployment activities or
discovered in your environments.

Adopt approaches that provide fast feedback on quality and achieves
rapid recovery from changes that do not have desired outcomes.
Using these practices mitigates the impact of issues introduced
through the deployment of changes. Plan for unsuccessful changes
so that you are able to respond faster if necessary and test and
validate the changes you make. Be aware of planned activities in
your environments so that you can manage the risk of changes
impacting planned activities. Emphasize frequent, small,
reversible changes to limit the scope of change. This results in
faster troubleshooting and remediation with the option to
roll back a change. It also means you are able to get the benefit
of valuable changes more frequently.

Evaluate the operational readiness of your workload, processes,
procedures, and personnel to understand the operational risks
related to your workload. Use a consistent process
(including manual or automated checklists) to know when you are
ready to go live with your workload or a change. This will also
help you to find
any areas that you must make plans to address. Have runbooks
that document your routine activities and playbooks that guide
your processes for issue resolution. Understand the benefits and
risks to make informed decisions to permit changes to enter
production.

AWS allows you to view your entire workload (applications, infrastructure, policy,
governance, and operations) as code. This means you can apply the same engineering
discipline that you use for application code to every element of your stack and share
these across teams or organizations to magnify the benefits of development efforts. Use
operations as code in the cloud and the ability to safely experiment to develop your
workload, your operations procedures, and practice failure. Using AWS CloudFormation allows you to
have consistent, templated, sandbox development, test, and production environments with
increasing levels of operations control.

The following questions focus on these considerations for
operational excellence.

| OPS 4:  How do you implement observability in your workload?                                                                                 |

Invest in implementing operations activities as code to maximize
the productivity of operations personnel, minimize error rates,
and achieve automated responses. Use “pre-mortems” to anticipate
failure and create procedures where appropriate. Apply metadata
using Resource Tags and AWS Resource Groups following a consistent
tagging strategy to achieve identification of your resources. Tag
your resources for organization, cost accounting, access
controls, and targeting the running of automated operations
activities. Adopt deployment practices that take advantage of the
elasticity of the cloud to facilitate development activities,
and pre-deployment of systems for faster implementations. When you
make changes to the checklists you use to evaluate your
workloads, plan what you will do with live systems that no longer
comply.
