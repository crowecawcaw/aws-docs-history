# SUS03-BP01 Optimize software and architecture for asynchronous and scheduled jobs
<a name="sus_sus_software_a2"></a>

Use efficient software and architecture patterns such as queue-driven to maintain consistent high utilization of deployed resources.

 **Common anti-patterns:** 
+  You overprovision the resources in your cloud workload to meet unforeseen spikes in demand. 
+  Your architecture does not decouple senders and receivers of asynchronous messages by a messaging component. 

 **Benefits of establishing this best practice:** 
+  Efficient software and architecture patterns minimize the unused resources in your workload and improve the overall efficiency. 
+  You can scale the processing independently of the receiving of asynchronous messages. 
+  Through a messaging component, you have relaxed availability requirements that you can meet with fewer resources. 

 **Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established:** Medium 

## Implementation guidance
<a name="implementation-guidance"></a>

 Use efficient architecture patterns such as [event-driven architecture](https://aws.amazon.com/event-driven-architecture/) that result in even utilization of components and minimize overprovisioning in your workload. Using efficient architecture patterns minimizes idle resources from lack of use due to changes in demand over time. 

 Understand the requirements of your workload components and adopt architecture patterns that increase overall utilization of resources. Retire components that are no longer required. 

### Implementation steps
<a name="implementation-steps"></a>
+  Analyze the demand for your workload to determine how to respond to those. 
+  For requests or jobs that don’t require synchronous responses, use queue-driven architectures and auto scaling workers to maximize utilization. Here are some examples of when you might consider queue-driven architecture:     
[See the AWS documentation website for more details](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/sus_sus_software_a2.html)
+  For requests or jobs that can be processed anytime, use scheduling mechanisms to process jobs in batch for more efficiency. Here are some examples of scheduling mechanisms on AWS:     
[See the AWS documentation website for more details](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/sus_sus_software_a2.html)
+  If you use polling and webhooks mechanisms in your architecture, replace those with events. Use [event-driven architectures](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/operatorguide/event-driven-architectures.html) to build highly efficient workloads. 
+  Leverage [serverless on AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/) to eliminate over-provisioned infrastructure. 
+  Right size individual components of your architecture to prevent idling resources waiting for input. 
  +  You can use the [Rightsizing Recommendations in AWS Cost Explorer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cost-management/latest/userguide/ce-rightsizing.html) or [AWS Compute Optimizer](https://aws.amazon.com/compute-optimizer/) to identify rightsizing opportunities. 
  +  For more detail, see [Right Sizing: Provisioning Instances to Match Workloads](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/cost-optimization-right-sizing/cost-optimization-right-sizing.html).
