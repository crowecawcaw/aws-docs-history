# DevOps Guidance

Publication date: **September 20, 2023** ([Document history](document-revisions.md "document-revisions.md"))

Drawing from Amazon's own transformative journey and the expertise
gained by AWS in
managing cloud services at global scale, the AWS Well-Architected
Framework DevOps Guidance offers a structured approach that
organizations of all sizes can follow to cultivate a high-velocity,
security-focused culture capable of delivering substantial business
value using modern technologies and DevOps best practices.

## Introduction

In the early 2000s, Amazon went through its own DevOps
transformation which led to an online bookstore forming the Amazon Web Services
(AWS) cloud computing division. Today, AWS provides a
wide range of products and services for global customers that are
powered by that same innovative DevOps approach. Due to the
positive effects of this transformation, AWS recognizes the
significance of DevOps and has been at the forefront of its
adoption and implementation.

Amazon's own journey, along with the collective experience gained
from assisting customers as they modernize and migrate to the
cloud, provided insight into the capabilities which we believe
make DevOps adoption successful. With these learnings, we created
a collection of modern capabilities that together form a
comprehensive approach to designing, developing, securing, and
efficiently operating software at cloud scale.

The content and recommendations outlined within the Well-Architected DevOps Guidance are
based on our expertise operating and managing services for global customers and serves as a
customizable reference to fit your organization's requirements. Each organization has unique
requirements which may deviate from the examples provided here.

**There is no one-size-fits-all approach to adopting DevOps. Tailor
these recommendations to suit your individual environment, quality, and security
needs.**

## Definitions

- **DevOps Sagas** are core
  domains within the software delivery process that collectively
  form AWS DevOps best practices. Together, they form a
  collection of modern capabilities representing a comprehensive
  approach to designing, developing, securing, and efficiently
  operating software at cloud scale. You can use the DevOps
  Sagas as a common definition of what DevOps means to align on
  a shared understanding within your organization.
- **Capabilities** are repeatable
  mechanisms that an organization can continuously improve to
  sustainably practice DevOps and achieve measurable outcomes.
  Each capability includes best practice indicators, metrics,
  and anti-patterns that can be tracked and refined over time.
  Capabilities encompass a wide range of topics related to the
  associated DevOps Saga. They are not presented in any specific
  order.
- **Indicators** are a collective term covering best practices
  spanning people, process, and technology. They can be used as qualitative measurements,
  such as a checklist, to objectively assess and continuously track your organization's
  ability to perform a capability. Each indicator contains a prescriptive improvement plan
  that contains high-level guidance for performing it. Indicators can fall into one of three
  categories, which represent importance:
  - **Foundational:** Requirements to achieve minimum
    viability of the capability when practicing DevOps. Indicators in this category are
    considered essential for organizations to meet to achieve basic proficiency of the
    capability.
  - **Recommended:** Recommended best practices and advanced
    techniques that can improve the performance of the capability. Indicators in this
    category offer significant benefits, such as improved security, developer experience,
    speed, reliability, or the ability to optimize implementation in cloud-based
    environments.
  - **Optional:** Minor adjustments and improvements that
    further enhance the ability to implement the capability or apply only to specific use
    cases. Indicators in this category might not be applicable to all organizations or
    workloads, but can provide additional benefits to some.

- **Anti-patterns** are practices that might seem beneficial
  initially, but have the potential to lead to unexpected or negative outcomes. They are
  indicators that we have seen slow down or halt our customer's progress when adopting
  DevOps within their organizations. Identifying and addressing anti-patterns can help you
  to avoid pitfalls and optimize the chance for successful DevOps adoption.
- **Metrics** are quantifiable measures of an organization's
  ability to perform the associated capability. Think of indicators as the
  _how_ and metrics as the _how well_ when using
  this guidance to measure your organization's ability to implement a capability. There is
  no one-size-fits-all approach to selecting which metrics to track. We provide metrics for
  each capability as a starting point. Each organization needs to determine which metrics
  are important to their business. Consider using additional frameworks, such as [DevOps Research and Assessment (DORA)](https://dora.dev/ "https://dora.dev/") and [SPACE](https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=3454124 "https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=3454124"), to further customize
  the metrics we provide so that they align to your organizational goals.

_AWS Well-Architected Framework_ whitepaper.
