| HPCSEC02: How do you manage data encryption in your HPC cluster? | 
| --- |

 As described in the [Data Protection](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/data-protection.html) section, classifying and protecting data are foundational practices. The same foundational practices apply to the data related to your HPC workloads, and once the data is classified, there are a few additional HPC consideration for protecting it.

## HPCSEC02-BP01 Enforce encryption at rest in your HPC environment

 With [SEC08-BP01](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/sec_protect_data_rest_key_mgmt.html), you securely manage encryption keys to protect data at rest. You also tightly control access through the use of [key policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/key-policies.html) and IAM policies. AWS HPC products, such as AWS ParallelCluster, configure IAM permissions on different components, such as cluster, queues, and login nodes. Therefore, cluster users can unencrypt data at rest by IAM permissions associated with the cluster or component. If your HPC environment needs further isolation, such as by project or group separation, consider an architecture with multiple clusters for data separation by encryption key.

 When implementing [SEC09-BP02](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/sec_protect_data_transit_encrypt.html), you enforce encryption in transit. Tightly coupled HPC applications using EFA bypass the operating system kernel and directly communicate with the EFA device rather than traditional TCP/IP networking. This provides low-latency, reliable communication between cluster instances but introduces additional considerations when enforcing encryption in transit compared to traditional TCP/IP approaches. 

 AWS provides secure and private connectivity between EC2 instances of all types. In addition, some instance types use the offload capabilities of the underlying Nitro System hardware to automatically encrypt in-transit traffic between instances. This encryption uses Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data (AEAD) algorithms with 256-bit encryption, which also helps implement [SEC09-BP03](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/sec_protect_data_transit_authentication.html). There is no impact on network performance. 

 Therefore, your EFA traffic is automatically encrypted between cluster members with no impact to performance. This automatic encryption is also used with [FSx for Lustre](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/LustreGuide/encryption-in-transit-fsxl.html) and enforcing encryption in transit between cluster members and an FSx for Lustre filesystem. See [Encryption in transit](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/data-protection.html#encryption-transit) for additional details.
