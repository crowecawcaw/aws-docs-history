# Selecting eligible workers

By default, all tasks (HITs) posted to Amazon Mechanical Turk (Mechanical Turk) are available to all active
workers in the Mechanical Turk marketplace. You can restrict the audience that's eligible for your
HITs by adding qualification requirements. Qualification requirements can be used to
both restrict the audience to workers that meet certain criteria, or exclude those that
have certain attributes. These requirements operate on attributes that are assigned to
workers as _qualifications._ Qualifications can be assigned by the
Mechanical Turk system or requesters, and are visible to workers in their account.

## Qualifications and qualification types

Qualification types are system- or requester-defined descriptions of an attribute
that can be associated with a worker. One example is the system-generated
qualification type `NumberHITsApproved`, which measures the number of
HITs a worker has submitted and had approved. Another would be a requester-defined
qualification type that tracks how accurate a worker has been on previous tasks that
the requester has posted.

When a qualification type is assigned to a worker, it is applied as a
_qualification_ for that worker. In the case of the
system-generated `NumberHITsApproved` qualification type, a qualification
is automatically created for a worker as the work they submit is approved. For
custom qualification types, a requester can assign the qualification to a worker
using the [`AssociateQualificationWithWorker`](../AWSMturkAPI/ApiReference_AssociateQualificationWithWorkerOperation.md "../AWSMturkAPI/ApiReference_AssociateQualificationWithWorkerOperation.md") operation and
optionally providing an integer value to associate with it.

## Qualification requirements

A requirement is defined when calling either `CreateHIT` or
`CreateHITType`. Either operation accepts an array of one or more
[`QualificationRequirement`](../AWSMturkAPI/ApiReference_QualificationRequirementDataStructureArticle.md "../AWSMturkAPI/ApiReference_QualificationRequirementDataStructureArticle.md") data structures to specify
the qualifications workers must have to be eligible for your HIT.

The `QualificationRequirement` data structure comprises four
attributes: `QualificationTypeId`, `Comparator`, value (either
`IntegerValues` or `LocaleValues`), and
`ActionsGuarded`. The `QualificationTypeId` specifies the
qualification type that should be applied and can be either the ID of an Mechanical Turk system
qualification type, or one you create in your account. The `Comparator`
and value are then used to evaluate if the worker has the required qualification
attributes to be eligible for the HIT. Finally, the `ActionsGuarded`
indicates the level of visibility that a HIT has to workers that aren't eligible to
accept it.

The `Comparator` attribute specifies how the qualification type is
evaluated and is typically used with a value. The following table illustrates the
values that can be used for `Comparator` and the required value
attribute, if any. The existence `Comparators` don't require a value
attribute since they are only used to evaluate if the qualification type has been
assigned, not the value that has been associated with it.

| Type        | Values                 | Required value attribute          | Example                                                                                                                         |
| ----------- | ---------------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Existence   | `Exists`               | None                              | Only include workers that have been assigned the qualification<br>type, regardless of value.                                    |
| ​           | `DoesNotExist`         | None                              | Exclude workers that have been assigned the qualification type.                                                                 |
| Numeric     | `LessThan`             | `IntegerValues`                   | Only include workers that have been assigned the qualification<br>type where the assigned value is less than 50.                |
| ​           | `LessThanOrEqualTo`    | `IntegerValues`                   | Only include workers that have been assigned the qualification<br>type where the assigned value is less than or equal to 50.    |
| ​           | `GreaterThan`          | `IntegerValues`                   | Only include Workers that have been assigned the Qualification<br>Type where the assigned value is greater than 50.             |
| ​           | `GreaterThanOrEqualTo` | `IntegerValues`                   | Only include workers that have been assigned the qualification<br>type where the assigned value is greater than or equal to 50. |
| Equivalence | `EqualTo`              | `IntegerValues` or `LocaleValues` | Only include workers located in Spain.                                                                                          |
| ​           | `NotEqualTo`           | `IntegerValues` or `LocaleValues` | Only include workers who have been assigned the qualification<br>type where the assigned value is not 42.                       |
| Set         | `In`                   | `IntegerValues` or `LocaleValues` | Only include workers who have been assigned the qualification<br>type where the assigned value is 1, 2, 3 or 8.                 |
| ​           | `NotIn`                | `IntegerValues` or `LocaleValues` | Only include workers who are not located in the US States of<br>Florida and Georgia.                                            |

​

The `ActionsGuarded` attribute indicates the level of visibility that
your HIT has to workers who aren't eligible for it. This defaults to
`Accept`, which indicates that ineligible workers can't accept it,
but they can see it in the Mechanical Turk marketplace and preview the task if they wish so
that they can request a qualification to work on the HIT if they wish to. If you
want to prevent them from previewing it, you can set the `ActionsGuarded`
to `PreviewAndAccept`; they can then see it in their list of available
tasks and request any custom qualifications. Finally,
`DiscoverPreviewAndAccept` hides the HIT from ineligible workers.

The `CreateHIT` and `CreateHITType` operations accept an
array of qualification requirements which can include one or more qualification
requirement data structures so you cano apply multiple requirements to workers to be
eligible for your task. Because workers must meet _all_ of the
requirements, be careful to ensure that the requirements do not conflict. For
example, if you had a qualification requirement that specified workers must be
located in the US and a second requirement that they be located in canada, it would
be impossible for any worker to meet both criteria. If your goal is to include
workers in either the US or Canada, you would need replace the two requirements with
a single requirement using the _`In`_
`Comparator` to restrict workers to those in an array containing both the
US and Canada.

## System qualification types

The most commonly used qualification types are those provided by Mechanical Turk. These
include the following:

- A _HITs approved_ qualification for the
  number of HITs that workers have successfully completed in the past, which
  can be used to identify workers with more or less experience.
- An _Approval Percentage_ qualification to
  specify workers that you have approved at a specified rate on previous
  tasks.
- A _Locale_ qualification to select
  workers in specific countries or US states.
- A _Masters_ qualification that is awarded
  to workers that have demonstrated superior performance over a period of time
  across thousands of HITs.
- An _Adult_ qualification that selects
  workers who have indicated they are over 18 years of age and are willing to
  work on potentially offensive content.

Each of these qualification types has an associated
`QualificationTypeId` which can be found in the documentation for
[`QualificationRequirement`](../AWSMturkAPI/ApiReference_QualificationRequirementDataStructureArticle.md#ApiReference_QualificationType-IDs "../AWSMturkAPI/ApiReference_QualificationRequirementDataStructureArticle.md#ApiReference_QualificationType-IDs").

### Using the HITs Approved qualification

type

The `NumberHITsApproved` qualification type restricts tasks to
workers with more or less experience based on their past work on Mechanical Turk.  For
example, if you only wanted to use workers who were relatively new to the
platform and had successfully submitted fewer than 500 HITs, you would use the
following value for `QualificationRequirements`.

```

QualificationRequirements: [
  {
    QualificationTypeId: '00000000000000000040',
    Comparator: 'LessThan',
    IntegerValues: [500]
  }
]

```

If, instead, you wanted more experienced workers who had successfully
completed 100 HITs, you would use the following.

```

QualificationRequirements: [
  {
    QualificationTypeId: '00000000000000000040',
    Comparator: ' GreaterThanOrEqualTo',
    IntegerValues: [100]
  }
]

```

### Using the Masters qualification type

The Masters qualification type is a Mechanical Turk–managed qualification type
that is assigned to workers when they have demonstrated superior performance
over a period of time across thousands of HITs. There is no value associated
with it, so you can simply use the `Exists` comparator to apply it to
your tasks.

Note that there is an additional fee for using the Masters qualification on
your task as described in [Mechanical Turk
Pricing](https://www.mturk.com/pricing "https://www.mturk.com/pricing").

```

QualificationRequirements: [
  {
    QualificationTypeId: '2F1QJWKUDD8XADTFD2Q0G6UTO95ALH',
    Comparator: 'Exists'
  }
]

```

### Using the Percentage Approved

type

The `PercentAssignmentsApproved` qualification type restricts tasks
based on how often you have approved or rejected past work a worker has done for
you. For example, to only accept workers that have an approval rate of greater
than or equal to 95%, the following qualification requirement would be included
in your [`CreateHIT`](../AWSMturkAPI/ApiReference_CreateHITOperation.md "../AWSMturkAPI/ApiReference_CreateHITOperation.md") calls.

```

QualificationRequirements: [
  {
    QualificationTypeId: '000000000000000000L0',
    Comparator: 'GreaterThanOrEqualTo',
    IntegerValues: [95]
  }
]

```

Note that a worker's approval rate is statistically meaningless for small
numbers of assignments, since a single rejection can reduce the approval rate by
many percentage points. To ensure that a new worker's approval rate is
unaffected by these statistically meaningless changes, if a worker has submitted
fewer than 100 assignments for you, the worker's approval rate is 100%.

### Using the Locale qualification

type

Locale is a Mechanical Turk qualification type that specifies the workers that are
eligible for your task based on where they are located. To use Locale, you must
specify one or more `LocaleValues` using a JSON data structure that
includes a `Country` attribute and can optionally include a
`Subdivision` attribute. The `Country` attribute
should specify the two-character country code of the country. The
`Subdivision` attribute is only supported when the
`Country` is "US" and should specify the two-character
state code for the US state. The following example would restrict workers to
those in the US state of Minnesota.

```

QualificationRequirements: [
  {
    QualificationTypeId: '00000000000000000071',
    Comparator: 'EqualTo',
    LocaleValues: [
      {
          Country: "US",
          Subdivision: "MN"
     }
    ]
  }
]
 
```

To select multiple locations, you should use the `In` comparator
and a list of locales as shown in the following example, which restricts the
task to workers in the US and Canada.

```

QualificationRequirements: [
  {
    QualificationTypeId: '00000000000000000071',
    Comparator: 'In',
    LocaleValues: [
      { Country: "US" },
      { Country: "CA" }
    ]
  }
]
 
```

Use caution when using multiple Locale qualification requirements in the same
HIT. If the requirements above were split into two requirements, one for the US
and one for CA, no norkers could accept the task. However, using two Locale
requirements is a good way to restrict workers to the US but exclude selected
states. The following would include all workers in the US with the exception of
workers in Florida and Georgia.

```

QualificationRequirements: [
  {
    QualificationTypeId: '00000000000000000071',
    Comparator: 'Equals,
    LocaleValues: [
      { Country: "US" }
    ]
  },
  {
    QualificationTypeId: '00000000000000000071',
    Comparator: 'NotIn,
    LocaleValues: [
      { Country: "US", Subdivision: 'FL'},
      { Country: "US", Subdivision: 'GA'}
    ]
  }
]
 
```

### Objectionable content

Some tasks, such as image moderation, involve handling content that some
workers might find objectionable, typically because it involves imagery that
contains violence or nudity. If there is the potential that some of your HITs
may contain objectionable content, you should make use of the Adult
qualification type. This restricts the task to workers who have confirmed they
are over 18 years of age and are willing to view potentially objectionable
content. The qualification requirement should also specify an
`ActionsGuarded` value of `PreviewAndAccept` or
`DiscoverPreviewAndAccept`.

```

QualificationRequirements: [
  {
    QualificationTypeId: '00000000000000000060',
    Comparator: 'Equals',
    IntegerValues: [1],
    ActionsGuarded: 'PreviewAndAccept'
  }
]
 
```

In addition, you should include "(WARNING: This HIT may contain adult
content. Worker discretion is advised.)" in the title of your HIT.

### Custom qualification type

Requester-defined qualification types can also be created to handle a range of
needs in managing who can work on your tasks. Information on how to create and
use custom qualification types can be found in [Working with custom qualification types](WorkWithCustomQualType.md "WorkWithCustomQualType.md").
