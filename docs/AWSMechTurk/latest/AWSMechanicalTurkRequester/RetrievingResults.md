# Retrieving results

Retrieving the results of a HIT involves gathering the responses from each of the
assignment submissions provided by workers. At any point in a HIT's lifecycle (before it is
disposed) you can call the [`ListAssignmentsForHIT`](../AWSMturkAPI/ApiReference_ListAssignmentsForHITOperation.md "../AWSMturkAPI/ApiReference_ListAssignmentsForHITOperation.md") operation to retrieve all of assignments
that have been submitted and the answers provided by workers. If the some of the assignments
are still awaiting submission by workers, you receive partial results containing the
assignments have been submitted so far.

## Assignment attributes

The `ListAssignmentsForHIT` operation returns an array of zero or more
assignments, each captured in an [`Assignment`](../AWSMturkAPI/ApiReference_AssignmentDataStructureArticle.md "../AWSMturkAPI/ApiReference_AssignmentDataStructureArticle.md") data structure. The following example shows the
data structure that is returned. Each assignment includes the ID of the HIT with which
it's associated, the worker who submitted it, and the ID of the assignment itself. The
`AssignmentStatus` is one of `Submitted`,
`Approved`, or `Rejected`. When a worker first submits an
assignment, the status is `Submitted`, and changes based on your decision to
approve or reject the assignment.

```

{
     AssignmentId: "123RVWYBAZW00EXAMPLE456RVWYBAZW00EXAMPLE",
     WorkerId:"AZ3456EXAMPLE",
     HITId:"123RVWYBAZW00EXAMPLE",
     AssignmentStatus:"Submitted",
     AcceptTime: "2019-12-01T12:00:00Z",
     SubmitTime: "2019-12-01T13:04:59Z",
     AutoApprovalTime: "2019-12-04T13:04:59Z",
     Answer:'...'
  }
 

```

The `AcceptTime` and `SubmitTime` indicate when a worker first
accepted the task and when they submitted it. This can be used to infer a rough
approximation of how long it took the worker to complete the task; however, keep in mind
that a worker may step away from their computer for a period of time after accepting a
task so the time delta may be inflated.

The `AutoApprovalTime` indicates when the assignment will be automatically
approved if you don't approve or reject it yourself. This is computed by adding the
auto-approval delay you set when creating the HIT to the `SubmitTime`.

## Assignment answer

The `Answer` value is returned as a string containing a [`QuestionFormAnswers`](../AWSMturkAPI/ApiReference_QuestionFormAnswersDataStructureArticle.md "../AWSMturkAPI/ApiReference_QuestionFormAnswersDataStructureArticle.md") XML data structure. The layout of this
data structure corresponds to the HTML form fields you provided in your question HTML.
For example, consider the following task form using a standard HTML form element and
form field.

```

<form method='post' id='mturk_form' action='https://www.mturk.com/mturk/externalSubmit'>
  <p>What country do you live in?</p>
  <p><input type="text" name="country"></p>
  <p>Describe the current weather where you live</p>
  <p><textarea name="weather" cols="80" rows="3"></textarea></p>
  <p><input type="submit" id="submitButton" class="btn btn-primary" value="Submit"/></p>
</form>
 

```

The `QuestionFormAnswers` data structure contains an `Answer`
value for each form field in your HTML. The `QuestionIdentifier` is the name
supplied for the form field in your HTML and the `FreeText` attribute is the
value that was entered in the field by the worker. Here the
`QuestionIdentifier` values `country` and `weather`
match the names specified in the form definition. The `FreeText` values
contain the worker's responses.

```

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="ASCII"?>
<QuestionFormAnswers xmlns="http://mechanicalturk.amazonaws.com/AWSMechanicalTurkDataSchemas/2005-10-01/QuestionFormAnswers.xsd">
  <Answer>
    <QuestionIdentifier>country</QuestionIdentifier>
    <FreeText>United States</FreeText>
  </Answer>
  <Answer>
    <QuestionIdentifier>weather</QuestionIdentifier>
    <FreeText>It's currently raining lightly</FreeText>
  </Answer>
</QuestionFormAnswers>
 

```

**Assignment Answer when using crowd-form**

The structure of the answers returned in the `QuestionFormAnswer` data
structure is slightly different when using the `crowd-form` element from the
Crowd HTML Elements library. Consider the following example that mirrors the preceding
one, but replaces `form` with `crowd-form`.

```

<crowd-form>
  <p>What country do you live in?</p>
  <p><input type="text" name="country"></p>
  <p>Describe the current weather where you live</p>
  <p><textarea name="weather" cols="80" rows="3"></textarea></p>
</ crowd-form>
 

```

The `crowd-form` element collapses all of the form field values into a
single `Answer` value in the `QuestionFormAnswer` data structure
as shown in the following example. This answer always has the identifier
_taskAnswers_ and the `FreeText` value is an array of
JSON key-value pairs containing the worker answers.

```

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="ASCII"?>
<QuestionFormAnswers xmlns="http://mechanicalturk.amazonaws.com/AWSMechanicalTurkDataSchemas/2005-10-01/QuestionFormAnswers.xsd">
  <Answer>
    <QuestionIdentifier>taskAnswers</QuestionIdentifier>
    <FreeText>
      [
        {
          "country": "United States",
          "weather": "It's currently raining lightly"
        }
      ]
    </FreeText>
  </Answer>
</QuestionFormAnswers>
 

```
