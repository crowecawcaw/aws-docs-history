# HIT attributes

When you create a task (HIT) with Amazon Mechanical Turk (Mechanical Turk), you provide a number of attributes
about the task that tell Mechanical Turk how to display it in the marketplace. These are separate from
the content and question of the task itself, and include the title, description, reward
amount, and attributes describing how long the task will remain active.

The attributes can be grouped as follows.

**Descriptive attributes**

- `Title`
- `Description`
- `Keywords`
  **Reward time-related attributes**

- `AssignmentDurationInSeconds`
- `AutoApprovalDelayInSeconds`
- `LifetimeInSeconds`
  **`MaxAssignments`
  `QualificationRequirements`**

The first six attributes (`Title`, `Description`,
`Keywords`, `Reward`, `AssignmentDurationInSeconds`, and
`AutoApprovalDelayInSeconds`) and `QualificationRequirements` comprise
the _HIT Type_ for the task. The HIT Type attributes are common across a
group of HITs and allow the Mechanical Turk marketplace to group tasks together that have the same HIT
Type. When workers complete a task, they can immediately start on the next task with the same
HIT Type.

When you call the `CreateHIT` API and provide these values, Mechanical Turk first attempts to find an
existing HIT Type that has the same values for these attributes. If one doesn't exist, then a
new HIT Type is created. Alternatively, you can call [`CreateHITType`](../AWSMturkAPI/ApiReference_CreateHITTypeOperation.md "../AWSMturkAPI/ApiReference_CreateHITTypeOperation.md") with these attributes to directly create a HIT Type
and then use the resulting HIT Type ID to create HITs using the [`CreateHITWithHITType`](../AWSMturkAPI/ApiReference_CreateHITWithHITTypeOperation.md "../AWSMturkAPI/ApiReference_CreateHITWithHITTypeOperation.md") API.

**`Title`, `Description`, and `Keywords`**

These should provide a clear description of the task to be completed, as well as any
relevant search keywords that help workers find your task.

**`Reward`**

The amount that is transferred to the worker when the task is approved. This is in US
dollars and should be provided to the API as a string. For example, to set the reward for a
HIT at 10 cents, the value would be "0.10".

`**AssignmentDurationInSeconds**`

`AssignmentDurationInSeconds` is the amount of time that workers have to
complete the task. For example, if you create a HIT that has an
`AssignmentDurationInSeconds` of 300 it expires after 5 minutes. If a worker does
not complete it in that time, it is be assigned to a new worker.

You should specify a duration that is long enough that a worker can still complete it even
if they run into difficulties. However, don't set it to be overly long, as this can result in
an assignment becoming orphaned for the duration of the time. Setting a long assignment
duration can also discourage workers from accepting it if workers believe the amount of time
required is significantly out of line with the reward amount.

**Auto-approval delay**

After a worker submits an aAssignment, you have the option to _approve_
or _reject_ their work. However, if the amount of time specified by the
`AutoApprovalDelayInSeconds` elapses, then it is automatically approved. Timely
approval or rejection of worker submissions is important to workers as it directly influences
how quickly they get paid for the tasks they complete. As such, you should strive to review
work shortly after it is submitted and set the auto-approval delay as low as possible so that
workers don't have to wait inordinately long if you fail to approve some assignments. To
automatically approve all work that is submitted, you can set the auto-approval delay to 0.

**Lifetime**

`LifetimeInSeconds` is the maximum amount of time that a HIT is available to be
accepted in the Mechanical Turk marketplace. If the lifetime expires before all of the available
assignments have been accepted, it is removed from the marketplace. Note that if the lifetime
expires after a worker accepts an assignment, the worker can still submit a response up until
the assignment duration expires.

**Max Assignments**

`MaxAssignments` specifies the maximum number of workers that can submit
responses for a HIT.

**Qualification Requirements**

`QualificationRequirements` can be used to manage which workers can view and
accept a HIT. More information on using qualification requirements can be found in [Managing workers](ManagingWorkers.md "ManagingWorkers.md").
