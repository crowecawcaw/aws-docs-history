# UploadPart

Uploads a part in a multipart upload.

###### Note

In this operation, you provide new data as a part of an object in your request. However, you have
 an option to specify your existing Amazon S3 object as a data source for the part you are uploading. To
 upload a part from an existing object, you use the [UploadPartCopy](API_UploadPartCopy.md "API_UploadPartCopy.md") operation. 

You must initiate a multipart upload (see [CreateMultipartUpload](API_CreateMultipartUpload.md "API_CreateMultipartUpload.md")) before you can
 upload any part. In response to your initiate request, Amazon S3 returns an upload ID, a unique identifier
 that you must include in your upload part request.

Part numbers can be any number from 1 to 10,000, inclusive. A part number uniquely identifies a part
 and also defines its position within the object being created. If you upload a new part using the same
 part number that was used with a previous part, the previously uploaded part is overwritten.

For information about maximum and minimum part sizes and other multipart upload specifications, see
 [Multipart upload
 limits](../userguide/qfacts.md "../userguide/qfacts.md") in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

###### Note

After you initiate multipart upload and upload one or more parts, you must either complete or
 abort multipart upload in order to stop getting charged for storage of the uploaded parts. Only after
 you either complete or abort multipart upload, Amazon S3 frees up the parts storage and stops charging you
 for the parts storage.

For more information on multipart uploads, go to [Multipart Upload Overview](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/mpuoverview.html "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/mpuoverview.html") in the
 *Amazon S3 User Guide* .

###### Note


**Directory buckets** - For directory buckets, you must make requests for this API operation to the Zonal endpoint. These endpoints support virtual-hosted-style requests in the format `https://*amzn-s3-demo-bucket*.s3express-*zone-id*.*region-code*.amazonaws.com/*key-name*`. Path-style requests are not supported. For more information about endpoints in Availability Zones, see [Regional and Zonal endpoints for directory buckets in Availability Zones](../userguide/endpoint-directory-buckets-AZ.md "../userguide/endpoint-directory-buckets-AZ.md") in the
 *Amazon S3 User Guide*. For more information about endpoints in Local Zones, see [Concepts for directory buckets in Local Zones](../userguide/s3-lzs-for-directory-buckets.md "../userguide/s3-lzs-for-directory-buckets.md") in the
 *Amazon S3 User Guide*.



Permissions


* **General purpose bucket permissions** - To perform a
 multipart upload with encryption using an AWS Key Management Service key, the requester must have permission to
 the `kms:Decrypt` and `kms:GenerateDataKey` actions on the key. The
 requester must also have permissions for the `kms:GenerateDataKey` action for the
 `CreateMultipartUpload` API. Then, the requester needs permissions for the
 `kms:Decrypt` action on the `UploadPart` and
 `UploadPartCopy` APIs.


These permissions are required because Amazon S3 must decrypt and read data from the encrypted
 file parts before it completes the multipart upload. For more information about KMS
 permissions, see [Protecting data using server-side
 encryption with AWS KMS](../userguide/UsingKMSEncryption.md "../userguide/UsingKMSEncryption.md") in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*. For information
 about the permissions required to use the multipart upload API, see [Multipart upload and
 permissions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/mpuAndPermissions.html "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/mpuAndPermissions.html") and [Multipart upload API and
 permissions](../userguide/mpuoverview.md#mpuAndPermissions "../userguide/mpuoverview.md#mpuAndPermissions") in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.
* **Directory bucket permissions** - To grant access to this API operation on a directory bucket, we recommend that you use the [`CreateSession`](API_CreateSession.md "API_CreateSession.md") API operation for session-based authorization. Specifically, you grant the `s3express:CreateSession` permission to the directory bucket in a bucket policy or an IAM identity-based policy. Then, you make the `CreateSession` API call on the bucket to obtain a session token. With the session token in your request header, you can make API requests to this operation. After the session token expires, you make another `CreateSession` API call to generate a new session token for use. 
AWS CLI or SDKs create session and refresh the session token automatically to avoid service interruptions when a session expires. For more information about authorization, see [`CreateSession`](API_CreateSession.md "API_CreateSession.md").


If the object is encrypted with SSE-KMS, you must also have the
 `kms:GenerateDataKey` and `kms:Decrypt` permissions in IAM
 identity-based policies and AWS KMS key policies for the AWS KMS key.


Data integrity


**General purpose bucket** - To ensure that data is not corrupted
 traversing the network, specify the `Content-MD5` header in the upload part request.
 Amazon S3 checks the part data against the provided MD5 value. If they do not match, Amazon S3 returns an
 error. If the upload request is signed with Signature Version 4, then AWS S3 uses the
 `x-amz-content-sha256` header as a checksum instead of `Content-MD5`. For
 more information see [Authenticating Requests:
 Using the Authorization Header (AWS Signature Version 4)](sigv4-auth-using-authorization-header.md "sigv4-auth-using-authorization-header.md"). 


###### Note


**Directory buckets** - MD5 is not supported by directory buckets. You can use checksum algorithms to check object integrity.



Encryption


* **General purpose bucket** - Server-side encryption is for
 data encryption at rest. Amazon S3 encrypts your data as it writes it to disks in its data centers
 and decrypts it when you access it. You have mutually exclusive options to protect data using
 server-side encryption in Amazon S3, depending on how you choose to manage the encryption keys.
 Specifically, the encryption key options are Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3), AWS KMS keys
 (SSE-KMS), and Customer-Provided Keys (SSE-C). Amazon S3 encrypts data with server-side encryption
 using Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3) by default. You can optionally tell Amazon S3 to encrypt data at
 rest using server-side encryption with other key options. The option you use depends on
 whether you want to use KMS keys (SSE-KMS) or provide your own encryption key
 (SSE-C).


Server-side encryption is supported by the S3 Multipart Upload operations. Unless you are
 using a customer-provided encryption key (SSE-C), you don't need to specify the encryption
 parameters in each UploadPart request. Instead, you only need to specify the server-side
 encryption parameters in the initial Initiate Multipart request. For more information, see
 [CreateMultipartUpload](API_CreateMultipartUpload.md "API_CreateMultipartUpload.md").


If you request server-side encryption using a customer-provided encryption key (SSE-C) in
 your initiate multipart upload request, you must provide identical encryption information in
 each part upload using the following request headers.




	+ x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm
	+ x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key
	+ x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key-MD5
 For more information, see [Using Server-Side
 Encryption](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingServerSideEncryption.html "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingServerSideEncryption.html") in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.
* **Directory buckets**  -
 For directory buckets, there are only two supported options for server-side encryption: server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3) (`AES256`) and server-side encryption with AWS KMS keys (SSE-KMS) (`aws:kms`).


Special errors

## URI Request Parameters


The request uses the following URI parameters.





**[Bucket](#API_UploadPart_RequestSyntax "#API_UploadPart_RequestSyntax")**


The name of the bucket to which the multipart upload was initiated.



**Directory buckets** - When you use this operation with a directory bucket, you must use virtual-hosted-style requests in the format `*Bucket-name*.s3express-*zone-id*.*region-code*.amazonaws.com`. Path-style requests are not supported. Directory bucket names must be unique in the chosen Zone (Availability Zone or Local Zone). Bucket names must follow the format `*bucket-base-name*--*zone-id*--x-s3` (for example, `*amzn-s3-demo-bucket*--*usw2-az1*--x-s3`). For information about bucket naming
 restrictions, see [Directory bucket naming
 rules](../userguide/directory-bucket-naming-rules.md "../userguide/directory-bucket-naming-rules.md") in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.



**Access points** - When you use this action with an access point for general purpose buckets, you must provide the alias of the access point in place of the bucket name or specify the access point ARN. When you use this action with an access point for directory buckets, you must provide the access point name in place of the bucket name. When using the access point ARN, you must direct requests to the access point hostname. The access point hostname takes the form *AccessPointName*-*AccountId*.s3-accesspoint.*Region*.amazonaws.com. When using this action with an access point through the AWS SDKs, you provide the access point ARN in place of the bucket name. For more information about access point ARNs, see [Using access points](../userguide/using-access-points.md "../userguide/using-access-points.md") in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.


###### Note

Object Lambda access points are not supported by directory buckets.



**S3 on Outposts** - When you use this action with S3 on Outposts, you must direct requests to the S3 on Outposts hostname. The S3 on Outposts hostname takes the 
 form `*AccessPointName*-*AccountId*.*outpostID*.s3-outposts.*Region*.amazonaws.com`. When you use this action with S3 on Outposts, the destination bucket must be the Outposts access point ARN or the access point alias. For more information about S3 on Outposts, see [What is S3 on Outposts?](../userguide/S3onOutposts.md "../userguide/S3onOutposts.md") in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.
