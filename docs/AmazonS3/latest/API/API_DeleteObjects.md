# DeleteObjects

This operation enables you to delete multiple objects from a bucket using a single HTTP request. If
 you know the object keys that you want to delete, then this operation provides a suitable alternative to
 sending individual delete requests, reducing per-request overhead.

The request can contain a list of up to 1,000 keys that you want to delete. In the XML, you provide
 the object key names, and optionally, version IDs if you want to delete a specific version of the object
 from a versioning-enabled bucket. For each key, Amazon S3 performs a delete operation and returns the result
 of that delete, success or failure, in the response. If the object specified in the request isn't found,
 Amazon S3 confirms the deletion by returning the result as deleted.

###### Note


* **Directory buckets** -
 S3 Versioning isn't enabled and supported for directory buckets.
* **Directory buckets** - For directory buckets, you must make requests for this API operation to the Zonal endpoint. These endpoints support virtual-hosted-style requests in the format `https://*amzn-s3-demo-bucket*.s3express-*zone-id*.*region-code*.amazonaws.com/*key-name*`. Path-style requests are not supported. For more information about endpoints in Availability Zones, see [Regional and Zonal endpoints for directory buckets in Availability Zones](../userguide/endpoint-directory-buckets-AZ.md "../userguide/endpoint-directory-buckets-AZ.md") in the
 *Amazon S3 User Guide*. For more information about endpoints in Local Zones, see [Concepts for directory buckets in Local Zones](../userguide/s3-lzs-for-directory-buckets.md "../userguide/s3-lzs-for-directory-buckets.md") in the
 *Amazon S3 User Guide*.
The operation supports two modes for the response: verbose and quiet. By default, the operation uses
 verbose mode in which the response includes the result of deletion of each key in your request. In quiet
 mode the response includes only keys where the delete operation encountered an error. For a successful
 deletion in a quiet mode, the operation does not return any information about the delete in the response
 body.

When performing this action on an MFA Delete enabled bucket, that attempts to delete any versioned
 objects, you must include an MFA token. If you do not provide one, the entire request will fail, even if
 there are non-versioned objects you are trying to delete. If you provide an invalid token, whether there
 are versioned keys in the request or not, the entire Multi-Object Delete request will fail. For
 information about MFA Delete, see [MFA Delete](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/Versioning.html#MultiFactorAuthenticationDelete "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/Versioning.html#MultiFactorAuthenticationDelete") in the
 *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

###### Note


**Directory buckets** - MFA delete is not supported by directory buckets.



Permissions


* **General purpose bucket permissions** - The following
 permissions are required in your policies when your `DeleteObjects` request
 includes specific headers.




	+ **`s3:DeleteObject`** - To delete an
	 object from a bucket, you must always specify the `s3:DeleteObject`
	 permission.
	+ **`s3:DeleteObjectVersion`** - To delete a specific version of an object from a versioning-enabled
	 bucket, you must specify the `s3:DeleteObjectVersion` permission.
* **Directory bucket permissions** - To grant access to this API operation on a directory bucket, we recommend that you use the [`CreateSession`](API_CreateSession.md "API_CreateSession.md") API operation for session-based authorization. Specifically, you grant the `s3express:CreateSession` permission to the directory bucket in a bucket policy or an IAM identity-based policy. Then, you make the `CreateSession` API call on the bucket to obtain a session token. With the session token in your request header, you can make API requests to this operation. After the session token expires, you make another `CreateSession` API call to generate a new session token for use. 
AWS CLI or SDKs create session and refresh the session token automatically to avoid service interruptions when a session expires. For more information about authorization, see [`CreateSession`](API_CreateSession.md "API_CreateSession.md").


Content-MD5 request header


* **General purpose bucket** - The Content-MD5 request header
 is required for all Multi-Object Delete requests. Amazon S3 uses the header value to ensure that
 your request body has not been altered in transit.
* **Directory bucket** - The Content-MD5 request header
 or a additional checksum request header (including `x-amz-checksum-crc32`,
 `x-amz-checksum-crc32c`, `x-amz-checksum-sha1`, or
 `x-amz-checksum-sha256`) is required for all Multi-Object Delete requests.


HTTP Host header syntax


**Directory buckets**  - The HTTP Host header syntax is `*Bucket-name*.s3express-*zone-id*.*region-code*.amazonaws.com`.



The following operations are related to `DeleteObjects`:


* [CreateMultipartUpload](API_CreateMultipartUpload.md "API_CreateMultipartUpload.md")
* [UploadPart](API_UploadPart.md "API_UploadPart.md")
* [CompleteMultipartUpload](API_CompleteMultipartUpload.md "API_CompleteMultipartUpload.md")
* [ListParts](API_ListParts.md "API_ListParts.md")
* [AbortMultipartUpload](API_AbortMultipartUpload.md "API_AbortMultipartUpload.md")
###### Important

You must URL encode any signed header values that contain spaces. For example, if your header value is `my file.txt`, containing two spaces after `my`, you must URL encode this value to `my%20%20file.txt`.

## URI Request Parameters


The request uses the following URI parameters.





**[Bucket](#API_DeleteObjects_RequestSyntax "#API_DeleteObjects_RequestSyntax")**


The bucket name containing the objects to delete. 



**Directory buckets** - When you use this operation with a directory bucket, you must use virtual-hosted-style requests in the format `*Bucket-name*.s3express-*zone-id*.*region-code*.amazonaws.com`. Path-style requests are not supported. Directory bucket names must be unique in the chosen Zone (Availability Zone or Local Zone). Bucket names must follow the format `*bucket-base-name*--*zone-id*--x-s3` (for example, `*amzn-s3-demo-bucket*--*usw2-az1*--x-s3`). For information about bucket naming
 restrictions, see [Directory bucket naming
 rules](../userguide/directory-bucket-naming-rules.md "../userguide/directory-bucket-naming-rules.md") in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.



**Access points** - When you use this action with an access point for general purpose buckets, you must provide the alias of the access point in place of the bucket name or specify the access point ARN. When you use this action with an access point for directory buckets, you must provide the access point name in place of the bucket name. When using the access point ARN, you must direct requests to the access point hostname. The access point hostname takes the form *AccessPointName*-*AccountId*.s3-accesspoint.*Region*.amazonaws.com. When using this action with an access point through the AWS SDKs, you provide the access point ARN in place of the bucket name. For more information about access point ARNs, see [Using access points](../userguide/using-access-points.md "../userguide/using-access-points.md") in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.


###### Note

Object Lambda access points are not supported by directory buckets.



**S3 on Outposts** - When you use this action with S3 on Outposts, you must direct requests to the S3 on Outposts hostname. The S3 on Outposts hostname takes the 
 form `*AccessPointName*-*AccountId*.*outpostID*.s3-outposts.*Region*.amazonaws.com`. When you use this action with S3 on Outposts, the destination bucket must be the Outposts access point ARN or the access point alias. For more information about S3 on Outposts, see [What is S3 on Outposts?](../userguide/S3onOutposts.md "../userguide/S3onOutposts.md") in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.


Required: Yes




**[x-amz-bypass-governance-retention](#API_DeleteObjects_RequestSyntax "#API_DeleteObjects_RequestSyntax")**


Specifies whether you want to delete this object even if it has a Governance-type Object Lock in
 place. To use this header, you must have the `s3:BypassGovernanceRetention`
 permission.


###### Note

This functionality is not supported for directory buckets.




**[x-amz-expected-bucket-owner](#API_DeleteObjects_RequestSyntax "#API_DeleteObjects_RequestSyntax")**


The account ID of the expected bucket owner. If the account ID that you provide does not match the actual owner of the bucket, the request fails with the HTTP status code `403 Forbidden` (access denied).




**[x-amz-mfa](#API_DeleteObjects_RequestSyntax "#API_DeleteObjects_RequestSyntax")**


The concatenation of the authentication device's serial number, a space, and the value that is
 displayed on your authentication device. Required to permanently delete a versioned object if versioning
 is configured with MFA delete enabled.


When performing the `DeleteObjects` operation on an MFA delete enabled bucket, which
 attempts to delete the specified versioned objects, you must include an MFA token. If you don't provide
 an MFA token, the entire request will fail, even if there are non-versioned objects that you are trying
 to delete. If you provide an invalid token, whether there are versioned object keys in the request or
 not, the entire Multi-Object Delete request will fail. For information about MFA Delete, see  [MFA
 Delete](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/Versioning.html#MultiFactorAuthenticationDelete "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/Versioning.html#MultiFactorAuthenticationDelete") in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.


###### Note

This functionality is not supported for directory buckets.




**[x-amz-request-payer](#API_DeleteObjects_RequestSyntax "#API_DeleteObjects_RequestSyntax")**


Confirms that the requester knows that they will be charged for the request. Bucket owners need not
 specify this parameter in their requests. If either the source or destination S3 bucket has Requester
 Pays enabled, the requester will pay for corresponding charges to copy the object. For information about
 downloading objects from Requester Pays buckets, see [Downloading Objects in Requester Pays
 Buckets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/ObjectsinRequesterPaysBuckets.html "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/ObjectsinRequesterPaysBuckets.html") in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.


###### Note

This functionality is not supported for directory buckets.


Valid Values: `requester`





**[x-amz-sdk-checksum-algorithm](#API_DeleteObjects_RequestSyntax "#API_DeleteObjects_RequestSyntax")**


Indicates the algorithm used to create the checksum for the object when you use the SDK. This header will not provide any
 additional functionality if you don't use the SDK. When you send this header, there must be a corresponding `x-amz-checksum-*algorithm*` or
 `x-amz-trailer` header sent. Otherwise, Amazon S3 fails the request with the HTTP status code `400 Bad Request`.


For the `x-amz-checksum-*algorithm*` header, replace `*algorithm*` with the supported algorithm from the following list: 



* `CRC32`
* `CRC32C`
* `CRC64NVME`
* `SHA1`
* `SHA256`

For more
 information, see [Checking object integrity](../userguide/checking-object-integrity.md "../userguide/checking-object-integrity.md") in
 the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.


If the individual checksum value you provide through `x-amz-checksum-*algorithm*` doesn't match the checksum algorithm you set through `x-amz-sdk-checksum-algorithm`, Amazon S3 fails the request with a `BadDigest` error.


If you provide an individual checksum, Amazon S3 ignores any provided `ChecksumAlgorithm`
 parameter.


Valid Values: `CRC32 | CRC32C | SHA1 | SHA256 | CRC64NVME`





## Request Body


The request accepts the following data in XML format.





**[Delete](#API_DeleteObjects_RequestSyntax "#API_DeleteObjects_RequestSyntax")**


Root level tag for the Delete parameters.


Required: Yes




**[Object](#API_DeleteObjects_RequestSyntax "#API_DeleteObjects_RequestSyntax")**

###### Note


**Directory buckets** - For directory buckets, an object
 that's composed entirely of whitespace characters is not supported by the `DeleteObjects`
 API operation. The request will receive a `400 Bad Request` error and none of the objects
 in the request will be deleted.


Type: Array of [ObjectIdentifier](API_ObjectIdentifier.md "API_ObjectIdentifier.md") data types


Required: Yes




**[Quiet](#API_DeleteObjects_RequestSyntax "#API_DeleteObjects_RequestSyntax")**


Element to enable quiet mode for the request. When you add this element, you must set its value to
 `true`.

## Examples


### Sample Request for general purpose buckets: Multi-object delete resulting in mixed success/error
 response


This example illustrates a Multi-Object Delete request to delete objects that result in mixed
 success and errors response. The following request deletes two objects from a bucket
 (`amzn-s3-demo-bucket`). In this example, the requester does not have permission to
 delete the `sample2.txt` object. 



```
POST /?delete HTTP/1.1
Host: amzn-s3-demo-bucket.s3.<Region>.amazonaws.com
Accept: */*
x-amz-date: Wed, 30 Nov 2011 03:39:05 GMT

Connection: Keep-Alive

<Delete>
<Object>
<Key>sample1.txt</Key>
</Object>
<Object>
<Key>sample2.txt</Key>
</Object>
</Delete>
```

### Sample Response for general purpose buckets


The response includes a `DeleteResult` element that includes a `Deleted`
 element for the item that Amazon S3 successfully deleted and an `Error` element that Amazon S3 did
 not delete because you didn't have permission to delete the object. 



```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK

</DeleteResult>
```

### Sample Request for general purpose buckets: Deleting an object from a versioned bucket


If you delete an item from a versioning enabled bucket, all versions of that object remain in
 the bucket. However, Amazon S3 inserts a delete marker. For more information, see  [Object
 Versioning](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/ObjectVersioning.html "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/ObjectVersioning.html").


The following scenarios describe the behavior of a multi-object Delete request when versioning
 is enabled for your bucket.


Case 1 - Simple Delete: In the following sample request, the multi-object delete request
 specifies only one key.



```
POST /?delete HTTP/1.1
Host: amzn-s3-demo-bucket.s3.<Region>.amazonaws.com
Accept: */*
x-amz-date: Wed, 30 Nov 2011 03:39:05 GMT
Content-MD5: p5/WA/oEr30qrEEl21PAqw==
Authorization: AWS AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE:W0qPYCLe6JwkZAD1ei6hp9XZIee=
Content-Length: 79
Connection: Keep-Alive

<Delete>
  <Object>
    <Key>SampleDocument.txt</Key>
  </Object>
</Delete>
```

### Sample Response for general purpose buckets


Because versioning is enabled on the bucket, Amazon S3 does not delete the object. Instead, it adds a
 delete marker for this object. The following response indicates that a delete marker was added (the
 `DeleteMarker` element in the response as a value of true) and the version number of
 the delete marker it added.



```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
x-amz-id-2: P3xqrhuhYxlrefdw3rEzmJh8z5KDtGzb+/FB7oiQaScI9Yaxd8olYXc7d1111ab+
x-amz-request-id: 264A17BF16E9E80A
Date: Wed, 30 Nov 2011 03:39:32 GMT
Content-Type: application/xml
Server: AmazonS3
Content-Length: 276

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<DeleteResult xmlns="http://s3.amazonaws.com/doc/2006-03-01/">
  <Deleted>
  <Key>SampleDocument.txt</Key>
    <DeleteMarker>true</DeleteMarker> 
    <DeleteMarkerVersionId>NeQt5xeFTfgPJD8B4CGWnkSLtluMr11s</DeleteMarkerVersionId>
  </Deleted>
</DeleteResult>
```

### Case 2 for general purpose buckets - Versioned Delete


The following request attempts to delete a specific version of an object.



```
POST /?delete HTTP/1.1
Host: amzn-s3-demo-bucket.s3.<Region>.amazonaws.com
Accept: */*
x-amz-date: Wed, 30 Nov 2011 03:39:05 GMT
Content-MD5: p5/WA/oEr30qrEEl21PAqw==
Authorization: AWS AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE:W0qPYCLe6JwkZAD1ei6hp9XZIxx=
Content-Length: 140
Connection: Keep-Alive

<Delete>
  <Object>
    <Key>SampleDocument.txt</Key>
    <VersionId>OYcLXagmS.WaD..oyH4KRguB95_YhLs7</VersionId>
  </Object>
</Delete>
```

### Sample Response for general purpose buckets


In this case, Amazon S3 deletes the specific object version from the bucket and returns the following
 response. In the response, Amazon S3 returns the key and version ID of the object deleted.



```
HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
x-amz-id-2: P3xqrhuhYxlrefdw3rEzmJh8z5KDtGzb+/FB7oiQaScI9Yaxd8olYXc7d1111xx+
x-amz-request-id: 264A17BF16E9E80A
Date: Wed, 30 Nov 2011 03:39:32 GMT
Content-Type: application/xml
Server: AmazonS3
Content-Length: 219

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<DeleteResult xmlns="http://s3.amazonaws.com/doc/2006-03-01/">
  <Deleted>
    <Key>SampleDocument.txt</Key>
    <VersionId>OYcLXagmS.WaD..oyH4KRguB95_YhLs7</VersionId>
  </Deleted>
</DeleteResult>
```

### Case 3 for general purpose buckets - Versioned delete of a delete marker


In the preceding example, the request refers to a delete marker (instead of an object), then
 Amazon S3 deletes the delete marker. The effect of this action is to make your object reappear in your
 bucket. Amazon S3 returns a response that indicates the delete marker it deleted
 (`DeleteMarker` element with value true) and the version ID of the delete
 marker.



```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
x-amz-id-2: IIPUZrtolxDEmWsKOae9JlSZe6yWfTye3HQ3T2iAe0ZE4XHa6NKvAJcPp51zZaBr
x-amz-request-id: D6B284CEC9B05E4E
Date: Wed, 30 Nov 2011 03:43:25 GMT
Content-Type: application/xml
Server: AmazonS3
Content-Length: 331

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<DeleteResult xmlns="http://s3.amazonaws.com/doc/2006-03-01/">
<Deleted>
<Key>SampleDocument.txt</Key>
<VersionId>NeQt5xeFTfgPJD8B4CGWnkSLtluMr11s</VersionId>
<DeleteMarker>true</DeleteMarker>  
<DeleteMarkerVersionId>NeQt5xeFTfgPJD8B4CGWnkSLtluMr11s</DeleteMarkerVersionId> 
</Deleted>
</DeleteResult>
```

### Sample Response for general purpose buckets


In general, when a multi-object Delete request results in Amazon S3 either adding a delete marker or
 removing a delete marker, the response returns the following elements.



```
<DeleteMarker>true</DeleteMarker>  
<DeleteMarkerVersionId>NeQt5xeFTfgPJD8B4CGWnkSLtluMr11s</DeleteMarkerVersionId> 
```

### Sample Request for general purpose buckets: Malformed XML in the request


This example shows how Amazon S3 responds to a request that includes a malformed XML document. The
 following request sends a malformed XML document (missing the Delete end element).



```
POST /?delete HTTP/1.1
Host: amzn-s3-demo-bucket.s3.<Region>.amazonaws.com
Accept: */*
x-amz-date: Wed, 30 Nov 2011 03:39:05 GMT
Content-MD5: p5/WA/oEr30qrEEl21PAqw==
Authorization: AWS AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE:W0qPYCLe6JwkZAD1ei6hp9XZIee=
Content-Length: 104
Connection: Keep-Alive

<Delete>
  <Object>
    <Key>404.txt</Key>
  </Object>
  <Object>
    <Key>a.txt</Key>
  </Object>

```

### Sample Response for general purpose buckets


The response returns the error messages that describe the error.

### Sample Request for general purpose buckets: DeleteObjects containing a carriage return


The following example illustrates the use of an XML entity code as a substitution for a carriage
 return. This `DeleteObjects` request deletes an object with the `key`
 parameter: `/some/prefix/objectwith\rcarriagereturn` (where the `\r` is the
 carriage return).



```
<Delete xmlns="http://s3.amazonaws.com/doc/2006-03-01/">
<Object>
<Key>/some/prefix/objectwith&#13;carriagereturn</Key>
</Object>
</Delete>
```

### Sample Request for directory buckets: Conditional deletes


The following example shows a multi-object delete request. Each object sub-section in the XML
 also includes one or more preconditions around that object's `Etag`,
 `Last-Modified-Time` and `Size` that need to hold true for its deletion to
 succeed. 



```
