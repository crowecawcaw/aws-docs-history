# CopyObject

Creates a copy of an object that is already stored in Amazon S3.

###### Important

End of support notice: As of October 1, 2025, Amazon S3 has discontinued support for Email Grantee Access Control Lists (ACLs). If you attempt to use an Email Grantee ACL in a request after October 1, 2025, 
 the request will receive an `HTTP 405` (Method Not Allowed) error.

This change affects the following AWS Regions: US East (N. Virginia), US West (N. California), US West (Oregon), Asia Pacific (Singapore), Asia Pacific (Sydney), Asia Pacific (Tokyo), Europe (Ireland), and South America (São Paulo).

###### Note

You can store individual objects of up to 5 TB in Amazon S3. You create a copy of your object up to 5
 GB in size in a single atomic action using this API. However, to copy an object greater than 5 GB, you
 must use the multipart upload Upload Part - Copy (UploadPartCopy) API. For more information, see
 [Copy Object
 Using the REST Multipart Upload API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/CopyingObjctsUsingRESTMPUapi.html "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/CopyingObjctsUsingRESTMPUapi.html").

You can copy individual objects between general purpose buckets, between directory buckets, and between
 general purpose buckets and directory buckets.

###### Note


* Amazon S3 supports copy operations using Multi-Region Access Points only as a destination when
 using the Multi-Region Access Point ARN.
* **Directory buckets**  - For directory buckets, you must make requests for this API operation to the Zonal endpoint. These endpoints support virtual-hosted-style requests in the format `https://*amzn-s3-demo-bucket*.s3express-*zone-id*.*region-code*.amazonaws.com/*key-name*`. Path-style requests are not supported. For more information about endpoints in Availability Zones, see [Regional and Zonal endpoints for directory buckets in Availability Zones](../userguide/endpoint-directory-buckets-AZ.md "../userguide/endpoint-directory-buckets-AZ.md") in the
 *Amazon S3 User Guide*. For more information about endpoints in Local Zones, see [Concepts for directory buckets in Local Zones](../userguide/s3-lzs-for-directory-buckets.md "../userguide/s3-lzs-for-directory-buckets.md") in the
 *Amazon S3 User Guide*.
* VPC endpoints don't support cross-Region requests (including copies). If you're using VPC
 endpoints, your source and destination buckets should be in the same AWS Region as your VPC
 endpoint.
Both the Region that you want to copy the object from and the Region that you want to copy the
 object to must be enabled for your account. For more information about how to enable a Region for your
 account, see [Enable
 or disable a Region for standalone accounts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/accounts/latest/reference/manage-acct-regions.html#manage-acct-regions-enable-standalone "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/accounts/latest/reference/manage-acct-regions.html#manage-acct-regions-enable-standalone") in the *AWS Account Management
 Guide*.

###### Important

Amazon S3 transfer acceleration does not support cross-Region copies. If you request a cross-Region
 copy using a transfer acceleration endpoint, you get a `400 Bad Request` error. For more
 information, see [Transfer Acceleration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/transfer-acceleration.html "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/transfer-acceleration.html").



Authentication and authorization

All `CopyObject` requests must be authenticated and signed by using IAM
 credentials (access key ID and secret access key for the IAM identities). All headers with the
 `x-amz-` prefix, including `x-amz-copy-source`, must be signed. For more
 information, see [REST Authentication](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/RESTAuthentication.html "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/RESTAuthentication.html").



**Directory buckets** - You must use the IAM
 credentials to authenticate and authorize your access to the `CopyObject` API
 operation, instead of using the temporary security credentials through the
 `CreateSession` API operation.



 AWS CLI or SDKs handles authentication and authorization on your behalf.



Permissions

You must have *read* access to the source object and
 *write* access to the destination bucket.



* **General purpose bucket permissions** - You must have
 permissions in an IAM policy based on the source and destination bucket types in a
 `CopyObject` operation.




	+ If the source object is in a general purpose bucket, you must have **`s3:GetObject`** permission to read the source object that is
	 being copied.
	+ If the destination bucket is a general purpose bucket, you must have **`s3:PutObject`** permission to write the object copy to the
	 destination bucket.
* **Directory bucket permissions** - You must have
 permissions in a bucket policy or an IAM identity-based policy based on the source and destination bucket types
 in a `CopyObject` operation.




	+ If the source object that you want to copy is in a directory bucket, you must have
	 the **`s3express:CreateSession`** permission in
	 the `Action` element of a policy to read the object. By default, the session is
	 in the `ReadWrite` mode. If you want to restrict the access, you can explicitly
	 set the `s3express:SessionMode` condition key to `ReadOnly` on the
	 copy source bucket.
	+ If the copy destination is a directory bucket, you must have the **`s3express:CreateSession`** permission in the
	 `Action` element of a policy to write the object to the destination. The
	 `s3express:SessionMode` condition key can't be set to `ReadOnly`
	 on the copy destination bucket.
If the object is encrypted with SSE-KMS, you must also have the
 `kms:GenerateDataKey` and `kms:Decrypt` permissions in IAM
 identity-based policies and AWS KMS key policies for the AWS KMS key.


For example policies, see [Example
 bucket policies for S3 Express One Zone](../userguide/s3-express-security-iam-example-bucket-policies.md "../userguide/s3-express-security-iam-example-bucket-policies.md") and [AWS
 Identity and Access Management (IAM) identity-based policies for S3 Express One Zone](../userguide/s3-express-security-iam-identity-policies.md "../userguide/s3-express-security-iam-identity-policies.md") in the
 *Amazon S3 User Guide*.


Response and special errors

When the request is an HTTP 1.1 request, the response is chunk encoded. When the request is
 not an HTTP 1.1 request, the response would not contain the `Content-Length`. You
 always need to read the entire response body to check if the copy succeeds. 



* If the copy is successful, you receive a response with information about the copied
 object.
* A copy request might return an error when Amazon S3 receives the copy request or while Amazon S3 is
 copying the files. A `200 OK` response can contain either a success or an
 error.




	+ If the error occurs before the copy action starts, you receive a standard Amazon S3
	 error.
	+ If the error occurs during the copy operation, the error response is embedded in the
	 `200 OK` response. For example, in a cross-region copy, you may encounter
	 throttling and receive a `200 OK` response. For more information, see [Resolve the Error
	 200 response when copying objects to Amazon S3](https://repost.aws/knowledge-center/s3-resolve-200-internalerror "https://repost.aws/knowledge-center/s3-resolve-200-internalerror"). The `200 OK` status code
	 means the copy was accepted, but it doesn't mean the copy is complete. Another example is
	 when you disconnect from Amazon S3 before the copy is complete, Amazon S3 might cancel the copy and
	 you may receive a `200 OK` response. You must stay connected to Amazon S3 until the
	 entire response is successfully received and processed.
	
	
	If you call this API operation directly, make sure to design your application to parse
	 the content of the response and handle it appropriately. If you use AWS SDKs, SDKs
	 handle this condition. The SDKs detect the embedded error and apply error handling per
	 your configuration settings (including automatically retrying the request as appropriate).
	 If the condition persists, the SDKs throw an exception (or, for the SDKs that don't use
	 exceptions, they return an error).


Charge

The copy request charge is based on the storage class and Region that you specify for the
 destination object. The request can also result in a data retrieval charge for the source if the
 source storage class bills for data retrieval. If the copy source is in a different region, the
 data transfer is billed to the copy source account. For pricing information, see [Amazon S3 pricing](http://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing/ "http://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing/").



HTTP Host header syntax


* **Directory buckets**  - The HTTP Host header syntax is `*Bucket-name*.s3express-*zone-id*.*region-code*.amazonaws.com`.
* **Amazon S3 on Outposts** - When you use this action with
 S3 on Outposts through the REST API, you must direct requests to the S3 on Outposts hostname. The
 S3 on Outposts hostname takes the form
 `*AccessPointName*-*AccountId*.*outpostID*.s3-outposts.*Region*.amazonaws.com`.
 The hostname isn't required when you use the AWS CLI or SDKs.


The following operations are related to `CopyObject`:


* [PutObject](API_PutObject.md "API_PutObject.md")
* [GetObject](API_GetObject.md "API_GetObject.md")
###### Important

You must URL encode any signed header values that contain spaces. For example, if your header value is `my file.txt`, containing two spaces after `my`, you must URL encode this value to `my%20%20file.txt`.

## URI Request Parameters


The request uses the following URI parameters.





**[Bucket](#API_CopyObject_RequestSyntax "#API_CopyObject_RequestSyntax")**


The name of the destination bucket.



**Directory buckets** - When you use this operation with a directory bucket, you must use virtual-hosted-style requests in the format `*Bucket-name*.s3express-*zone-id*.*region-code*.amazonaws.com`. Path-style requests are not supported. Directory bucket names must be unique in the chosen Zone (Availability Zone or Local Zone). Bucket names must follow the format `*bucket-base-name*--*zone-id*--x-s3` (for example, `*amzn-s3-demo-bucket*--*usw2-az1*--x-s3`). For information about bucket naming
 restrictions, see [Directory bucket naming
 rules](../userguide/directory-bucket-naming-rules.md "../userguide/directory-bucket-naming-rules.md") in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.


###### Note

Copying objects across different AWS Regions isn't supported when the source or destination
 bucket is in AWS Local Zones. The source and destination buckets must have the same parent AWS Region.
 Otherwise, you get an HTTP `400 Bad Request` error with the error code
 `InvalidRequest`.



**Access points** - When you use this action with an access point for general purpose buckets, you must provide the alias of the access point in place of the bucket name or specify the access point ARN. When you use this action with an access point for directory buckets, you must provide the access point name in place of the bucket name. When using the access point ARN, you must direct requests to the access point hostname. The access point hostname takes the form *AccessPointName*-*AccountId*.s3-accesspoint.*Region*.amazonaws.com. When using this action with an access point through the AWS SDKs, you provide the access point ARN in place of the bucket name. For more information about access point ARNs, see [Using access points](../userguide/using-access-points.md "../userguide/using-access-points.md") in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.


###### Note

Object Lambda access points are not supported by directory buckets.



**S3 on Outposts** - When you use this action with S3 on Outposts,
 you must use the Outpost bucket access point ARN or the access point alias for the destination bucket.
 You can only copy objects within the same Outpost bucket. It's not supported to copy objects across
 different AWS Outposts, between buckets on the same Outposts, or between Outposts buckets and any
 other bucket types. For more information about S3 on Outposts, see [What is S3 on Outposts?](../userguide/S3onOutposts.md "../userguide/S3onOutposts.md") in the
 *S3 on Outposts guide*. When you use this action with S3 on Outposts through the REST
 API, you must direct requests to the S3 on Outposts hostname, in the format
 `*AccessPointName*-*AccountId*.*outpostID*.s3-outposts.*Region*.amazonaws.com`.
 The hostname isn't required when you use the AWS CLI or SDKs. 


Required: Yes




**[Cache-Control](#API_CopyObject_RequestSyntax "#API_CopyObject_RequestSyntax")**


Specifies the caching behavior along the request/reply chain.




**[Content-Disposition](#API_CopyObject_RequestSyntax "#API_CopyObject_RequestSyntax")**


Specifies presentational information for the object. Indicates whether an object should be displayed
 in a web browser or downloaded as a file. It allows specifying the desired filename for the downloaded
 file.




**[Content-Encoding](#API_CopyObject_RequestSyntax "#API_CopyObject_RequestSyntax")**


Specifies what content encodings have been applied to the object and thus what decoding mechanisms
 must be applied to obtain the media-type referenced by the Content-Type header field.


###### Note

For directory buckets, only the `aws-chunked` value is supported in this header field.




**[Content-Language](#API_CopyObject_RequestSyntax "#API_CopyObject_RequestSyntax")**


The language the content is in.




**[Content-Type](#API_CopyObject_RequestSyntax "#API_CopyObject_RequestSyntax")**


A standard MIME type that describes the format of the object data.




**[Expires](#API_CopyObject_RequestSyntax "#API_CopyObject_RequestSyntax")**


The date and time at which the object is no longer cacheable.




**[Key](#API_CopyObject_RequestSyntax "#API_CopyObject_RequestSyntax")**


The key of the destination object.


Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1.


Required: Yes




**[x-amz-acl](#API_CopyObject_RequestSyntax "#API_CopyObject_RequestSyntax")**


The canned access control list (ACL) to apply to the object.


When you copy an object, the ACL metadata is not preserved and is set to `private` by
 default. Only the owner has full access control. To override the default ACL setting, specify a new ACL
 when you generate a copy request. For more information, see [Using ACLs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/S3_ACLs_UsingACLs.html "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/S3_ACLs_UsingACLs.html"). 


If the destination bucket that you're copying objects to uses the bucket owner enforced setting for
 S3 Object Ownership, ACLs are disabled and no longer affect permissions. Buckets that use this setting
 only accept `PUT` requests that don't specify an ACL or `PUT` requests that
 specify bucket owner full control ACLs, such as the `bucket-owner-full-control` canned ACL or
 an equivalent form of this ACL expressed in the XML format. For more information, see [Controlling ownership
 of objects and disabling ACLs](../userguide/about-object-ownership.md "../userguide/about-object-ownership.md") in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.


###### Note


* If your destination bucket uses the bucket owner enforced setting for Object Ownership, all
 objects written to the bucket by any account will be owned by the bucket owner.
* This functionality is not supported for directory buckets.
* This functionality is not supported for Amazon S3 on Outposts.

Valid Values: `private | public-read | public-read-write | authenticated-read | aws-exec-read | bucket-owner-read | bucket-owner-full-control`





**[x-amz-checksum-algorithm](#API_CopyObject_RequestSyntax "#API_CopyObject_RequestSyntax")**


Indicates the algorithm that you want Amazon S3 to use to create the checksum for the object. For more information, see
 [Checking object integrity](../userguide/checking-object-integrity.md "../userguide/checking-object-integrity.md") in
 the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.


When you copy an object, if the source object has a checksum, that checksum value will be copied to
 the new object by default. If the `CopyObject` request does not include this
 `x-amz-checksum-algorithm` header, the checksum algorithm will be copied from the source
 object to the destination object (if it's present on the source object). You can optionally specify a
 different checksum algorithm to use with the `x-amz-checksum-algorithm` header. Unrecognized
 or unsupported values will respond with the HTTP status code `400 Bad Request`.


###### Note

For directory buckets, when you use AWS SDKs, `CRC32` is the default checksum algorithm that's used for performance.


Valid Values: `CRC32 | CRC32C | SHA1 | SHA256 | CRC64NVME`





**[x-amz-copy-source](#API_CopyObject_RequestSyntax "#API_CopyObject_RequestSyntax")**


Specifies the source object for the copy operation. The source object can be up to 5 GB. If the
 source object is an object that was uploaded by using a multipart upload, the object copy will be a
 single part object after the source object is copied to the destination bucket.


You specify the value of the copy source in one of two formats, depending on whether you want to
 access the source object through an [access point](../userguide/access-points.md "../userguide/access-points.md"):



* For objects not accessed through an access point, specify the name of the source bucket and the key of
 the source object, separated by a slash (/). For example, to copy the object
 `reports/january.pdf` from the general purpose bucket `awsexamplebucket`, use
 `awsexamplebucket/reports/january.pdf`. The value must be URL-encoded. To copy the
 object `reports/january.pdf` from the directory bucket
 `awsexamplebucket--use1-az5--x-s3`, use
 `awsexamplebucket--use1-az5--x-s3/reports/january.pdf`. The value must be
 URL-encoded.
* For objects accessed through access points, specify the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the object as accessed through the access point, in the format `arn:aws:s3:<Region>:<account-id>:accesspoint/<access-point-name>/object/<key>`. For example, to copy the object `reports/january.pdf` through access point `my-access-point` owned by account `123456789012` in Region `us-west-2`, use the URL encoding of `arn:aws:s3:us-west-2:123456789012:accesspoint/my-access-point/object/reports/january.pdf`. The value must be URL encoded.


###### Note



	+ Amazon S3 supports copy operations using Access points only when the source and destination buckets are in the same AWS Region.
	+ Access points are not supported by directory buckets.
Alternatively, for objects accessed through Amazon S3 on Outposts, specify the ARN of the object as accessed in the format `arn:aws:s3-outposts:<Region>:<account-id>:outpost/<outpost-id>/object/<key>`. For example, to copy the object `reports/january.pdf` through outpost `my-outpost` owned by account `123456789012` in Region `us-west-2`, use the URL encoding of `arn:aws:s3-outposts:us-west-2:123456789012:outpost/my-outpost/object/reports/january.pdf`. The value must be URL-encoded.

If your source bucket versioning is enabled, the `x-amz-copy-source` header by default
 identifies the current version of an object to copy. If the current version is a delete marker, Amazon S3
 behaves as if the object was deleted. To copy a different version, use the `versionId` query
 parameter. Specifically, append `?versionId=<version-id>` to the value (for example,
 `awsexamplebucket/reports/january.pdf?versionId=QUpfdndhfd8438MNFDN93jdnJFkdmqnh893`). If
 you don't specify a version ID, Amazon S3 copies the latest version of the source object.


If you enable versioning on the destination bucket, Amazon S3 generates a unique version ID for the
 copied object. This version ID is different from the version ID of the source object. Amazon S3 returns the
 version ID of the copied object in the `x-amz-version-id` response header in the
 response.


If you do not enable versioning or suspend it on the destination bucket, the version ID that Amazon S3
 generates in the `x-amz-version-id` response header is always null.


###### Note


**Directory buckets** - S3 Versioning isn't enabled and supported for directory buckets.


Pattern: `\/?.+\/.+`



Required: Yes




**[x-amz-copy-source-if-match](#API_CopyObject_RequestSyntax "#API_CopyObject_RequestSyntax")**


Copies the object if its entity tag (ETag) matches the specified tag.


 If both the `x-amz-copy-source-if-match` and
 `x-amz-copy-source-if-unmodified-since` headers are present in the request and evaluate as
 follows, Amazon S3 returns `200 OK` and copies the data:



* `x-amz-copy-source-if-match` condition evaluates to true
* `x-amz-copy-source-if-unmodified-since` condition evaluates to false



**[x-amz-copy-source-if-modified-since](#API_CopyObject_RequestSyntax "#API_CopyObject_RequestSyntax")**


Copies the object if it has been modified since the specified time.


If both the `x-amz-copy-source-if-none-match` and
 `x-amz-copy-source-if-modified-since` headers are present in the request and evaluate as
 follows, Amazon S3 returns the `412 Precondition Failed` response code:



* `x-amz-copy-source-if-none-match` condition evaluates to false
* `x-amz-copy-source-if-modified-since` condition evaluates to true



**[x-amz-copy-source-if-none-match](#API_CopyObject_RequestSyntax "#API_CopyObject_RequestSyntax")**


Copies the object if its entity tag (ETag) is different than the specified ETag.


If both the `x-amz-copy-source-if-none-match` and
 `x-amz-copy-source-if-modified-since` headers are present in the request and evaluate as
 follows, Amazon S3 returns the `412 Precondition Failed` response code:



* `x-amz-copy-source-if-none-match` condition evaluates to false
* `x-amz-copy-source-if-modified-since` condition evaluates to true



**[x-amz-copy-source-if-unmodified-since](#API_CopyObject_RequestSyntax "#API_CopyObject_RequestSyntax")**


Copies the object if it hasn't been modified since the specified time.


 If both the `x-amz-copy-source-if-match` and
 `x-amz-copy-source-if-unmodified-since` headers are present in the request and evaluate as
 follows, Amazon S3 returns `200 OK` and copies the data:



* `x-amz-copy-source-if-match` condition evaluates to true
* `x-amz-copy-source-if-unmodified-since` condition evaluates to false



**[x-amz-copy-source-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm](#API_CopyObject_RequestSyntax "#API_CopyObject_RequestSyntax")**


Specifies the algorithm to use when decrypting the source object (for example,
 `AES256`).


If the source object for the copy is stored in Amazon S3 using SSE-C, you must provide the necessary
 encryption information in your request so that Amazon S3 can decrypt the object for copying.


###### Note

This functionality is not supported when the source object is in a directory bucket.




**[x-amz-copy-source-server-side-encryption-customer-key](#API_CopyObject_RequestSyntax "#API_CopyObject_RequestSyntax")**


Specifies the customer-provided encryption key for Amazon S3 to use to decrypt the source object. The
 encryption key provided in this header must be the same one that was used when the source object was
 created.


If the source object for the copy is stored in Amazon S3 using SSE-C, you must provide the necessary
 encryption information in your request so that Amazon S3 can decrypt the object for copying.


###### Note

This functionality is not supported when the source object is in a directory bucket.




**[x-amz-copy-source-server-side-encryption-customer-key-MD5](#API_CopyObject_RequestSyntax "#API_CopyObject_RequestSyntax")**


Specifies the 128-bit MD5 digest of the encryption key according to RFC 1321. Amazon S3 uses this header
 for a message integrity check to ensure that the encryption key was transmitted without error.


If the source object for the copy is stored in Amazon S3 using SSE-C, you must provide the necessary
 encryption information in your request so that Amazon S3 can decrypt the object for copying.


###### Note

This functionality is not supported when the source object is in a directory bucket.




**[x-amz-expected-bucket-owner](#API_CopyObject_RequestSyntax "#API_CopyObject_RequestSyntax")**


The account ID of the expected destination bucket owner. If the account ID that you provide does not match the actual owner of the destination bucket, the request fails with the HTTP status code `403 Forbidden` (access denied).




**[x-amz-grant-full-control](#API_CopyObject_RequestSyntax "#API_CopyObject_RequestSyntax")**


Gives the grantee READ, READ\_ACP, and WRITE\_ACP permissions on the object.


###### Note

**[x-amz-metadata-directive](#API_CopyObject_RequestSyntax "#API_CopyObject_RequestSyntax")**


Specifies whether the metadata is copied from the source object or replaced with metadata that's
 provided in the request. When copying an object, you can preserve all metadata (the default) or specify
 new metadata. If this header isn’t specified, `COPY` is the default behavior. 



**General purpose bucket** - For general purpose buckets, when you grant
 permissions, you can use the `s3:x-amz-metadata-directive` condition key to enforce certain
 metadata behavior when objects are uploaded. For more information, see [Amazon S3 condition key examples](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/amazon-s3-policy-keys.html "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/amazon-s3-policy-keys.html") in the
 *Amazon S3 User Guide*.


###### Note


`x-amz-website-redirect-location` is unique to each object and is not copied when using
 the `x-amz-metadata-directive` header. To copy the value, you must specify

**[x-amz-request-payer](#API_CopyObject_RequestSyntax "#API_CopyObject_RequestSyntax")**


Confirms that the requester knows that they will be charged for the request. Bucket owners need not
 specify this parameter in their requests. If either the source or destination S3 bucket has Requester
 Pays enabled, the requester will pay for corresponding charges to copy the object. For information about
 downloading objects from Requester Pays buckets, see [Downloading Objects in Requester Pays
 Buckets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/ObjectsinRequesterPaysBuckets.html "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/ObjectsinRequesterPaysBuckets.html") in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.


###### Note

This functionality is not supported for directory buckets.


Valid Values: `requester`





**[x-amz-server-side-encryption](#API_CopyObject_RequestSyntax "#API_CopyObject_RequestSyntax")**


The server-side encryption algorithm used when storing this object in Amazon S3. Unrecognized or
 unsupported values won’t write a destination object and will receive a `400 Bad Request`
 response. 


Amazon S3 automatically encrypts all new objects that are copied to an S3 bucket. When copying an object,
 if you don't specify encryption information in your copy request, the encryption setting of the target
 object is set to the default encryption configuration of the destination bucket. By default, all buckets
 have a base level of encryption configuration that uses server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed keys
 (SSE-S3). If the destination bucket has a different default encryption configuration, Amazon S3 uses the
 corresponding encryption key to encrypt the target object copy.


With server-side encryption, Amazon S3 encrypts your data as it writes your data to disks in its data
 centers and decrypts the data when you access it. For more information about server-side encryption, see
 [Using Server-Side
 Encryption](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/serv-side-encryption.html "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/serv-side-encryption.html") in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.



**General purpose buckets** 




* For general purpose buckets, there are the following supported options for server-side encryption:
 server-side encryption with AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) keys (SSE-KMS), dual-layer server-side encryption with
 AWS KMS keys (DSSE-KMS), and server-side encryption with customer-provided encryption keys
 (SSE-C). Amazon S3 uses the corresponding KMS key, or a customer-provided key to encrypt the target
 object copy.
* When you perform a `CopyObject` operation, if you want to use a different type of
 encryption setting for the target object, you can specify appropriate encryption-related headers to
 encrypt the target object with an Amazon S3 managed key, a KMS key, or a customer-provided key. If the
 encryption setting in your request is different from the default encryption configuration of the
 destination bucket, the encryption setting in your request takes precedence.


**Directory buckets** 




* For directory buckets, there are only two supported options for server-side encryption: server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3) (`AES256`) and server-side encryption with AWS KMS keys (SSE-KMS) (`aws:kms`). We recommend that the bucket's default encryption uses the desired encryption configuration and you don't override the bucket default encryption in your 
 `CreateSession` requests or `PUT` object requests. Then, new objects 
 are automatically encrypted with the desired encryption settings. For more
 information, see [Protecting data with server-side encryption](../userguide/s3-express-serv-side-encryption.md "../userguide/s3-express-serv-side-encryption.md") in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*. For more information about the encryption overriding behaviors in directory buckets, see [Specifying server-side encryption with AWS KMS for new object uploads](../userguide/s3-express-specifying-kms-encryption.md "../userguide/s3-express-specifying-kms-encryption.md").
* To encrypt new object copies to a directory bucket with SSE-KMS, we recommend you specify
 SSE-KMS as the directory bucket's default encryption configuration with a KMS key
 (specifically, a [customer managed key](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#customer-cmk "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#customer-cmk")). The [AWS managed key](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#aws-managed-cmk "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#aws-managed-cmk") (`aws/s3`) isn't supported. Your SSE-KMS configuration can
 only support 1 [customer managed key](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#customer-cmk "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#customer-cmk") per
 directory bucket for the lifetime of the bucket. After you specify a customer managed key for SSE-KMS, you
 can't override the customer managed key for the bucket's SSE-KMS configuration. Then, when you
 perform a `CopyObject` operation and want to specify server-side encryption settings for
 new object copies with SSE-KMS in the encryption-related request headers, you must ensure the
 encryption key is the same customer managed key that you specified for the directory bucket's default
 encryption configuration.
* **S3 access points for Amazon FSx**  - When accessing data stored in
 Amazon FSx file systems using S3 access points, the only valid server side encryption option is
 `aws:fsx`. All Amazon FSx file systems have encryption configured by default and are
 encrypted at rest. Data is automatically encrypted before being written to the file system, and
 automatically decrypted as it is read. These processes are handled transparently by Amazon FSx.

Valid Values: `AES256 | aws:fsx | aws:kms | aws:kms:dsse`





**[x-amz-server-side-encryption-aws-kms-key-id](#API_CopyObject_RequestSyntax "#API_CopyObject_RequestSyntax")**


Specifies the AWS KMS key ID (Key ID, Key ARN, or Key Alias) to use for object encryption. All GET and
 PUT requests for an object protected by AWS KMS will fail if they're not made via SSL or using SigV4. For
 information about configuring any of the officially supported AWS SDKs and AWS CLI, see [Specifying
 the Signature Version in Request Authentication](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingAWSSDK.html#specify-signature-version "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingAWSSDK.html#specify-signature-version") in the
 *Amazon S3 User Guide*.



**Directory buckets** -
 To encrypt data using SSE-KMS, it's recommended to specify the 
`x-amz-server-side-encryption` header to `aws:kms`. Then, the `x-amz-server-side-encryption-aws-kms-key-id` header implicitly uses 
the bucket's default KMS customer managed key ID. If you want to explicitly set the `x-amz-server-side-encryption-aws-kms-key-id` header, it must match the bucket's default customer managed key (using key ID or ARN, not alias). Your SSE-KMS configuration can only support 1 [customer managed key](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#customer-cmk "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#customer-cmk") per directory bucket's lifetime. 
The [AWS managed key](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#aws-managed-cmk "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#aws-managed-cmk") (`aws/s3`) isn't supported. 
 
 Incorrect key specification results in an HTTP `400 Bad Request` error. 




**[x-amz-server-side-encryption-bucket-key-enabled](#API_CopyObject_RequestSyntax "#API_CopyObject_RequestSyntax")**


Specifies whether Amazon S3 should use an S3 Bucket Key for object encryption with server-side encryption
 using AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) keys (SSE-KMS). If a target object uses SSE-KMS, you can enable an S3 Bucket Key
 for the object.


Setting this header to `true` causes Amazon S3 to use an S3 Bucket Key for object encryption
 with SSE-KMS. Specifying this header with a COPY action doesn’t affect bucket-level settings for S3
 Bucket Key.


For more information, see [Amazon S3
 Bucket Keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/bucket-key.html "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/bucket-key.html") in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.


###### Note


**Directory buckets** -
 S3 Bucket Keys aren't supported, when you copy SSE-KMS encrypted objects from general purpose buckets 
to directory buckets, from directory buckets to general purpose buckets, or between directory buckets, through [CopyObject](API_CopyObject.md "API_CopyObject.md"). In this case, Amazon S3 makes a call to AWS KMS every time a copy request is made for a KMS-encrypted object.




**[x-amz-server-side-encryption-context](#API_CopyObject_RequestSyntax "#API_CopyObject_RequestSyntax")**


Specifies the AWS KMS Encryption Context as an additional encryption context to use for the
 destination object encryption. The value of this header is a base64-encoded UTF-8 string holding JSON
 with the encryption context key-value pairs.



**General purpose buckets** - This value must be explicitly added to
 specify encryption context for `CopyObject` requests if you want an additional encryption
 context for your destination object. The additional encryption context of the source object won't be
 copied to the destination object. For more information, see [Encryption context](../userguide/UsingKMSEncryption.md#encryption-context "../userguide/UsingKMSEncryption.md#encryption-context")
 in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.



**Directory buckets** - You can optionally provide an explicit encryption context value. The value must match the default encryption context - the bucket Amazon Resource Name (ARN). An additional encryption context value is not supported. 




**[x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm](#API_CopyObject_RequestSyntax "#API_CopyObject_RequestSyntax")**


Specifies the algorithm to use when encrypting the object (for example, `AES256`).


When you perform a `CopyObject` operation, if you want to use a different type of
 encryption setting for the target object, you can specify appropriate encryption-related headers to
 encrypt the target object with an Amazon S3 managed key, a KMS key, or a customer-provided key. If the
 encryption setting in your request is different from the default encryption configuration of the
 destination bucket, the encryption setting in your request takes precedence. 


###### Note

This functionality is not supported when the destination bucket is a directory bucket.




**[x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key](#API_CopyObject_RequestSyntax "#API_CopyObject_RequestSyntax")**


Specifies the customer-provided encryption key for Amazon S3 to use in encrypting data. This value is
 used to store the object and then it is discarded. Amazon S3 does not store the encryption key. The key must
 be appropriate for use with the algorithm specified in the
 `x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm` header.


###### Note

This functionality is not supported when the destination bucket is a directory bucket.




**[x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key-MD5](#API_CopyObject_RequestSyntax "#API_CopyObject_RequestSyntax")**


Specifies the 128-bit MD5 digest of the encryption key according to RFC 1321. Amazon S3 uses this header
 for a message integrity check to ensure that the encryption key was transmitted without error.


###### Note

This functionality is not supported when the destination bucket is a directory bucket.




**[x-amz-source-expected-bucket-owner](#API_CopyObject_RequestSyntax "#API_CopyObject_RequestSyntax")**


The account ID of the expected source bucket owner. If the account ID that you provide does not match the actual owner of the source bucket, the request fails with the HTTP status code `403 Forbidden` (access denied).




**[x-amz-storage-class](#API_CopyObject_RequestSyntax "#API_CopyObject_RequestSyntax")**


If the `x-amz-storage-class` header is not used, the copied object will be stored in the
 `STANDARD` Storage Class by default. The `STANDARD` storage class provides high
 durability and high availability. Depending on performance needs, you can specify a different Storage
 Class. 


###### Note


* **Directory buckets**  -
 Directory buckets only support `EXPRESS_ONEZONE` (the S3 Express One Zone storage class) in Availability Zones and `ONEZONE_IA` (the S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access storage class) in Dedicated Local Zones. 
Unsupported storage class values won't write a destination object and will respond with the HTTP status code `400 Bad Request`.
* **Amazon S3 on Outposts**  - S3 on Outposts only uses the
 `OUTPOSTS` Storage Class.

You can use the `CopyObject` action to change the storage class of an object that is
 already stored in Amazon S3 by using the `x-amz-storage-class` header. For more information, see
 [Storage Classes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/storage-class-intro.html "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/storage-class-intro.html")
 in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.


Before using an object as a source object for the copy operation, you must restore a copy of it if
 it meets any of the following conditions:



* The storage class of the source object is `GLACIER` or
 `DEEP_ARCHIVE`.
* The storage class of the source object is `INTELLIGENT_TIERING` and it's [S3
 Intelligent-Tiering access tier](../userguide/intelligent-tiering-overview.md#intel-tiering-tier-definition "../userguide/intelligent-tiering-overview.md#intel-tiering-tier-definition") is `Archive Access` or `Deep Archive
 Access`.

For more information, see [RestoreObject](API_RestoreObject.md "API_RestoreObject.md") and [Copying Objects](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/CopyingObjectsExamples.html "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/CopyingObjectsExamples.html") in the
 *Amazon S3 User Guide*.


Valid Values: `STANDARD | REDUCED_REDUNDANCY | STANDARD_IA | ONEZONE_IA | INTELLIGENT_TIERING | GLACIER | DEEP_ARCHIVE | OUTPOSTS | GLACIER_IR | SNOW | EXPRESS_ONEZONE | FSX_OPENZFS`





**[x-amz-tagging](#API_CopyObject_RequestSyntax "#API_CopyObject_RequestSyntax")**


The tag-set for the object copy in the destination bucket. This value must be used in conjunction
 with the `x-amz-tagging-directive` if you choose `REPLACE` for the
 `x-amz-tagging-directive`. If you choose `COPY` for the
 `x-amz-tagging-directive`, you don't need to set the `x-amz-tagging` header,
 because the tag-set will be copied from the source object directly. The tag-set must be encoded as URL
 Query parameters.


The default value is the empty value.


###### Note


**Directory buckets** - For directory buckets in a `CopyObject` operation, only the empty tag-set is supported. Any requests that attempt to write non-empty tags into directory buckets will receive a `501 Not Implemented` status code. 
When the destination bucket is a directory bucket, you will receive a `501 Not Implemented` response in any of the following situations:


* When you attempt to `COPY` the tag-set from an S3 source object that has non-empty tags.
* When you attempt to `REPLACE` the tag-set of a source object and set a non-empty value to `x-amz-tagging`.
* When you don't set the `x-amz-tagging-directive` header and the source object has non-empty tags. This is because the default value of `x-amz-tagging-directive` is `COPY`.
Because only the empty tag-set is supported for directory buckets in a `CopyObject` operation, the following situations are allowed:


* When you attempt to `COPY` the tag-set from a directory bucket source object that has no tags to a general purpose bucket. It copies an empty tag-set to the destination object.
* When you attempt to `REPLACE` the tag-set of a directory bucket source object and set the `x-amz-tagging` value of the directory bucket destination object to empty.
* When you attempt to `REPLACE` the tag-set of a general purpose bucket source object that has non-empty tags and set the `x-amz-tagging` value of the directory bucket destination object to empty.
* When you attempt to `REPLACE` the tag-set of a directory bucket source object and don't set the `x-amz-tagging` value of the directory bucket destination object. This is because the default value of `x-amz-tagging` is the empty value.



**[x-amz-tagging-directive](#API_CopyObject_RequestSyntax "#API_CopyObject_RequestSyntax")**


Specifies whether the object tag-set is copied from the source object or replaced with the tag-set
 that's provided in the request.


The default value is `COPY`.


###### Note


**Directory buckets** - For directory buckets in a `CopyObject` operation, only the empty tag-set is supported. Any requests that attempt to write non-empty tags into directory buckets will receive a `501 Not Implemented` status code. 
When the destination bucket is a directory bucket, you will receive a `501 Not Implemented` response in any of the following situations:


* When you attempt to `COPY` the tag-set from an S3 source object that has non-empty tags.
* When you attempt to `REPLACE` the tag-set of a source object and set a non-empty value to `x-amz-tagging`.
* When you don't set the `x-amz-tagging-directive` header and the source object has non-empty tags. This is because the default value of `x-amz-tagging-directive` is `COPY`.
Because only the empty tag-set is supported for directory buckets in a `CopyObject` operation, the following situations are allowed:


* When you attempt to `COPY` the tag-set from a directory bucket source object that has no tags to a general purpose bucket. It copies an empty tag-set to the destination object.
* When you attempt to `REPLACE` the tag-set of a directory bucket source object and set the `x-amz-tagging` value of the directory bucket destination object to empty.
* When you attempt to `REPLACE` the tag-set of a general purpose bucket source object that has non-empty tags and set the `x-amz-tagging` value of the directory bucket destination object to empty.
* When you attempt to `REPLACE` the tag-set of a directory bucket source object and don't set the `x-amz-tagging` value of the directory bucket destination object. This is because the default value of `x-amz-tagging` is the empty value.

Valid Values: `COPY | REPLACE`





**[x-amz-website-redirect-location](#API_CopyObject_RequestSyntax "#API_CopyObject_RequestSyntax")**


If the destination bucket is configured as a website, redirects requests for this object copy to
 another object in the same bucket or to an external URL. Amazon S3 stores the value of this header in the
 object metadata. This value is unique to each object and is not copied when using the
 `x-amz-metadata-directive` header. Instead, you may opt to provide this header in
 combination with the `x-amz-metadata-directive` header.


###### Note

This functionality is not supported for directory buckets.
