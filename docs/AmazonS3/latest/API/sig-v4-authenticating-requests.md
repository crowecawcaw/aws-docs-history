Every interaction with Amazon S3 is either authenticated or anonymous. This section explains
 request authentication with the AWS Signature Version 4 algorithm.




###### Note

If you use the AWS SDKs (see [Sample Code and
 Libraries](https://aws.amazon.com/code "https://aws.amazon.com/code")) to send your requests, you don't need to read this section
 because the SDK clients authenticate your requests by using access keys that you
 provide. Unless you have a good reason not to, you should always use the AWS SDKs. In
 Regions that support both signature versions, you can request AWS SDKs to use specific
 signature version. For more information, see [Sending authenticated requests using the AWS SDKs](AuthUsingAcctOrUserCredentials.md#send-authenticated-request-SDKs "AuthUsingAcctOrUserCredentials.md#send-authenticated-request-SDKs"). You need to read this section only if you are
 implementing the AWS Signature Version 4 algorithm in your custom client. 

Authentication with AWS Signature Version 4 provides some or all of the following, depending
 on how you choose to sign your request:





* Verification of the identity of the requester –
 Authenticated requests require a signature that you create by using your access
 keys (access key ID, secret access key). For information about getting access
 keys, see [Understanding and Getting Your 
 Security Credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-sec-cred-types.html "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-sec-cred-types.html") in the *AWS General Reference*. If
 you are using temporary security credentials, the signature calculations also
 require a security token. For more information, see [Requesting Temporary Security
 Credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_request.html "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_request.html") in the *IAM User Guide*.
* In-transit data protection – In order to prevent
 tampering with a request while it is in transit, you use some of the request
 elements to calculate the request signature. Upon receiving the request, Amazon S3
 calculates the signature by using the same request elements. If any request
 component received by Amazon S3 does not match the component that was used to
 calculate the signature, Amazon S3 will reject the request.
* Protect against reuse of the signed portions of the request
 – The signed portions (using AWS Signatures) of requests are valid within 15
 minutes of the timestamp in the request. An unauthorized party who has access to a
 signed request can modify the unsigned portions of the request without affecting the
 request's validity in the 15 minute window. Because of this, we recommend that you
 maximize protection by signing request headers and body, making HTTPS requests to
 Amazon S3, and by using the `s3:x-amz-content-sha256` condition key (see [Amazon S3 Signature Version 4 Authentication
 Specific Policy Keys](bucket-policy-s3-sigv4-conditions.md "bucket-policy-s3-sigv4-conditions.md")) in AWS policies to require
 users to sign Amazon S3 request bodies.
###### Note

Amazon S3 supports Signature Version 4, a protocol for authenticating inbound API requests to AWS
 services, in all AWS Regions. At this time, AWS Regions created before January 30, 2014
 will continue to support the previous protocol, Signature Version 2. Any new Regions
 after January 30, 2014 will support only Signature Version 4 and therefore all requests
 to those Regions must be made with Signature Version 4.
 For
 more information about AWS Signature Version 2, see [Signing and Authenticating REST
 Requests](../userguide/RESTAuthentication.md "../userguide/RESTAuthentication.md") in the *Amazon Simple Storage Service User Guide*. 

## Authentication Methods


You can express authentication information by using one of the following
 methods:






* HTTP Authorization header – Using the HTTP
 `Authorization` header is the most common method of
 authenticating an Amazon S3 request. All of the Amazon S3 REST operations (except for
 browser-based uploads using POST requests) require this header. For more
 information about the `Authorization` header value, and how to calculate signature
 and related options, see [Authenticating Requests: Using the
 Authorization Header (AWS Signature Version 4)](sigv4-auth-using-authorization-header.md "sigv4-auth-using-authorization-header.md").
* Query string parameters – You can use
 a query string to express a request entirely in a URL. In this case, you use
 query parameters to provide request information, including the
 authentication information. Because the request signature is part of the
 URL, this type of URL is often referred to as a presigned URL. You can use
 presigned URLs to embed clickable links, which can be valid for up to seven
 days, in HTML. For more information, see [Authenticating Requests: Using Query Parameters (AWS
 Signature Version 4)](sigv4-query-string-auth.md "sigv4-query-string-auth.md").

 Amazon S3 also supports browser-based uploads that use HTTP POST requests. With an HTTP POST
 request, you can upload content to Amazon S3 directly from the browser. For information about
 authenticating POST requests, see [Browser-Based Uploads Using
 POST (AWS Signature Version 4)](sigv4-UsingHTTPPOST.md "sigv4-UsingHTTPPOST.md").




## Introduction to Signing Requests


Authentication information that you send in a request must include a signature. To
 calculate a signature, you first concatenate select request elements to form a string,
 referred to as the *string to sign*. You then use a signing key to
 calculate the hash-based message authentication code (HMAC) of the string to sign. 


In AWS Signature Version 4, you don't use your secret access key to sign the request.
 Instead, you first use your secret access key to derive a signing key.
 
 The derived signing key is specific to the date, service, and Region. For more information about how to derive a signing key in different programming languages, see [Examples of how to derive a signing key for Signature Version 4](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-v4-examples.html "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-v4-examples.html").
 
 


The following diagram illustrates the general process of computing a signature.



![Diagram showing three-step process for computing a signature using StringToSign and signing key.](../../../images/AmazonS3/latest/API/images/signing-overview.png)

The string to sign depends on the request type. For example, when you use the HTTP
 Authorization header or the query parameters for authentication, you use a varying
 combination of request elements to create the string to sign. For an HTTP POST request,
 the POST policy in the request is the string you sign. For more information about
 computing string to sign, follow links provided at the end of this section.


For signing key, the diagram shows series of calculations, where result of each step you
 feed into the next step. The final step is the signing key.


Upon receiving an authenticated request, Amazon S3 servers re-create the signature by using
 the authentication information that is contained in the request. If the signatures
 match, Amazon S3 processes your request; otherwise, the request is rejected.
