# HeadObject

The `HEAD` operation retrieves metadata from an object without returning the object
 itself. This operation is useful if you're interested only in an object's metadata.

###### Note

A `HEAD` request has the same options as a `GET` operation on an object. The
 response is identical to the `GET` response except that there is no response body. Because
 of this, if the `HEAD` request generates an error, it returns a generic code, such as
 `400 Bad Request`, `403 Forbidden`, `404 Not Found`, `405
 Method Not Allowed`, `412 Precondition Failed`, or `304 Not Modified`.
 It's not possible to retrieve the exact exception of these error codes.

Request headers are limited to 8 KB in size. For more information, see [Common Request Headers](RESTCommonRequestHeaders.md "RESTCommonRequestHeaders.md").



Permissions



* **General purpose bucket permissions** - To use
 `HEAD`, you must have the `s3:GetObject` permission. You need the
 relevant read object (or version) permission for this operation. For more information, see
 [Actions, resources,
 and condition keys for Amazon S3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/list_amazons3.html "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/list_amazons3.html") in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*. For more
 information about the permissions to S3 API operations by S3 resource types, see [Required permissions for
 Amazon S3 API operations](../userguide/using-with-s3-policy-actions.md "../userguide/using-with-s3-policy-actions.md") in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.


If the object you request doesn't exist, the error that Amazon S3 returns depends on whether
 you also have the `s3:ListBucket` permission.




	+ If you have the `s3:ListBucket` permission on the bucket, Amazon S3 returns an
	 HTTP status code `404 Not Found` error.
	+ If you don’t have the `s3:ListBucket` permission, Amazon S3 returns an HTTP
	 status code `403 Forbidden` error.
* **Directory bucket permissions** - To grant access to this API operation on a directory bucket, we recommend that you use the [`CreateSession`](API_CreateSession.md "API_CreateSession.md") API operation for session-based authorization. Specifically, you grant the `s3express:CreateSession` permission to the directory bucket in a bucket policy or an IAM identity-based policy. Then, you make the `CreateSession` API call on the bucket to obtain a session token. With the session token in your request header, you can make API requests to this operation. After the session token expires, you make another `CreateSession` API call to generate a new session token for use. 
AWS CLI or SDKs create session and refresh the session token automatically to avoid service interruptions when a session expires. For more information about authorization, see [`CreateSession`](API_CreateSession.md "API_CreateSession.md").


If you enable `x-amz-checksum-mode` in the request and the object is encrypted
 with AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS), you must also have the
 `kms:GenerateDataKey` and `kms:Decrypt` permissions in IAM
 identity-based policies and AWS KMS key policies for the AWS KMS key to retrieve the checksum of
 the object.


Encryption

###### Note

Encryption request headers, like `x-amz-server-side-encryption`, should not be
 sent for `HEAD` requests if your object uses server-side encryption with AWS Key Management Service
 (AWS KMS) keys (SSE-KMS), dual-layer server-side encryption with AWS KMS keys (DSSE-KMS), or
 server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed encryption keys (SSE-S3). The
 `x-amz-server-side-encryption` header is used when you `PUT` an object
 to S3 and want to specify the encryption method. If you include this header in a
 `HEAD` request for an object that uses these types of keys, you’ll get an HTTP
 `400 Bad Request` error. It's because the encryption method can't be changed when
 you retrieve the object.


If you encrypt an object by using server-side encryption with customer-provided encryption
 keys (SSE-C) when you store the object in Amazon S3, then when you retrieve the metadata from the
 object, you must use the following headers to provide the encryption key for the server to be able
 to retrieve the object's metadata. The headers are: 



* `x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm`
* `x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key`
* `x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key-MD5`

For more information about SSE-C, see [Server-Side Encryption (Using
 Customer-Provided Encryption Keys)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/ServerSideEncryptionCustomerKeys.html "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/ServerSideEncryptionCustomerKeys.html") in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.


###### Note


**Directory bucket**  -
 For directory buckets, there are only two supported options for server-side encryption: SSE-S3 and SSE-KMS. SSE-C isn't supported. For more
 information, see [Protecting data with server-side encryption](../userguide/s3-express-serv-side-encryption.md "../userguide/s3-express-serv-side-encryption.md") in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*. 



Versioning


* If the current version of the object is a delete marker, Amazon S3 behaves as if the object was
 deleted and includes `x-amz-delete-marker: true` in the response.
* If the specified version is a delete marker, the response returns a `405 Method Not
 Allowed` error and the `Last-Modified: timestamp` response header.

###### Note


* **Directory buckets** -
 Delete marker is not supported for directory buckets.
* **Directory buckets** -
 S3 Versioning isn't enabled and supported for directory buckets. For this API operation, only the `null` value of the version ID is supported by directory buckets. You can only specify `null` to the
 `versionId` query parameter in the request.


HTTP Host header syntax


**Directory buckets**  - The HTTP Host header syntax is `*Bucket-name*.s3express-*zone-id*.*region-code*.amazonaws.com`.


###### Note

For directory buckets, you must make requests for this API operation to the Zonal endpoint. These endpoints support virtual-hosted-style requests in the format `https://*amzn-s3-demo-bucket*.s3express-*zone-id*.*region-code*.amazonaws.com/*key-name*`. Path-style requests are not supported. For more information about endpoints in Availability Zones, see [Regional and Zonal endpoints for directory buckets in Availability Zones](../userguide/endpoint-directory-buckets-AZ.md "../userguide/endpoint-directory-buckets-AZ.md") in the
 *Amazon S3 User Guide*. For more information about endpoints in Local Zones, see [Concepts for directory buckets in Local Zones](../userguide/s3-lzs-for-directory-buckets.md "../userguide/s3-lzs-for-directory-buckets.md") in the
 *Amazon S3 User Guide*.



The following actions are related to `HeadObject`:


* [GetObject](API_GetObject.md "API_GetObject.md")
* [GetObjectAttributes](API_GetObjectAttributes.md "API_GetObjectAttributes.md")
###### Important

You must URL encode any signed header values that contain spaces. For example, if your header value is `my file.txt`, containing two spaces after `my`, you must URL encode this value to `my%20%20file.txt`.

## URI Request Parameters


The request uses the following URI parameters.





**[Bucket](#API_HeadObject_RequestSyntax "#API_HeadObject_RequestSyntax")**


The name of the bucket that contains the object.



**Directory buckets** - When you use this operation with a directory bucket, you must use virtual-hosted-style requests in the format `*Bucket-name*.s3express-*zone-id*.*region-code*.amazonaws.com`. Path-style requests are not supported. Directory bucket names must be unique in the chosen Zone (Availability Zone or Local Zone). Bucket names must follow the format `*bucket-base-name*--*zone-id*--x-s3` (for example, `*amzn-s3-demo-bucket*--*usw2-az1*--x-s3`). For information about bucket naming
 restrictions, see [Directory bucket naming
 rules](../userguide/directory-bucket-naming-rules.md "../userguide/directory-bucket-naming-rules.md") in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.



**Access points** - When you use this action with an access point for general purpose buckets, you must provide the alias of the access point in place of the bucket name or specify the access point ARN. When you use this action with an access point for directory buckets, you must provide the access point name in place of the bucket name. When using the access point ARN, you must direct requests to the access point hostname. The access point hostname takes the form *AccessPointName*-*AccountId*.s3-accesspoint.*Region*.amazonaws.com. When using this action with an access point through the AWS SDKs, you provide the access point ARN in place of the bucket name. For more information about access point ARNs, see [Using access points](../userguide/using-access-points.md "../userguide/using-access-points.md") in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.


###### Note

Object Lambda access points are not supported by directory buckets.



**S3 on Outposts** - When you use this action with S3 on Outposts, you must direct requests to the S3 on Outposts hostname. The S3 on Outposts hostname takes the 
 form `*AccessPointName*-*AccountId*.*outpostID*.s3-outposts.*Region*.amazonaws.com`. When you use this action with S3 on Outposts, the destination bucket must be the Outposts access point ARN or the access point alias. For more information about S3 on Outposts, see [What is S3 on Outposts?](../userguide/S3onOutposts.md "../userguide/S3onOutposts.md") in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

**[x-amz-checksum-mode](#API_HeadObject_RequestSyntax "#API_HeadObject_RequestSyntax")**


To retrieve the checksum, this parameter must be enabled.



**General purpose buckets** -
 If you enable checksum mode and the object is uploaded with a [checksum](API_Checksum.md "API_Checksum.md") and encrypted with
 an AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) key, you must have permission to use the `kms:Decrypt` action to
 retrieve the checksum.



**Directory buckets** - If you enable `ChecksumMode`
 and the object is encrypted with AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS), you must also have the
 `kms:GenerateDataKey` and `kms:Decrypt` permissions in IAM identity-based
 policies and AWS KMS key policies for the AWS KMS key to retrieve the checksum of the object.


Valid Values: `ENABLED`





**[x-amz-expected-bucket-owner](#API_HeadObject_RequestSyntax "#API_HeadObject_RequestSyntax")**


The account ID of the expected bucket owner. If the account ID that you provide does not match the actual owner of the bucket, the request fails with the HTTP status code `403 Forbidden` (access denied).




**[x-amz-request-payer](#API_HeadObject_RequestSyntax "#API_HeadObject_RequestSyntax")**


Confirms that the requester knows that they will be charged for the request. Bucket owners need not
 specify this parameter in their requests. If either the source or destination S3 bucket has Requester
 Pays enabled, the requester will pay for corresponding charges to copy the object. For information about
 downloading objects from Requester Pays buckets, see [Downloading Objects in Requester Pays
 Buckets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/ObjectsinRequesterPaysBuckets.html "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/ObjectsinRequesterPaysBuckets.html") in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

Specifies the algorithm to use when encrypting the object (for example, AES256).


###### Note

This functionality is not supported for directory buckets.




**[x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key](#API_HeadObject_RequestSyntax "#API_HeadObject_RequestSyntax")**


Specifies the customer-provided encryption key for Amazon S3 to use in encrypting data. This value is
 used to store the object and then it is discarded; Amazon S3 does not store the encryption key. The key must
 be appropriate for use with the algorithm specified in the
 `x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm` header.


###### Note

This functionality is not supported for directory buckets.




**[x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key-MD5](#API_HeadObject_RequestSyntax "#API_HeadObject_RequestSyntax")**


Specifies the 128-bit MD5 digest of the encryption key according to RFC 1321. Amazon S3 uses this header
 for a message integrity check to ensure that the encryption key was transmitted without error.


###### Note

This functionality is not supported for directory buckets.

 checksum for multipart objects. You can use this header response to verify that the checksum type that
 is received is the same checksum type that was specified in `CreateMultipartUpload` request.
 For more information, see [Checking object integrity in the Amazon S3
 User Guide](../userguide/checking-object-integrity.md "../userguide/checking-object-integrity.md").


Valid Values: `COMPOSITE | FULL_OBJECT`





**[x-amz-delete-marker](#API_HeadObject_ResponseSyntax "#API_HeadObject_ResponseSyntax")**


Specifies whether the object retrieved was (true) or was not (false) a Delete Marker. If false, this
 response header does not appear in the response.


###### Note

**[x-amz-expiration](#API_HeadObject_ResponseSyntax "#API_HeadObject_ResponseSyntax")**


If the object expiration is configured (see [`PutBucketLifecycleConfiguration`](API_PutBucketLifecycleConfiguration.md "API_PutBucketLifecycleConfiguration.md")), the response includes this header. It
 includes the `expiry-date` and `rule-id` key-value pairs providing object
 expiration information. The value of the `rule-id` is URL-encoded.


###### Note

Object expiration information is not returned in directory buckets and this header returns the
 value "`NotImplemented`" in all responses for directory buckets.




**[x-amz-missing-meta](#API_HeadObject_ResponseSyntax "#API_HeadObject_ResponseSyntax")**


This is set to the number of metadata entries not returned in `x-amz-meta` headers. This
 can happen if you create metadata using an API like SOAP that supports more flexible metadata than the
 REST API. For example, using SOAP, you can create metadata whose values are not legal HTTP
 headers.


###### Note

This functionality is not supported for directory buckets.




**[x-amz-mp-parts-count](#API_HeadObject_ResponseSyntax "#API_HeadObject_ResponseSyntax")**


The count of parts this object has. This value is only returned if you specify
 `partNumber` in your request and the object was uploaded as a multipart upload.




**[x-amz-object-lock-legal-hold](#API_HeadObject_ResponseSyntax "#API_HeadObject_ResponseSyntax")**


Specifies whether a legal hold is in effect for this object. This header is only returned if the
 requester has the `s3:GetObjectLegalHold` permission. This header is not returned if the
 specified version of this object has never had a legal hold applied. For more information about S3
 Object Lock, see [Object
 Lock](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/object-lock.html "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/object-lock.html").


###### Note

This functionality is not supported for directory buckets.

 requester has the `s3:GetObjectRetention` permission.


###### Note

This functionality is not supported for directory buckets.




**[x-amz-replication-status](#API_HeadObject_ResponseSyntax "#API_HeadObject_ResponseSyntax")**


Amazon S3 can return this header if your request involves a bucket that is either a source or a
 destination in a replication rule.


In replication, you have a source bucket on which you configure replication and destination bucket
 or buckets where Amazon S3 stores object replicas. When you request an object (`GetObject`) or
 object metadata (`HeadObject`) from these buckets, Amazon S3 will return the
 `x-amz-replication-status` header in the response as follows:



* **If requesting an object from the source bucket**, Amazon S3 will
 return the `x-amz-replication-status` header if the object in your request is eligible
 for replication.


 For example, suppose that in your replication configuration, you specify object prefix
 `TaxDocs` requesting Amazon S3 to replicate objects with key prefix `TaxDocs`.
 Any objects you upload with this key name prefix, for example `TaxDocs/document1.pdf`,
 are eligible for replication. For any object request with this key name prefix, Amazon S3 will return the
 `x-amz-replication-status` header with value PENDING, COMPLETED or FAILED indicating
 object replication status.
* **If requesting an object from a destination bucket**, Amazon S3 will
 return the `x-amz-replication-status` header with value REPLICA if the object in your
 request is a replica that Amazon S3 created and there is no replica modification replication in
 progress.
* **When replicating objects to multiple destination buckets**, the
 `x-amz-replication-status` header acts differently. The header of the source object
 will only return a value of COMPLETED when replication is successful to all destinations. The header
 will remain at value PENDING until replication has completed for all destinations. If one or more
 destinations fails replication the header will return FAILED.

For more information, see [Replication](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/NotificationHowTo.html "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/NotificationHowTo.html").


###### Note

This functionality is not supported for directory buckets.


Valid Values: `COMPLETE | PENDING | FAILED | REPLICA | COMPLETED`





**[x-amz-request-charged](#API_HeadObject_ResponseSyntax "#API_HeadObject_ResponseSyntax")**


If present, indicates that the requester was successfully charged for the request. For more
 information, see [Using Requester Pays buckets for storage transfers and usage](../userguide/RequesterPaysBuckets.md "../userguide/RequesterPaysBuckets.md") in the *Amazon Simple
 Storage Service user guide*.


###### Note

This functionality is not supported for directory buckets.


Valid Values: `requester`





**[x-amz-restore](#API_HeadObject_ResponseSyntax "#API_HeadObject_ResponseSyntax")**


If the object is an archived object (an object whose storage class is GLACIER), the response
 includes this header if either the archive restoration is in progress (see [RestoreObject](API_RestoreObject.md "API_RestoreObject.md") or an archive copy is already
 restored.


 If an archive copy is already restored, the header value indicates when Amazon S3 is scheduled to delete
 the object copy. For example:



`x-amz-restore: ongoing-request="false", expiry-date="Fri, 21 Dec 2012 00:00:00
 GMT"`



If the object restoration is in progress, the header returns the value
 `ongoing-request="true"`.


For more information about archiving objects, see [Transitioning Objects: General Considerations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/object-lifecycle-mgmt.html#lifecycle-transition-general-considerations "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/object-lifecycle-mgmt.html#lifecycle-transition-general-considerations").

**[x-amz-server-side-encryption](#API_HeadObject_ResponseSyntax "#API_HeadObject_ResponseSyntax")**


The server-side encryption algorithm used when you store this object in Amazon S3 or Amazon FSx.


###### Note

When accessing data stored in Amazon FSx file systems using S3 access points, the only valid server side
 encryption option is `aws:fsx`.


Valid Values: `AES256 | aws:fsx | aws:kms | aws:kms:dsse`





**[x-amz-server-side-encryption-aws-kms-key-id](#API_HeadObject_ResponseSyntax "#API_HeadObject_ResponseSyntax")**


If present, indicates the ID of the KMS key that was used for object encryption.




**[x-amz-server-side-encryption-bucket-key-enabled](#API_HeadObject_ResponseSyntax "#API_HeadObject_ResponseSyntax")**


Indicates whether the object uses an S3 Bucket Key for server-side encryption with AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS)
 keys (SSE-KMS).




**[x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm](#API_HeadObject_ResponseSyntax "#API_HeadObject_ResponseSyntax")**


If server-side encryption with a customer-provided encryption key was requested, the response will
 include this header to confirm the encryption algorithm that's used.


###### Note

This functionality is not supported for directory buckets.




**[x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key-MD5](#API_HeadObject_ResponseSyntax "#API_HeadObject_ResponseSyntax")**


If server-side encryption with a customer-provided encryption key was requested, the response will
 include this header to provide the round-trip message integrity verification of the customer-provided
 encryption key.


###### Note

This functionality is not supported for directory buckets.




**[x-amz-storage-class](#API_HeadObject_ResponseSyntax "#API_HeadObject_ResponseSyntax")**


Provides storage class information of the object. Amazon S3 returns this header for all objects except
 for S3 Standard storage class objects.


For more information, see [Storage Classes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/storage-class-intro.html "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/storage-class-intro.html").
