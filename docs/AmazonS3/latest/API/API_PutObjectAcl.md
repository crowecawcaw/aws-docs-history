# PutObjectAcl

###### Important

End of support notice: As of October 1, 2025, Amazon S3 has discontinued support for Email Grantee Access Control Lists (ACLs). If you attempt to use an Email Grantee ACL in a request after October 1, 2025, 
 the request will receive an `HTTP 405` (Method Not Allowed) error.

This change affects the following AWS Regions: US East (N. Virginia), US West (N. California), US West (Oregon), Asia Pacific (Singapore), Asia Pacific (Sydney), Asia Pacific (Tokyo), Europe (Ireland), and South America (São Paulo).

###### Note

This operation is not supported for directory buckets.

Uses the `acl` subresource to set the access control list (ACL) permissions for a new or
 existing object in an S3 bucket. You must have the `WRITE_ACP` permission to set the ACL of
 an object. For more information, see [What permissions can I grant?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html#permissions "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html#permissions") in the
 *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

This functionality is not supported for Amazon S3 on Outposts.

Depending on your application needs, you can choose to set the ACL on an object using either the
 request body or the headers. For example, if you have an existing application that updates a bucket ACL
 using the request body, you can continue to use that approach. For more information, see [Access Control List (ACL)
 Overview](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html") in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

###### Important

If your bucket uses the bucket owner enforced setting for S3 Object Ownership, ACLs are disabled
 and no longer affect permissions. You must use policies to grant access to your bucket and the objects
 in it. Requests to set ACLs or update ACLs fail and return the
 `AccessControlListNotSupported` error code. Requests to read ACLs are still supported.
 For more information, see [Controlling object ownership](../userguide/about-object-ownership.md "../userguide/about-object-ownership.md") in
 the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.



Permissions

You can set access permissions using one of the following methods:



* Specify a canned ACL with the `x-amz-acl` request header. Amazon S3 supports a set
 of predefined ACLs, known as canned ACLs. Each canned ACL has a predefined set of grantees and
 permissions. Specify the canned ACL name as the value of `x-amz-ac`l. If you use
 this header, you cannot use other access control-specific headers in your request. For more
 information, see [Canned ACL](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html#CannedACL "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html#CannedACL").
* Specify access permissions explicitly with the `x-amz-grant-read`,
 `x-amz-grant-read-acp`, `x-amz-grant-write-acp`, and
 `x-amz-grant-full-control` headers. When using these headers, you specify
 explicit access permissions and grantees (AWS accounts or Amazon S3 groups) who will receive the
 permission. If you use these ACL-specific headers, you cannot use `x-amz-acl`
 header to set a canned ACL. These parameters map to the set of permissions that Amazon S3 supports
 in an ACL. For more information, see [Access Control List (ACL)
 Overview](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html").


You specify each grantee as a type=value pair, where the type is one of the
 following:




	+ `id` – if the value specified is the canonical user ID of an
	 AWS account
	+ `uri` – if you are granting permissions to a predefined group
	+ `emailAddress` – if the value specified is the email address of an
	 AWS account
	 
	
	
	###### Note
	
	Using email addresses to specify a grantee is only supported in the following AWS Regions: 
	
	
	
		- US East (N. Virginia)
		- US West (N. California)
		- US West (Oregon)
		- Asia Pacific (Singapore)
		- Asia Pacific (Sydney)
		- Asia Pacific (Tokyo)
		- Europe (Ireland)
		- South America (São Paulo)For a list of all the Amazon S3 supported Regions and endpoints, see [Regions and Endpoints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#s3_region "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#s3_region") in the AWS General Reference.
For example, the following `x-amz-grant-read` header grants list objects
 permission to the two AWS accounts identified by their email addresses.



`x-amz-grant-read: emailAddress="xyz@amazon.com", emailAddress="abc@amazon.com"`

You can use either a canned ACL or specify access permissions explicitly. You cannot do
 both.



Grantee Values

You can specify the person (grantee) to whom you're assigning access rights (using request
 elements) in the following ways. For examples of how to specify these grantee values in JSON
 format, see the AWS CLI example in  [Enabling Amazon S3 server
 access logging](../userguide/enable-server-access-logging.md "../userguide/enable-server-access-logging.md") in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.



* By the person's ID:



`<Grantee xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
 xsi:type="CanonicalUser"><ID><>ID<></ID><DisplayName><>GranteesEmail<></DisplayName>
 </Grantee>`



DisplayName is optional and ignored in the request.
* By URI:



`<Grantee xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
 xsi:type="Group"><URI><>http://acs.amazonaws.com/groups/global/AuthenticatedUsers<></URI></Grantee>`
* By Email address:



`<Grantee xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
 xsi:type="AmazonCustomerByEmail"><EmailAddress><>Grantees@email.com<></EmailAddress>lt;/Grantee>`



The grantee is resolved to the CanonicalUser and, in a response to a GET Object acl
 request, appears as the CanonicalUser.


###### Note

Using email addresses to specify a grantee is only supported in the following AWS Regions: 



	+ US East (N. Virginia)
	+ US West (N. California)
	+ US West (Oregon)
	+ Asia Pacific (Singapore)
	+ Asia Pacific (Sydney)
	+ Asia Pacific (Tokyo)
	+ Europe (Ireland)
	+ South America (São Paulo)For a list of all the Amazon S3 supported Regions and endpoints, see [Regions and Endpoints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#s3_region "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#s3_region") in the AWS General Reference.


Versioning

The ACL of an object is set at the object version level. By default, PUT sets the ACL of the
 current version of an object. To set the ACL of a different version, use the
 `versionId` subresource.



The following operations are related to `PutObjectAcl`:


* [CopyObject](API_CopyObject.md "API_CopyObject.md")
* [GetObject](API_GetObject.md "API_GetObject.md")
###### Important

You must URL encode any signed header values that contain spaces. For example, if your header value is `my file.txt`, containing two spaces after `my`, you must URL encode this value to `my%20%20file.txt`.

## URI Request Parameters


The request uses the following URI parameters.





**[Bucket](#API_PutObjectAcl_RequestSyntax "#API_PutObjectAcl_RequestSyntax")**


The bucket name that contains the object to which you want to attach the ACL. 



**Access points** - When you use this action with an access point for general purpose buckets, you must provide the alias of the access point in place of the bucket name or specify the access point ARN. When you use this action with an access point for directory buckets, you must provide the access point name in place of the bucket name. When using the access point ARN, you must direct requests to the access point hostname. The access point hostname takes the form *AccessPointName*-*AccountId*.s3-accesspoint.*Region*.amazonaws.com. When using this action with an access point through the AWS SDKs, you provide the access point ARN in place of the bucket name. For more information about access point ARNs, see [Using access points](../userguide/using-access-points.md "../userguide/using-access-points.md") in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.



**S3 on Outposts** - When you use this action with S3 on Outposts, you must direct requests to the S3 on Outposts hostname. The S3 on Outposts hostname takes the 
 form `*AccessPointName*-*AccountId*.*outpostID*.s3-outposts.*Region*.amazonaws.com`. When you use this action with S3 on Outposts, the destination bucket must be the Outposts access point ARN or the access point alias. For more information about S3 on Outposts, see [What is S3 on Outposts?](../userguide/S3onOutposts.md "../userguide/S3onOutposts.md") in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.


Required: Yes




**[Content-MD5](#API_PutObjectAcl_RequestSyntax "#API_PutObjectAcl_RequestSyntax")**


The Base64 encoded 128-bit `MD5` digest of the data. This header must be used as a
 message integrity check to verify that the request body was not corrupted in transit. For more
 information, go to [RFC 1864.>](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1864.txt "http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1864.txt")



For requests made using the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) or AWS SDKs, this field is calculated automatically.




**[Key](#API_PutObjectAcl_RequestSyntax "#API_PutObjectAcl_RequestSyntax")**


Key for which the PUT action was initiated.


Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1.


Required: Yes




**[versionId](#API_PutObjectAcl_RequestSyntax "#API_PutObjectAcl_RequestSyntax")**


Version ID used to reference a specific version of the object.


###### Note

This functionality is not supported for directory buckets.




**[x-amz-acl](#API_PutObjectAcl_RequestSyntax "#API_PutObjectAcl_RequestSyntax")**


The canned ACL to apply to the object. For more information, see [Canned ACL](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html#CannedACL "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html#CannedACL").


Valid Values: `private | public-read | public-read-write | authenticated-read | aws-exec-read | bucket-owner-read | bucket-owner-full-control`





**[x-amz-expected-bucket-owner](#API_PutObjectAcl_RequestSyntax "#API_PutObjectAcl_RequestSyntax")**


The account ID of the expected bucket owner. If the account ID that you provide does not match the actual owner of the bucket, the request fails with the HTTP status code `403 Forbidden` (access denied).




**[x-amz-grant-full-control](#API_PutObjectAcl_RequestSyntax "#API_PutObjectAcl_RequestSyntax")**


Allows grantee the read, write, read ACP, and write ACP permissions on the bucket.


This functionality is not supported for Amazon S3 on Outposts.




**[x-amz-grant-read](#API_PutObjectAcl_RequestSyntax "#API_PutObjectAcl_RequestSyntax")**


Allows grantee to list the objects in the bucket.


This functionality is not supported for Amazon S3 on Outposts.




**[x-amz-grant-read-acp](#API_PutObjectAcl_RequestSyntax "#API_PutObjectAcl_RequestSyntax")**


Allows grantee to read the bucket ACL.


This functionality is not supported for Amazon S3 on Outposts.




**[x-amz-grant-write](#API_PutObjectAcl_RequestSyntax "#API_PutObjectAcl_RequestSyntax")**


Allows grantee to create new objects in the bucket.


For the bucket and object owners of existing objects, also allows deletions and overwrites of those
 objects.




**[x-amz-grant-write-acp](#API_PutObjectAcl_RequestSyntax "#API_PutObjectAcl_RequestSyntax")**


Allows grantee to write the ACL for the applicable bucket.


This functionality is not supported for Amazon S3 on Outposts.




**[x-amz-request-payer](#API_PutObjectAcl_RequestSyntax "#API_PutObjectAcl_RequestSyntax")**


Confirms that the requester knows that they will be charged for the request. Bucket owners need not
 specify this parameter in their requests. If either the source or destination S3 bucket has Requester
 Pays enabled, the requester will pay for corresponding charges to copy the object. For information about
 downloading objects from Requester Pays buckets, see [Downloading Objects in Requester Pays
 Buckets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/ObjectsinRequesterPaysBuckets.html "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/ObjectsinRequesterPaysBuckets.html") in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.


###### Note

This functionality is not supported for directory buckets.


Valid Values: `requester`





**[x-amz-sdk-checksum-algorithm](#API_PutObjectAcl_RequestSyntax "#API_PutObjectAcl_RequestSyntax")**


Indicates the algorithm used to create the checksum for the object when you use the SDK. This header will not provide any
 additional functionality if you don't use the SDK. When you send this header, there must be a corresponding `x-amz-checksum` or
 `x-amz-trailer` header sent. Otherwise, Amazon S3 fails the request with the HTTP status code `400 Bad Request`. For more
 information, see [Checking object integrity](../userguide/checking-object-integrity.md "../userguide/checking-object-integrity.md") in
 the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.
