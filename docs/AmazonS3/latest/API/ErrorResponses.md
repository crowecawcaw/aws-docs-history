# Error responses

This section provides reference information about Amazon S3 errors.

###### Note


* In general, S3 bucket owners are billed for requests with 
 HTTP `200 OK` successful responses and HTTP `4XX` client error responses. Bucket owners aren't billed for HTTP `5XX` server error responses, such as HTTP `503 Slow Down` errors. 
 For more information on S3 error codes under HTTP `3XX` and `4XX` status codes that aren't billed, see [Billing for Amazon S3 error responses](../userguide/ErrorCodeBilling.md "../userguide/ErrorCodeBilling.md") in the Amazon S3 User Guide. For more information about billing charges if your bucket is configured as a Requester Pays bucket, see [How Requester Pays charges work](../userguide/RequesterPaysBuckets.md#ChargeDetails "../userguide/RequesterPaysBuckets.md#ChargeDetails") in the Amazon S3 User Guide.
* SOAP support over HTTP is deprecated, but SOAP is still available over HTTPS. 
 New Amazon S3 features are not supported for SOAP. Instead of using SOAP, we recommend that you use 
 either the REST API or the AWS SDKs.

## REST error responses


When an error occurs, the header information contains the following:



* Content-Type: application/xml
* An appropriate 3xx, 4xx, or 5xx HTTP status code

The body of the response also contains information about the error. The following sample
 error response shows the structure of response elements common to all REST error
 responses.



```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<Error>
  <Code>NoSuchKey</Code>
  <Message>The resource you requested does not exist</Message>
  <Resource>/mybucket/myfoto.jpg</Resource> 
  <RequestId>4442587FB7D0A2F9</RequestId>
</Error>
```

The following table explains the REST error response elements.




|  Name  |  Description  |
| --- | --- |
| `Code` | The error code is a string that uniquely identifies an error
 condition. It is meant to be read and understood by programs that
 detect and handle errors by type. For more information, see [List of error codes](#ErrorCodeList "#ErrorCodeList").
Type: String
Ancestor: `Error` |
| `Error` | Container for all error elements.
Type: Container
Ancestor: None |
| `Message` | The error message contains a generic description of the error
 condition in English. It is intended for a human audience. Simple
 programs display the message directly to the end user if they
 encounter an error condition they don't know how or don't care to
 handle. Sophisticated programs with more exhaustive error handling
 and proper internationalization are more likely to ignore the error
 message.
Type: String
Ancestor: `Error` |
| `RequestId` | ID of the request associated with the error.
Type: String
Ancestor: `Error` |
| `Resource` | The bucket or object that is involved in the error.
Type: String
Ancestor: `Error` |


Many error responses contain additional structured data meant to be read and understood by a
 developer diagnosing programming errors. For example, if you send a Content-MD5 header
 with a REST PUT request that doesn't match the digest calculated on the server, you
 receive a `BadDigest` error. The error response also includes as detail
 elements the digest that the server calculated, and the digest that you told the server
 to expect. During development, you can use this information to diagnose the error. In
 production, a well-behaved program might include this information in its error
 log.

## List of error codes


The following table lists Amazon S3 error codes.




| Error code | Description | HTTP status code | SOAP fault code prefix |

 error in all AWS Regions except in the US East (N. Virginia) Region
 (us-east-1). For legacy compatibility, if you re-create an
 existing bucket that you already own in us-east-1, Amazon S3
 returns `200 OK` and resets the bucket access control lists
 (ACLs). For Amazon S3 on Outposts, the bucket that you tried to create
 already exists in your Outpost and you own it.  | `409 Conflict` (in all Regions except

## List of Amazon S3 Object Lambda error
 codes


The following table contains special errors that S3 Object Lambda might return. For
 information about general Amazon S3 errors and a list of error codes, see [Error responses](ErrorResponses.md "ErrorResponses.md").


Error responses received from the supporting access points during non-`GetObject`
 requests are sent to the caller unaltered.




| Error code | Description | HTTP status code |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `LambdaInvalidResponse` | Returned to the original caller when
 `WriteGetObjectResponse` responds with
 `ValidationError` to AWS Lambda.
See the `ValidationError` message for more details. Not
 all cases of `ValidationError` result in a
 `LambdaInvalidResponse` error. | `400 Bad Request` |
| `LambdaInvocationFailed` | Lambda function invocation failed.
Callers might receive the following error when S3 Object Lambda is
 unable to successfully invoke the configured Lambda function.
The error message might contain details about an eventual error
 returned by the AWS Lambda service when invoking the function (for
 example, status code, error code, error message and request
 ID). | `400 Bad Request` |
| `LambdaNotFound` | The AWS Lambda function was not found.The
 configured Lambda function, version, or alias was not found when
 attempting to invoke it. Ensure that the S3 Object Lambda Access
 Point configuration points to the correct Lambda function
 ARN.The error message might contain details about an
 eventual error returned by the AWS Lambda service when invoking the
 function (for example, status code, error code, error message and
 request ID). | `404 Not Found` |
| `LambdaPermissionError` | The caller is not authorized to invoke the Lambda function.
The caller must have permission to invoke the Lambda function.
 Check the policies attached to the caller and ensure that they've
 been allowed to use `lambda:Invoke` for the configured
 function.
The error message might contain details about an eventual error
 returned by the AWS Lambda service when invoking the function (for
 example, status code, error code, error message and request
 ID). | `403 Forbidden` |
| `LambdaResponseNotReceived` | The Lambda function exited without successfully calling
 `WriteGetObjectResponse`.`GetObject`
 response data is provided by the Lambda function by calling the
 `WriteGetObjectResponse` API operation. The Amazon CloudWatch
 logs for the function might provide more insight into why the
 function did not successfully call this API operation despite
 exiting normally. | `500 Internal Service Error` |
| `LambdaRuntimeError` | The Lambda function failed during execution.An
 explicit error was received from the Lambda function. For details
 about the failure, check the AWS CloudFormation logs. | `500 Internal Service Error` |
| `LambdaTimeout` | The Lambda function did not respond in the allowed
 time.The Lambda function failed to complete its call to
 `WriteGetObjectResponse` within 60 seconds. | `500 Internal Service Error` |
| `SlowDown` | Reduce your request rate for operations involving
 AWS Lambda.The function invocation was throttled by
 AWS Lambda, perhaps because it has reached its configured concurrency
 limitation. For more information, see [Managing
 concurrency for a Lambda function](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/configuration-concurrency.html "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/configuration-concurrency.html") in the
 *AWS Lambda Developer Guide*.The error
 message might contain details about an eventual error returned by
 the AWS Lambda service when invoking the function (for example,
 status code, error code, error message and request ID). | `503 Slow Down` |
| `ValidationError` | Validation errors might be returned from the
 `WriteGetObjectResponse` API operation and can occur
