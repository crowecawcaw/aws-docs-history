# UploadPartCopy

Uploads a part by copying data from an existing object as data source. To specify the data source,
 you add the request header `x-amz-copy-source` in your request. To specify a byte range, you
 add the request header `x-amz-copy-source-range` in your request. 

For information about maximum and minimum part sizes and other multipart upload specifications, see
 [Multipart upload
 limits](../userguide/qfacts.md "../userguide/qfacts.md") in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*. 

###### Note

Instead of copying data from an existing object as part data, you might use the [UploadPart](API_UploadPart.md "API_UploadPart.md") action to
 upload new data as a part of an object in your request.

You must initiate a multipart upload before you can upload any part. In response to your initiate
 request, Amazon S3 returns the upload ID, a unique identifier that you must include in your upload part
 request.

For conceptual information about multipart uploads, see [Uploading Objects Using Multipart Upload](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/uploadobjusingmpu.html "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/uploadobjusingmpu.html") in
 the *Amazon S3 User Guide*. For information about copying objects using a single atomic
 action vs. a multipart upload, see [Operations on Objects](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/ObjectOperations.html "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/ObjectOperations.html") in the
 *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

###### Note


**Directory buckets** - For directory buckets, you must make requests for this API operation to the Zonal endpoint. These endpoints support virtual-hosted-style requests in the format `https://*amzn-s3-demo-bucket*.s3express-*zone-id*.*region-code*.amazonaws.com/*key-name*`. Path-style requests are not supported. For more information about endpoints in Availability Zones, see [Regional and Zonal endpoints for directory buckets in Availability Zones](../userguide/endpoint-directory-buckets-AZ.md "../userguide/endpoint-directory-buckets-AZ.md") in the
 *Amazon S3 User Guide*. For more information about endpoints in Local Zones, see [Concepts for directory buckets in Local Zones](../userguide/s3-lzs-for-directory-buckets.md "../userguide/s3-lzs-for-directory-buckets.md") in the
 *Amazon S3 User Guide*.



Authentication and authorization

All `UploadPartCopy` requests must be authenticated and signed by using IAM
 credentials (access key ID and secret access key for the IAM identities). All headers with the
 `x-amz-` prefix, including `x-amz-copy-source`, must be signed. For more
 information, see [REST Authentication](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/RESTAuthentication.html "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/RESTAuthentication.html").



**Directory buckets** - You must use IAM credentials to
 authenticate and authorize your access to the `UploadPartCopy` API operation, instead
 of using the temporary security credentials through the `CreateSession` API
 operation.



 AWS CLI or SDKs handles authentication and authorization on your behalf.



Permissions

You must have `READ` access to the source object and `WRITE` access to
 the destination bucket.



* **General purpose bucket permissions** - You must have the
 permissions in a policy based on the bucket types of your source bucket and destination bucket
 in an `UploadPartCopy` operation.




	+ If the source object is in a general purpose bucket, you must have the **`s3:GetObject`** permission to read the source object that is
	 being copied.
	+ If the destination bucket is a general purpose bucket, you must have the **`s3:PutObject`** permission to write the object copy to
	 the destination bucket.
	+ To perform a multipart upload with encryption using an AWS Key Management Service key, the requester
	 must have permission to the `kms:Decrypt` and `kms:GenerateDataKey`
	 actions on the key. The requester must also have permissions for the
	 `kms:GenerateDataKey` action for the `CreateMultipartUpload` API.
	 Then, the requester needs permissions for the `kms:Decrypt` action on the
	 `UploadPart` and `UploadPartCopy` APIs. These permissions are
	 required because Amazon S3 must decrypt and read data from the encrypted file parts before it
	 completes the multipart upload. For more information about KMS permissions, see [Protecting
	 data using server-side encryption with AWS KMS](../userguide/UsingKMSEncryption.md "../userguide/UsingKMSEncryption.md") in the
	 *Amazon S3 User Guide*. For information about the permissions required to
	 use the multipart upload API, see [Multipart upload and
	 permissions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/mpuAndPermissions.html "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/mpuAndPermissions.html") and [Multipart upload API
	 and permissions](../userguide/mpuoverview.md#mpuAndPermissions "../userguide/mpuoverview.md#mpuAndPermissions") in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.
* **Directory bucket permissions** - You must have
 permissions in a bucket policy or an IAM identity-based policy based on the source and destination bucket types
 in an `UploadPartCopy` operation.




	+ If the source object that you want to copy is in a directory bucket, you must have
	 the **`s3express:CreateSession`** permission in
	 the `Action` element of a policy to read the object. By default, the session is
	 in the `ReadWrite` mode. If you want to restrict the access, you can explicitly
	 set the `s3express:SessionMode` condition key to `ReadOnly` on the
	 copy source bucket.
	+ If the copy destination is a directory bucket, you must have the **`s3express:CreateSession`** permission in the
	 `Action` element of a policy to write the object to the destination. The
	 `s3express:SessionMode` condition key cannot be set to `ReadOnly`
	 on the copy destination.
If the object is encrypted with SSE-KMS, you must also have the
 `kms:GenerateDataKey` and `kms:Decrypt` permissions in IAM
 identity-based policies and AWS KMS key policies for the AWS KMS key.


For example policies, see [Example
 bucket policies for S3 Express One Zone](../userguide/s3-express-security-iam-example-bucket-policies.md "../userguide/s3-express-security-iam-example-bucket-policies.md") and [AWS
 Identity and Access Management (IAM) identity-based policies for S3 Express One Zone](../userguide/s3-express-security-iam-identity-policies.md "../userguide/s3-express-security-iam-identity-policies.md") in the
 *Amazon S3 User Guide*.


Encryption


* **General purpose buckets**  -
 For information about using server-side encryption with
 customer-provided encryption keys with the `UploadPartCopy` operation, see [CopyObject](API_CopyObject.md "API_CopyObject.md") and
 [UploadPart](API_UploadPart.md "API_UploadPart.md").
* **Directory buckets**  -
 For directory buckets, there are only two supported options for server-side encryption: server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3) (`AES256`) and server-side encryption with AWS KMS keys (SSE-KMS) (`aws:kms`). For more
 information, see [Protecting data with server-side encryption](../userguide/s3-express-serv-side-encryption.md "../userguide/s3-express-serv-side-encryption.md") in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.


###### Note

For directory buckets, when you perform a `CreateMultipartUpload` operation
 and an `UploadPartCopy` operation, the request headers you provide in the
 `CreateMultipartUpload` request must match the default encryption configuration
 of the destination bucket. 


S3 Bucket Keys aren't supported, when you copy SSE-KMS encrypted objects from general purpose buckets 
to directory buckets, from directory buckets to general purpose buckets, or between directory buckets, through [UploadPartCopy](API_UploadPartCopy.md "API_UploadPartCopy.md"). In this case, Amazon S3 makes a call to AWS KMS every time a copy request is made for a KMS-encrypted object.


Special errors


* Error Code: `NoSuchUpload`





	+ Description: The specified multipart upload does not exist. The upload ID might be
	 invalid, or the multipart upload might have been aborted or completed.
	+ HTTP Status Code: 404 Not Found
* Error Code: `InvalidRequest`





	+ Description: The specified copy source is not supported as a byte-range copy
	 source.
	+ HTTP Status Code: 400 Bad Request


HTTP Host header syntax


**Directory buckets**  - The HTTP Host header syntax is `*Bucket-name*.s3express-*zone-id*.*region-code*.amazonaws.com`.



The following operations are related to `UploadPartCopy`:


* [CreateMultipartUpload](API_CreateMultipartUpload.md "API_CreateMultipartUpload.md")
* [UploadPart](API_UploadPart.md "API_UploadPart.md")
* [CompleteMultipartUpload](API_CompleteMultipartUpload.md "API_CompleteMultipartUpload.md")
* [AbortMultipartUpload](API_AbortMultipartUpload.md "API_AbortMultipartUpload.md")
* [ListParts](API_ListParts.md "API_ListParts.md")
* [ListMultipartUploads](API_ListMultipartUploads.md "API_ListMultipartUploads.md")
###### Important

You must URL encode any signed header values that contain spaces. For example, if your header value is `my file.txt`, containing two spaces after `my`, you must URL encode this value to `my%20%20file.txt`.

## URI Request Parameters


The request uses the following URI parameters.





**[Bucket](#API_UploadPartCopy_RequestSyntax "#API_UploadPartCopy_RequestSyntax")**


The bucket name.



**Directory buckets** - When you use this operation with a directory bucket, you must use virtual-hosted-style requests in the format `*Bucket-name*.s3express-*zone-id*.*region-code*.amazonaws.com`. Path-style requests are not supported. Directory bucket names must be unique in the chosen Zone (Availability Zone or Local Zone). Bucket names must follow the format `*bucket-base-name*--*zone-id*--x-s3` (for example, `*amzn-s3-demo-bucket*--*usw2-az1*--x-s3`). For information about bucket naming
 restrictions, see [Directory bucket naming
 rules](../userguide/directory-bucket-naming-rules.md "../userguide/directory-bucket-naming-rules.md") in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.


###### Note

Copying objects across different AWS Regions isn't supported when the source or destination
 bucket is in AWS Local Zones. The source and destination buckets must have the same parent AWS Region.
 Otherwise, you get an HTTP `400 Bad Request` error with the error code
 `InvalidRequest`.



**Access points** - When you use this action with an access point for general purpose buckets, you must provide the alias of the access point in place of the bucket name or specify the access point ARN. When you use this action with an access point for directory buckets, you must provide the access point name in place of the bucket name. When using the access point ARN, you must direct requests to the access point hostname. The access point hostname takes the form *AccessPointName*-*AccountId*.s3-accesspoint.*Region*.amazonaws.com. When using this action with an access point through the AWS SDKs, you provide the access point ARN in place of the bucket name. For more information about access point ARNs, see [Using access points](../userguide/using-access-points.md "../userguide/using-access-points.md") in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.


###### Note

Object Lambda access points are not supported by directory buckets.



**S3 on Outposts** - When you use this action with S3 on Outposts, you must direct requests to the S3 on Outposts hostname. The S3 on Outposts hostname takes the 
 form `*AccessPointName*-*AccountId*.*outpostID*.s3-outposts.*Region*.amazonaws.com`. When you use this action with S3 on Outposts, the destination bucket must be the Outposts access point ARN or the access point alias. For more information about S3 on Outposts, see [What is S3 on Outposts?](../userguide/S3onOutposts.md "../userguide/S3onOutposts.md") in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.


Required: Yes




**[Key](#API_UploadPartCopy_RequestSyntax "#API_UploadPartCopy_RequestSyntax")**


Object key for which the multipart upload was initiated.


Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1.


Required: Yes




**[partNumber](#API_UploadPartCopy_RequestSyntax "#API_UploadPartCopy_RequestSyntax")**


Part number of part being copied. This is a positive integer between 1 and 10,000.


Required: Yes




**[uploadId](#API_UploadPartCopy_RequestSyntax "#API_UploadPartCopy_RequestSyntax")**


Upload ID identifying the multipart upload whose part is being copied.


Required: Yes




**[x-amz-copy-source](#API_UploadPartCopy_RequestSyntax "#API_UploadPartCopy_RequestSyntax")**


Specifies the source object for the copy operation. You specify the value in one of two formats,
 depending on whether you want to access the source object through an [access point](../userguide/access-points.md "../userguide/access-points.md"):



* For objects not accessed through an access point, specify the name of the source bucket and key of the
 source object, separated by a slash (/). For example, to copy the object
 `reports/january.pdf` from the bucket `awsexamplebucket`, use
 `awsexamplebucket/reports/january.pdf`. The value must be URL-encoded.
* For objects accessed through access points, specify the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the object as accessed through the access point, in the format `arn:aws:s3:<Region>:<account-id>:accesspoint/<access-point-name>/object/<key>`. For example, to copy the object `reports/january.pdf` through access point `my-access-point` owned by account `123456789012` in Region `us-west-2`, use the URL encoding of `arn:aws:s3:us-west-2:123456789012:accesspoint/my-access-point/object/reports/january.pdf`. The value must be URL encoded.


###### Note



	+ Amazon S3 supports copy operations using Access points only when the source and destination buckets are in the same AWS Region.
	+ Access points are not supported by directory buckets.
Alternatively, for objects accessed through Amazon S3 on Outposts, specify the ARN of the object as accessed in the format `arn:aws:s3-outposts:<Region>:<account-id>:outpost/<outpost-id>/object/<key>`. For example, to copy the object `reports/january.pdf` through outpost `my-outpost` owned by account `123456789012` in Region `us-west-2`, use the URL encoding of `arn:aws:s3-outposts:us-west-2:123456789012:outpost/my-outpost/object/reports/january.pdf`. The value must be URL-encoded.

If your bucket has versioning enabled, you could have multiple versions of the same object. By
 default, `x-amz-copy-source` identifies the current version of the source object to copy. To
 copy a specific version of the source object to copy, append `?versionId=<version-id>` to
 the `x-amz-copy-source` request header (for example, `x-amz-copy-source:
 /awsexamplebucket/reports/january.pdf?versionId=QUpfdndhfd8438MNFDN93jdnJFkdmqnh893`). 


If the current version is a delete marker and you don't specify a versionId in the
 `x-amz-copy-source` request header, Amazon S3 returns a `404 Not Found` error,
 because the object does not exist. If you specify versionId in the `x-amz-copy-source` and
 the versionId is a delete marker, Amazon S3 returns an HTTP `400 Bad Request` error, because you
 are not allowed to specify a delete marker as a version for the `x-amz-copy-source`. 


###### Note


**Directory buckets** - S3 Versioning isn't enabled and supported for directory buckets.


Pattern: `\/?.+\/.+`



Required: Yes




**[x-amz-copy-source-if-match](#API_UploadPartCopy_RequestSyntax "#API_UploadPartCopy_RequestSyntax")**


Copies the object if its entity tag (ETag) matches the specified tag.


If both of the `x-amz-copy-source-if-match` and
 `x-amz-copy-source-if-unmodified-since` headers are present in the request as
 follows:



`x-amz-copy-source-if-match` condition evaluates to `true`, and;



`x-amz-copy-source-if-unmodified-since` condition evaluates to `false`;


Amazon S3 returns `200 OK` and copies the data.
 




**[x-amz-copy-source-if-modified-since](#API_UploadPartCopy_RequestSyntax "#API_UploadPartCopy_RequestSyntax")**


Copies the object if it has been modified since the specified time.


If both of the `x-amz-copy-source-if-none-match` and
 `x-amz-copy-source-if-modified-since` headers are present in the request as follows:



`x-amz-copy-source-if-none-match` condition evaluates to `false`, and;



`x-amz-copy-source-if-modified-since` condition evaluates to `true`;


Amazon S3 returns `412 Precondition Failed` response code.
 




**[x-amz-copy-source-if-none-match](#API_UploadPartCopy_RequestSyntax "#API_UploadPartCopy_RequestSyntax")**


Copies the object if its entity tag (ETag) is different than the specified ETag.


If both of the `x-amz-copy-source-if-none-match` and
 `x-amz-copy-source-if-modified-since` headers are present in the request as follows:



`x-amz-copy-source-if-none-match` condition evaluates to `false`, and;



`x-amz-copy-source-if-modified-since` condition evaluates to `true`;


Amazon S3 returns `412 Precondition Failed` response code.
 




**[x-amz-copy-source-if-unmodified-since](#API_UploadPartCopy_RequestSyntax "#API_UploadPartCopy_RequestSyntax")**


Copies the object if it hasn't been modified since the specified time.


If both of the `x-amz-copy-source-if-match` and
 `x-amz-copy-source-if-unmodified-since` headers are present in the request as
 follows:



`x-amz-copy-source-if-match` condition evaluates to `true`, and;



`x-amz-copy-source-if-unmodified-since` condition evaluates to `false`;


Amazon S3 returns `200 OK` and copies the data.
 




**[x-amz-copy-source-range](#API_UploadPartCopy_RequestSyntax "#API_UploadPartCopy_RequestSyntax")**


The range of bytes to copy from the source object. The range value must use the form
 bytes=first-last, where the first and last are the zero-based byte offsets to copy. For example,
 bytes=0-9 indicates that you want to copy the first 10 bytes of the source. You can copy a range only if
 the source object is greater than 5 MB.




**[x-amz-copy-source-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm](#API_UploadPartCopy_RequestSyntax "#API_UploadPartCopy_RequestSyntax")**


Specifies the algorithm to use when decrypting the source object (for example,
 `AES256`).


###### Note

This functionality is not supported when the source object is in a directory bucket.




**[x-amz-copy-source-server-side-encryption-customer-key](#API_UploadPartCopy_RequestSyntax "#API_UploadPartCopy_RequestSyntax")**


Specifies the customer-provided encryption key for Amazon S3 to use to decrypt the source object. The
 encryption key provided in this header must be one that was used when the source object was
 created.


###### Note

This functionality is not supported when the source object is in a directory bucket.




**[x-amz-copy-source-server-side-encryption-customer-key-MD5](#API_UploadPartCopy_RequestSyntax "#API_UploadPartCopy_RequestSyntax")**

This functionality is not supported when the source object is in a directory bucket.




**[x-amz-expected-bucket-owner](#API_UploadPartCopy_RequestSyntax "#API_UploadPartCopy_RequestSyntax")**


The account ID of the expected destination bucket owner. If the account ID that you provide does not match the actual owner of the destination bucket, the request fails with the HTTP status code `403 Forbidden` (access denied).




**[x-amz-request-payer](#API_UploadPartCopy_RequestSyntax "#API_UploadPartCopy_RequestSyntax")**


Confirms that the requester knows that they will be charged for the request. Bucket owners need not
 specify this parameter in their requests. If either the source or destination S3 bucket has Requester
 Pays enabled, the requester will pay for corresponding charges to copy the object. For information about
 downloading objects from Requester Pays buckets, see [Downloading Objects in Requester Pays
 Buckets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/ObjectsinRequesterPaysBuckets.html "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/ObjectsinRequesterPaysBuckets.html") in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.
