## Archiving all objects within one day after creation


Each S3 Lifecycle rule includes a filter that you can use to identify a subset of
 objects in your bucket to which the S3 Lifecycle rule applies. The following S3 Lifecycle
 configurations show examples of how you can specify a filter.



* In this S3 Lifecycle configuration rule, the filter specifies a key prefix
 (`tax/`). Therefore, the rule applies to objects with the key
 name prefix `tax/`, such as `tax/doc1.txt` and
 `tax/doc2.txt`.


The rule specifies two actions that direct Amazon S3 to do the following:




	+ Transition objects to the S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval storage class 365
	 days (one year) after creation.
	+ Delete objects (the `Expiration` action) 3,650 days (10
	 years) after creation.

```
<LifecycleConfiguration>
  <Rule>
    <ID>Transition and Expiration Rule</ID>
    <Filter>
       <Prefix>tax/</Prefix>
    </Filter>
    <Status>Enabled</Status>
    <Transition>
      <Days>365</Days>
      <StorageClass>GLACIER</StorageClass>
    </Transition>
    <Expiration>
      <Days>3650</Days>
    </Expiration>
  </Rule>
</LifecycleConfiguration>
```

Instead of specifying the object age in terms of days after creation, you can
 specify a date for each action. However, you can't use both `Date`
 and `Days` in the same rule.
* If you want the S3 Lifecycle rule to apply to all objects in the bucket,
 specify an empty prefix. In the following configuration, the rule specifies a
 `Transition` action that directs Amazon S3 to transition objects to
 the S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval storage class 0 days after creation. This rule
 means that the objects are eligible for archival to S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval at midnight UTC
 following creation. For more information about lifecycle constraints, see [Constraints and considerations
 for transitions](lifecycle-transition-general-considerations.md#lifecycle-configuration-constraints "lifecycle-transition-general-considerations.md#lifecycle-configuration-constraints").



```
<LifecycleConfiguration>
  <Rule>
    <ID>Archive all object same-day upon creation</ID>
    <Filter>
      <Prefix></Prefix>
    </Filter>
    <Status>Enabled</Status>
    <Transition>
      <Days>0</Days>
      <StorageClass>GLACIER</StorageClass>
    </Transition>
  </Rule>
</LifecycleConfiguration>
```
* You can specify zero or one key name prefix and zero or more object tags in a
 filter. The following example code applies the S3 Lifecycle rule to a subset of
 objects with the `tax/` key prefix and to objects that have two tags
 with specific key and value. When you specify more than one filter, you must
 include the `<And>` element as shown (Amazon S3 applies a logical
 `AND` to combine the specified filter conditions).



```
...
<Filter>
   <And>
      <Prefix>tax/</Prefix>
      <Tag>
         <Key>key1</Key>
         <Value>value1</Value>
      </Tag>
      <Tag>
         <Key>key2</Key>
         <Value>value2</Value>
      </Tag>
    </And>
</Filter>
...
```
* You can filter objects based only on tags. For example, the following
 S3 Lifecycle rule applies to objects that have the two specified tags (it does
 not specify any prefix).



```
...
<Filter>
   <And>
      <Tag>
         <Key>key1</Key>
         <Value>value1</Value>
      </Tag>
      <Tag>
         <Key>key2</Key>
         <Value>value2</Value>
      </Tag>
    </And>
</Filter>
...
```

###### Important

When you have multiple rules in an S3 Lifecycle configuration, an object can become
 eligible for multiple S3 Lifecycle actions on the same day. In such cases, Amazon S3
 follows these general rules:


* Permanent deletion takes precedence over transition.
* Transition takes precedence over creation of [delete markers](DeleteMarker.md "DeleteMarker.md").
* When an object is eligible for both an S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval and
 S3 Standard-IA (or S3 One Zone-IA) transition, Amazon S3 chooses the
 S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval transition.
 For examples, see [Examples of overlapping filters and
 conflicting lifecycle actions](lifecycle-conflicts.md#lifecycle-config-conceptual-ex5 "lifecycle-conflicts.md#lifecycle-config-conceptual-ex5"). 



## Disabling Lifecycle
 rules temporarily


You can temporarily disable an S3 Lifecycle rule using the `status` element. This can be useful if you want to test new rules or troubleshoot issues with your configuration, without overwriting your existing rules. The following S3 Lifecycle
 configuration specifies two rules:



* Rule 1 directs Amazon S3 to transition objects with the `logs/` prefix
 to the S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval storage class soon after creation.
* Rule 2 directs Amazon S3 to transition objects with the `documents/`
 prefix to the S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval storage class soon after creation.

In the configuration, Rule 1 is enabled and Rule 2 is disabled. Amazon S3 ignores the disabled
 rule.



```
<LifecycleConfiguration>
  <Rule>
    <ID>Rule1</ID>
    <Filter>
      <Prefix>logs/</Prefix>
    </Filter>
    <Status>Enabled</Status>
    <Transition>
      <Days>0</Days>
      <StorageClass>GLACIER</StorageClass>
    </Transition>
  </Rule>
  <Rule>
    <ID>Rule2</ID>
    <Filter>
      <Prefix>documents/</Prefix>
    </Filter>
    <Status>Disabled</Status>
    <Transition>
      <Days>0</Days>
      <StorageClass>GLACIER</StorageClass>
    </Transition>
  </Rule>
</LifecycleConfiguration>
```

## Tiering down the storage class
 over an object's lifetime


In this example, you use S3 Lifecycle configuration to tier down the storage class of
 objects over their lifetime. Tiering down can help reduce storage costs. For more
 information about pricing, see [Amazon S3
 pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing/ "https://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing/").


The following S3 Lifecycle configuration specifies a rule that applies to objects with
 the key name prefix `logs/`. The rule specifies the following actions:



* Two transition actions:




	+ Transition objects to the S3 Standard-IA storage class 30 days after
	 creation.
	+ Transition objects to the S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval storage class 90
	 days after creation.
* One expiration action that directs Amazon S3 to delete objects a year after
 creation.


```
<LifecycleConfiguration>
  <Rule>
    <ID>example-id</ID>
    <Filter>
       <Prefix>logs/</Prefix>
    </Filter>
    <Status>Enabled</Status>
    <Transition>
      <Days>30</Days>
      <StorageClass>STANDARD_IA</StorageClass>
    </Transition>
    <Transition>
      <Days>90</Days>
      <StorageClass>GLACIER</StorageClass>
    </Transition>
    <Expiration>
      <Days>365</Days>
    </Expiration>
  </Rule>
</LifecycleConfiguration>
```

###### Note

You can use one rule to describe all S3 Lifecycle actions if all actions apply to
 the same set of objects (identified by the filter). Otherwise, you can add multiple
 rules with each specifying a different filter.


###### Important

When you have multiple rules in an S3 Lifecycle configuration, an object can become
 eligible for multiple S3 Lifecycle actions on the same day. In such cases, Amazon S3
 follows these general rules:


* Permanent deletion takes precedence over transition.
* Transition takes precedence over creation of [delete markers](DeleteMarker.md "DeleteMarker.md").
* When an object is eligible for both an S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval and
 S3 Standard-IA (or S3 One Zone-IA) transition, Amazon S3 chooses the
 S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval transition.
 For examples, see [Examples of overlapping filters and
 conflicting lifecycle actions](lifecycle-conflicts.md#lifecycle-config-conceptual-ex5 "lifecycle-conflicts.md#lifecycle-config-conceptual-ex5"). 


## Specifying multiple rules



You can specify multiple rules if you want different S3 Lifecycle actions of different
 objects. The following S3 Lifecycle configuration has two rules:



* Rule 1 applies to objects with the key name prefix `classA/`. It
 directs Amazon S3 to transition objects to the S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval storage
 class one year after creation and expire these objects 10 years after
 creation.
* Rule 2 applies to objects with key name prefix `classB/`. It
 directs Amazon S3 to transition objects to the S3 Standard-IA storage class 90 days
 after creation and delete them one year after creation.


```
<LifecycleConfiguration>
    <Rule>
        <ID>ClassADocRule</ID>
        <Filter>
           <Prefix>classA/</Prefix>        
        </Filter>
        <Status>Enabled</Status>
        <Transition>        
           <Days>365</Days>        
           <StorageClass>GLACIER</StorageClass>       
        </Transition>    
        <Expiration>
             <Days>3650</Days>
        </Expiration>
    </Rule>
    <Rule>
        <ID>ClassBDocRule</ID>
        <Filter>
            <Prefix>classB/</Prefix>
        </Filter>
        <Status>Enabled</Status>
        <Transition>        
           <Days>90</Days>        
           <StorageClass>STANDARD_IA</StorageClass>       
        </Transition>    
        <Expiration>
             <Days>365</Days>
        </Expiration>
    </Rule>
</LifecycleConfiguration>
```

## Specifying a lifecycle rule
 for a versioning-enabled bucket


Suppose that you have a versioning-enabled bucket, which means that for each object,
 you have a current version and zero or more noncurrent versions. (For more information
 about S3 Versioning, see [Retaining multiple versions of objects with S3 Versioning](Versioning.md "Versioning.md").) 


In the following example, you want to maintain one year's worth of history, and retain
 5 noncurrent versions. S3 Lifecycle configurations support keeping 1 to 100 versions of
 any object. Be aware that more than 5 newer noncurrent versions must exist before Amazon S3
 can expire a given version. Amazon S3 will permanently delete any additional noncurrent
 versions beyond the specified number to retain. For the deletion to occur, both the
 `NoncurrentDays` and the `NewerNoncurrentVersions` values must
 be exceeded.


To save storage costs, you want to move noncurrent versions to
 S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval 30 days after they become noncurrent (assuming that these
 noncurrent objects are cold data for which you don't need real-time access). In
 addition, you expect the frequency of access of the current versions to diminish 90 days
 after creation, so you might choose to move these objects to the S3 Standard-IA storage
 class.



```
<LifecycleConfiguration>
    <Rule>
        <ID>sample-rule</ID>
        <Filter>
           <Prefix></Prefix>
        </Filter>
        <Status>Enabled</Status>
        <Transition>
           <Days>90</Days>
           <StorageClass>STANDARD_IA</StorageClass>
        </Transition>
        <NoncurrentVersionTransition>      
            <NoncurrentDays>30</NoncurrentDays>      
            <StorageClass>GLACIER</StorageClass>   
        </NoncurrentVersionTransition>    
       <NoncurrentVersionExpiration>     
            <NewerNoncurrentVersions>5</NewerNoncurrentVersions>
            <NoncurrentDays>365</NoncurrentDays>    
       </NoncurrentVersionExpiration> 
    </Rule>
</LifecycleConfiguration>
```

## Removing expired object delete markers in a versioning-enabled bucket



A versioning-enabled bucket has one current version and zero or more noncurrent
 versions for each object. When you delete an object, note the following:



* If you don't specify a version ID in your delete request, Amazon S3 adds a delete
 marker instead of deleting the object. The current object version becomes
 noncurrent, and the delete marker becomes the current version.
* If you specify a version ID in your delete request, Amazon S3 deletes the object
 version permanently (a delete marker isn't created).
* A delete marker with zero noncurrent versions is referred to as an
 *expired object delete marker*.

This example shows a scenario that can create expired object delete markers in your
 bucket, and how you can use S3 Lifecycle configuration to direct Amazon S3 to remove the
 expired object delete markers.


Suppose that you write an S3 Lifecycle configuration that uses the
 `NoncurrentVersionExpiration` action to remove noncurrent versions 30
 days after they become noncurrent and to retain 10 noncurrent versions, as shown in the
 following example. Be aware that more than 10 newer noncurrent versions must exist
 before Amazon S3 can expire a given version. Amazon S3 will permanently delete any additional
 noncurrent versions beyond the specified number to retain. For the deletion to occur,
 both the `NoncurrentDays` and the `NewerNoncurrentVersions` values
 must be exceeded.



```
<LifecycleConfiguration>
    <Rule>
        ...
        <NoncurrentVersionExpiration>     
            <NewerNoncurrentVersions>10</NewerNoncurrentVersions>
            <NoncurrentDays>30</NoncurrentDays>    
        </NoncurrentVersionExpiration>
    </Rule>
</LifecycleConfiguration>
```

The `NoncurrentVersionExpiration` action doesn't apply to the current
 object versions. It removes only the noncurrent versions.


For current object versions, you have the following options to manage their lifetime,
 depending on whether the current object versions follow a well-defined lifecycle: 



* **The current object versions follow a well-defined
 lifecycle.**


In this case, you can use an S3 Lifecycle configuration with the
 `Expiration` action to direct Amazon S3 to remove the current
 versions, as shown in the following example.



```
<LifecycleConfiguration>
    <Rule>
        ...
        <Expiration>
           <Days>60</Days>
        </Expiration>
        <NoncurrentVersionExpiration>     
            <NewerNoncurrentVersions>10</NewerNoncurrentVersions>
            <NoncurrentDays>30</NoncurrentDays>    
        </NoncurrentVersionExpiration>
    </Rule>
</LifecycleConfiguration>
```

In this example, Amazon S3 removes current versions 60 days after they're created
 by adding a delete marker for each of the current object versions. This process
 makes the current version noncurrent, and the delete marker becomes the current
 version. For more information, see [Retaining multiple versions of objects with S3 Versioning](Versioning.md "Versioning.md"). 


###### Note

You can't specify both a `Days` and an
 `ExpiredObjectDeleteMarker` tag on the same rule. When you
 specify the `Days` tag, Amazon S3 automatically performs
 `ExpiredObjectDeleteMarker` cleanup when the delete markers
 are old enough to satisfy the age criteria. To clean up delete markers as
 soon as they become the only version, create a separate rule with only the
 `ExpiredObjectDeleteMarker` tag.


The `NoncurrentVersionExpiration` action in the same S3 Lifecycle
 configuration removes noncurrent objects 30 days after they become noncurrent.
 Thus, in this example, all object versions are permanently removed 90 days after
 object creation. Be aware that in this example, more than 10 newer noncurrent
 versions must exist before Amazon S3 can expire a given version. Amazon S3 will
 permanently delete any additional noncurrent versions beyond the specified
 number to retain. For the deletion to occur, both the
 `NoncurrentDays` and the `NewerNoncurrentVersions`
 values must be exceeded. 


Although expired object delete markers are created during this process, Amazon S3
 detects and removes the expired object delete markers for you.
* **The current object versions don't have a well-defined
 lifecycle.**



In this case, you might remove the objects manually when you don't need them,
 creating a delete marker with one or more noncurrent versions. If your
 S3 Lifecycle configuration with the `NoncurrentVersionExpiration`
 action removes all the noncurrent versions, you now have expired object delete
 markers.


Specifically for this scenario, S3 Lifecycle configuration provides an
 `Expiration` action that you can use to remove the expired object
 delete markers.




```
<LifecycleConfiguration>
    <Rule>
       <ID>Rule 1</ID>
        <Filter>
          <Prefix>logs/</Prefix>
        </Filter>
        <Status>Enabled</Status>
        <Expiration>
           <ExpiredObjectDeleteMarker>true</ExpiredObjectDeleteMarker>
        </Expiration>
        <NoncurrentVersionExpiration>     
            <NewerNoncurrentVersions>10</NewerNoncurrentVersions>
            <NoncurrentDays>30</NoncurrentDays>    
        </NoncurrentVersionExpiration>
    </Rule>
</LifecycleConfiguration>
```

By setting the `ExpiredObjectDeleteMarker` element to `true` in
 the `Expiration` action, you direct Amazon S3 to remove the expired object delete
 markers.


###### Note

When you use the `ExpiredObjectDeleteMarker` S3 Lifecycle action, the
 rule cannot specify a tag-based filter.


## Lifecycle configuration to abort multipart
 uploads


You can use the Amazon S3 multipart upload REST API operations to upload large objects in
 parts. For more information about multipart uploads, see [Uploading and copying objects using multipart upload in Amazon S3](mpuoverview.md "mpuoverview.md"). 


By using an S3 Lifecycle configuration, you can direct Amazon S3 to stop incomplete
 multipart uploads (identified by the key name prefix specified in the rule) if they
 aren't completed within a specified number of days after initiation. When Amazon S3 aborts a
 multipart upload, it deletes all the parts associated with the multipart upload. This
 process helps control your storage costs by ensuring that you don't have incomplete
 multipart uploads with parts that are stored in Amazon S3. 


###### Note

When you use the `AbortIncompleteMultipartUpload` S3 Lifecycle action,
 the rule cannot specify a tag-based filter.


The following is an example S3 Lifecycle configuration that specifies a rule with the
 `AbortIncompleteMultipartUpload` action. This action directs Amazon S3 to stop
 incomplete multipart uploads seven days after initiation.



```
<LifecycleConfiguration>
    <Rule>
        <ID>sample-rule</ID>
        <Filter>
           <Prefix>`SomeKeyPrefix`/</Prefix>
        </Filter>
        <Status>`rule-status`</Status>
        <AbortIncompleteMultipartUpload>
          <DaysAfterInitiation>7</DaysAfterInitiation>
        </AbortIncompleteMultipartUpload>
    </Rule>
</LifecycleConfiguration>
```

## Expiring noncurrent objects that have no data


You can create rules that transition objects based only on their size. You can specify
 a minimum size (`ObjectSizeGreaterThan`) or a maximum size
 (`ObjectSizeLessThan`), or you can specify a range of object sizes in bytes. When using more
 than one filter, such as a prefix and size rule, you must wrap the filters in an `<And>` element.



```
<LifecycleConfiguration>
  <Rule>
    <ID>Transition with a prefix and based on size</ID>
    <Filter>
       <And>
          <Prefix>tax/</Prefix>
          <ObjectSizeGreaterThan>500</ObjectSizeGreaterThan>
       </And>   
    </Filter>
    <Status>Enabled</Status>
    <Transition>
      <Days>365</Days>
      <StorageClass>GLACIER</StorageClass>
    </Transition>
  </Rule>
</LifecycleConfiguration>
```

If you're specifying a range by using both the `ObjectSizeGreaterThan` and
 `ObjectSizeLessThan` elements, the maximum object size must be larger
 than the minimum object size. When using more than one filter, you must wrap the filters
 in an `<And>` element. The following example shows how to specify
 objects in a range between 500 bytes and 64,000 bytes. When you're specifying a range,
 the `ObjectSizeGreaterThan` and `ObjectSizeLessThan` filters
 exclude the specified values. For more information, see [Filter element](intro-lifecycle-rules.md#intro-lifecycle-rules-filter "intro-lifecycle-rules.md#intro-lifecycle-rules-filter").



```
<LifecycleConfiguration>
    <Rule>
        ...
          <And>
             <ObjectSizeGreaterThan>500</ObjectSizeGreaterThan>
             <ObjectSizeLessThan>64000</ObjectSizeLessThan>
          </And>
    </Rule>
</LifecycleConfiguration>
```

You can also create rules to specifically expire noncurrent objects that have no data,
 including noncurrent delete marker objects created in a versioning-enabled bucket. The
 following example uses the `NoncurrentVersionExpiration` action to remove
 noncurrent versions 30 days after they become noncurrent and to retain 10 noncurrent
 versions. This example also uses the `ObjectSizeLessThan` element to filter
 only objects with no data. 


Be aware that more than 10 newer noncurrent versions must exist before Amazon S3 can expire
 a given version. Amazon S3 will permanently delete any additional noncurrent versions beyond
 the specified number to retain. For the deletion to occur, both the
 `NoncurrentDays` and the `NewerNoncurrentVersions` values must
 be exceeded. 



```
<LifecycleConfiguration>
  <Rule>
    <ID>Expire noncurrent with size less than 1 byte</ID>
    <Filter>
       <ObjectSizeLessThan>1</ObjectSizeLessThan>
    </Filter>
    <Status>Enabled</Status>
    <NoncurrentVersionExpiration>     
       <NewerNoncurrentVersions>10</NewerNoncurrentVersions>
       <NoncurrentDays>30</NoncurrentDays>
    </NoncurrentVersionExpiration>
  </Rule>
</LifecycleConfiguration>
```

## Example: Allowing objects smaller than 128 KB to be transitioned


Amazon S3 applies a default behavior to your Lifecycle configuration that prevents objects smaller than 128 KB from being transitioned to any storage class. You can allow smaller objects to transition by adding a minimum size (`ObjectSizeGreaterThan`) or a maximum size
 (`ObjectSizeLessThan`) filter that specifies a smaller size to the configuration. The following example allows any object smaller than 128 KB to transition to the S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval storage class:



```
<LifecycleConfiguration>
  <Rule>
    <ID>Allow small object transitions</ID>
    <Filter>
          <ObjectSizeGreaterThan>1</ObjectSizeGreaterThan>
    </Filter>
    <Status>Enabled</Status>
    <Transition>
      <Days>365</Days>
      <StorageClass>GLACIER_IR</StorageClass>
    </Transition>
  </Rule>
</LifecycleConfiguration>
```

###### Note

In September 2024, Amazon S3 updated the default transition behavior for small objects, as
 follows:


* **Updated default transition behavior** — Starting September 2024, the default behavior prevents objects smaller than 128 KB from being transitioned to any storage class.
* **Previous default transition behavior** — Before September 2024, the default behavior allowed objects smaller than 128 KB to be transitioned only to the S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval and S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage classes.
Configurations created before September 2024 retain the previous transition
 behavior unless you modify them. That is, if you create, edit, or delete rules, the
 default transition behavior for your configuration changes to the updated behavior.
 If your use case requires, you can change the default transition behavior so that
 objects smaller than 128KB will transition to S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval and S3 Glacier Deep Archive. To do
 this, use the optional `x-amz-transition-object-size-minimum-default`
 header in a [PutBucketLifecycleConfiguration](../API/API_PutBucketLifecycleConfiguration.md "../API/API_PutBucketLifecycleConfiguration.md") request.


The following example shows how to use the
 `x-amz-transition-object-size-minimum-default` header in a [PutBucketLifecycleConfiguration](../API/API_PutBucketLifecycleConfiguration.md "../API/API_PutBucketLifecycleConfiguration.md") request to apply the
 `varies_by_storage_class` default transition behavior to an S3 Lifecycle
 configuration. This behavior allows object smaller than 128 KB to transition to the
 S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval or S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage classes. By default, all other storage classes will
 prevent transitions smaller than 128 KB. You can still use custom filters to change the
 minimum transition size for any storage class. Custom filters always take precedence
 over the default transition behavior:



```
HTTP/1.1 200
x-amz-transition-object-size-minimum-default: varies_by_storage_class
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
...
```
