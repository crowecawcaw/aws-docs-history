# Giving users permission to access Amazon Personalize

To provide your users access to Amazon Personalize, you create an IAM policy that grants permission to access your Amazon Personalize resources
and pass your service role to Amazon Personalize.
Then you use that policy when you add permissions to your users, groups or roles.

## Creating a new IAM policy for your users

Create an IAM policy that provides Amazon Personalize full access to your Amazon Personalize resources and `PassRole` permissions to pass your service role to Amazon Personalize (created
in [Creating an IAM role for Amazon Personalize](set-up-required-permissions.md#set-up-create-role-with-permissions "set-up-required-permissions.md#set-up-create-role-with-permissions")).

###### To use the JSON policy editor to create a policy

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the IAM console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/ "https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/").
2. In the navigation pane on the left, choose **Policies**.

If this is your first time choosing **Policies**, the
**Welcome to Managed Policies** page appears. Choose **Get
Started**. 3. At the top of the page, choose **Create policy**. 4. In the **Policy editor** section, choose the
**JSON** option. 5. Enter the following JSON policy document:

```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "personalize:*"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        },
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "iam:PassRole"
            ],
            "Resource": "arn:aws:iam::`123456789012`:role/`ServiceRoleName`",
            "Condition": {
                "StringEquals": {
                    "iam:PassedToService": "personalize.amazonaws.com"
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

6. Choose **Next**.

###### Note

You can switch between the **Visual** and **JSON**
editor options anytime. However, if you make changes or choose **Next**
in the **Visual** editor, IAM might restructure your policy to
optimize it for the visual editor. For more information, see [Policy restructuring](../../../IAM/latest/UserGuide/troubleshoot_policies.md#troubleshoot_viseditor-restructure "../../../IAM/latest/UserGuide/troubleshoot_policies.md#troubleshoot_viseditor-restructure")
in the _IAM User Guide_. 7. On the **Review and create** page, enter a **Policy
name** and a **Description** (optional) for the policy that
you are creating. Review **Permissions defined in this policy** to see
the permissions that are granted by your policy. 8. Choose **Create policy** to save your new policy.

To grant only the permissions required to perform a task in Amazon Personalize, modify the preceding policy to include only the required actions for your user. For a complete list
of Amazon Personalize actions, see [Actions, resources, and condition keys for Amazon Personalize](../../../service-authorization/latest/reference/list_amazonpersonalize.md "../../../service-authorization/latest/reference/list_amazonpersonalize.md").

## Providing access to Amazon Personalize

Attach the new IAM policy when you provide permissions to your users.

To provide access, add permissions to your users, groups, or roles:

- Users and groups in AWS IAM Identity Center:

Create a permission set. Follow the instructions in [Create a permission set](../../../singlesignon/latest/userguide/howtocreatepermissionset.md "../../../singlesignon/latest/userguide/howtocreatepermissionset.md") in the _AWS IAM Identity Center User Guide_.

- Users managed in IAM through an identity provider:

Create a role for identity federation. Follow the instructions in [Create a role for a third-party identity provider (federation)](../../../IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-idp.md "../../../IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-idp.md")
in the _IAM User Guide_.

- IAM users:
  - Create a role that your user can assume. Follow the instructions in [Create a role for an IAM user](../../../IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-user.md "../../../IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-user.md") in the _IAM User Guide_.
  - (Not recommended) Attach a policy directly to a user or add a user to a user group. Follow the instructions in [Adding permissions to a user (console)](../../../IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_users_change-permissions.md#users_change_permissions-add-console "../../../IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_users_change-permissions.md#users_change_permissions-add-console") in the _IAM User Guide_.
