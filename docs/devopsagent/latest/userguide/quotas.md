# Quotas
<a name="quotas"></a>

AWS DevOps Agent quotas include number of agent spaces, concurrent investigations and more. You can request increases for some quotas, but not all quotas can be increased. These increases are not granted immediately, so it may take a couple of hours to days for your increase to become effective. Unless otherwise noted, each quota is Region-specific.
