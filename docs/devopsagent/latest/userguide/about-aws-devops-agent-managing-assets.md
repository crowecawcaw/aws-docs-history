# Managing Assets

AWS DevOps Agent stores the configuration and reference material for an Agent Space as **assets**, the customer-managed resources that shape what the agent knows and how it behaves. Skills, AGENTS.md files, and attachments are all assets, and you can create, read, update, and delete them programmatically through the Asset API.

This topic explains the asset model, the IAM permissions you need, the metadata each asset type expects, and how to manage assets end-to-end with the AWS CLI and AWS SDK for Python (Boto3). For the conceptual overview of skills themselves, see [DevOps Agent Skills](about-aws-devops-agent-devops-agent-skills.md "about-aws-devops-agent-devops-agent-skills.md"). For agent-generated knowledge that you do not create yourself, see [Learned Skills](about-aws-devops-agent-learned-skills.md "about-aws-devops-agent-learned-skills.md").

## When to use the Asset API

The Operator Web App is the fastest way to author a single skill or upload an AGENTS.md file interactively. The Asset API exposes the same operations programmatically so that scripts and automation can manage assets without going through the Web App. Common reasons to call the Asset API directly include:

- Authoring or updating an asset from a script, terminal, or notebook instead of the Web App.
- Bulk-loading a starter set of skills or AGENTS.md files into a new Agent Space.
- Reading an asset's contents to back it up or compare versions.

Every operation in the Asset API is exposed through the AWS CLI as `aws devops-agent <operation>` and through the AWS SDKs as the `devops-agent` client.

## Asset API operations

The Asset API exposes the following operations. Each row lists the IAM action you must grant to call the operation and the resource the action applies to. Every action lives in the `aidevops:` namespace and, except for `ListAssetTypes`, applies to an Agent Space resource of the form `arn:aws:aidevops:<region>:<account-id>:agentspace/<agentSpaceId>`. For broader background on `aidevops:` permissions, see [DevOps Agent IAM permissions](aws-devops-agent-security-devops-agent-iam-permissions.md "aws-devops-agent-security-devops-agent-iam-permissions.md").

| Operation           | Description                                                                                                   | IAM action                   | Resource    |

### Example IAM policies

The following policy grants full management access to assets in a single Agent Space:

```
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "aidevops:CreateAsset",
        "aidevops:GetAsset",
        "aidevops:UpdateAsset",
        "aidevops:DeleteAsset",
        "aidevops:ListAssets",
        "aidevops:ListAssetVersions",
        "aidevops:GetAssetContent",
        "aidevops:CreateAssetFile",
        "aidevops:GetAssetFile",
        "aidevops:UpdateAssetFile",
        "aidevops:DeleteAssetFile",
        "aidevops:ListAssetFiles"
      ],
      "Resource": "arn:aws:aidevops:us-east-1:111122223333:agentspace/8f6187a7-0388-4926-8217-3a0fe32f757c"
    },
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "aidevops:ListAssetTypes",
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
```

The following policy grants read-only access to assets in a single Agent Space:

```
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "aidevops:GetAsset",
        "aidevops:ListAssets",
        "aidevops:ListAssetVersions",
        "aidevops:GetAssetContent",
        "aidevops:GetAssetFile",
        "aidevops:ListAssetFiles"
      ],
      "Resource": "arn:aws:aidevops:us-east-1:111122223333:agentspace/8f6187a7-0388-4926-8217-3a0fe32f757c"
    },
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "aidevops:ListAssetTypes",
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Asset types

Every asset has an `assetType` string that identifies what kind of resource it is. Six asset types can be created through the Asset API: `skill`, `agents_md`, `attachment`, `custom_agent`, `test_profile`, and `feedback`. The sections that follow describe each type. You can also call `ListAssetTypes` to retrieve the type identifiers at runtime.

Each asset carries a free-form `metadata` JSON object that describes the resource. The keys inside `metadata` use snake_case (for example, `agent_types`, `skill_type`). The keys outside `metadata`, at the top level of the request body, use camelCase (for example, `agentSpaceId`, `assetType`, `clientToken`). The required and optional `metadata` keys depend on the asset type, as described in the sections that follow.

When you call `UpdateAsset` or `UpdateAssetFile`, the service applies PATCH semantics to `metadata`: keys that you include are replaced, and keys that you omit retain their stored values. You cannot change an asset's `assetType` after it has been created.

### skill

A `skill` asset packages instructions and reference material that the agent loads when relevant. A simple skill is a single `SKILL.md` file; a complex skill is a zip bundle that contains a `SKILL.md` file plus optional `references/` or `assets/` directories.

**Required `metadata` properties:**

- **name** (string) – A unique identifier for the skill. Lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens only, 1–64 characters. Must not start or end with a hyphen. Required for simple skills only. For zip uploads the service reads `name` from the `SKILL.md` frontmatter and any value supplied here is ignored.
- **description** (string) – A 1–1024 character explanation of when the agent should use the skill. Required for simple skills only. For zip uploads the service reads `description` from the `SKILL.md` frontmatter and any value supplied here is ignored.
- **agent_types** (array of strings) – One or more agent types this skill applies to. Use `["GENERIC"]` to make the skill available to all agent types. Other values include `CHAT`, `INCIDENT_TRIAGE`, `INCIDENT_RCA`, `INCIDENT_MITIGATION`, `PREVENTION`, `CHANGE_REVIEW`, `CHANGE_RELEASE`, `QUALITY_ASSURANCE_TESTING`, `RELEASE_SHEPHERD`, `RELEASE_READINESS_REVIEW`, and `RELEASE_TESTING`. The `GENERIC` value cannot be combined with other values.

**Optional `metadata` properties:**

- **skill_type** (string) – Defaults to `USER`. The Asset API only allows customer-created skills, so the only accepted value is `USER`. The service rejects requests that set `skill_type` to `LEARNED`, which is reserved for skills generated by the agent itself.
- **status** (string) – Activation state of the skill. Accepted values are `ACTIVE` and `INACTIVE` (uppercase only). Defaults to `ACTIVE`. Inactive skills remain in the Agent Space but are not loaded by the agent during investigations or chat. Use `UpdateAsset` with `metadata.status` to deactivate or reactivate a skill without deleting it. Skills are the only asset type that supports activation; the `status` field is ignored on every other asset type. See [Activating and deactivating skills](#activating-and-deactivating-skills "#activating-and-deactivating-skills") for a worked example.
- **enable_tools** (array of strings) – A list of tool identifiers that the agent can call when it loads this skill.

**Example `metadata`:**

```
{
  "name": "rds-performance-investigation",
  "description": "Investigation procedures for RDS performance issues including connection exhaustion, slow queries, replication lag, and storage capacity. Use this skill when investigating database latency, connection errors, or read/write performance degradation.",
  "agent_types": ["GENERIC"]
}
```

**Limits:** Zip uploads must not exceed 6 MB. An Agent Space can contain up to 200 user-created skills.

### agents_md

An `agents_md` asset is a markdown file containing standing agent instructions for a specific agent type. The agent loads the matching AGENTS.md at the start of every task. For more information about agent instructions, see [Agent instructions](about-aws-devops-agent-agent-instructions.md "about-aws-devops-agent-agent-instructions.md").

**Required `metadata` properties:**

- **agent_type** (string) – The agent type the AGENTS.md file applies to. Valid values are `GENERIC`, `CHAT`, `INCIDENT_TRIAGE`, `INCIDENT_RCA`, `INCIDENT_MITIGATION`, `PREVENTION`, `CHANGE_REVIEW`, `CHANGE_RELEASE`, `QUALITY_ASSURANCE_TESTING`, `RELEASE_SHEPHERD`, `RELEASE_READINESS_REVIEW`, and `RELEASE_TESTING`.

**Example `metadata`:**

```
{
  "agent_type": "INCIDENT_TRIAGE"
}
```

**Limits:** Each Agent Space can contain at most one AGENTS.md per `agent_type`. The file content must be markdown (`text/markdown`) and must not exceed 25 KB.

### attachment

An `attachment` asset stores a binary or text file that the agent can reference during investigations, for example, an architecture diagram, a runbook PDF, or a sample log file.

**Required `metadata` properties:**

- **filename** (string) – The original file name, including the base name and any extension (for example, `topology.png`).
- **extension** (string) – The file extension without the leading dot (for example, `png`, `pdf`, `csv`).
- **size** (number) – The size of the file in bytes.

**Example `metadata`:**

```
{
  "filename": "topology.png",
  "extension": "png",
  "size": 184320
}
```

**Limits:** The total size of all attachments in an Agent Space cannot exceed 10 GB.

### custom_agent

A `custom_agent` asset defines a specialized agent configuration with a curated set of tools and skills. Use a custom agent to scope the agent to a specific workflow or set of capabilities.

**Required `metadata` properties:**

- **name** (string) – A unique identifier for the custom agent. Lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens only, 1–64 characters. Must not start or end with a hyphen.

**Optional `metadata` properties:**

- **tools** (array of strings) – The tool identifiers the custom agent is allowed to use. Defaults to an empty list when omitted.
- **skills** (array of strings) – The skill identifiers the custom agent loads. Defaults to an empty list when omitted.

**Example `metadata`:**

```
{
  "name": "rds-firefighter",
  "tools": ["cloudwatch:GetMetricData", "rds:DescribeDBInstances"],
  "skills": ["rds-performance-investigation"]
}
```

### test_profile

A `test_profile` asset stores a reusable configuration for a release-testing run, including the kind of testing to perform and the target endpoint.

**Required `metadata` properties:**

- **test_agent_type** (string) – The type of testing this profile performs. Valid values are `releaseUiTesting` and `releaseApiTesting`.
- **target_url** (string) – The URL the test run targets.

**Optional `metadata` properties:**

- **name** (string) – A human-readable identifier for the test profile. Lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens only, 1–128 characters. Must not start or end with a hyphen.
- **description** (string) – A 1–1024 character description of what the test profile covers.
- **test_personas** (array of strings) – The personas to exercise during the test run. Valid values are `guest` and `authenticated`.
- **api_spec** (string) – An API specification for the test run. Relevant for `releaseApiTesting`.
- **credentials_secret_arn** (string) – The ARN of an AWS Secrets Manager secret holding credentials for the test run.

**Example `metadata`:**

```
{
  "name": "checkout-api-tests",
  "description": "Release API tests for the checkout service.",
  "test_agent_type": "releaseApiTesting",
  "target_url": "https://api.example.com",
  "test_personas": ["guest", "authenticated"],
  "api_spec": "openapi: 3.0.0",
  "credentials_secret_arn": "arn:aws:secretsmanager:us-east-1:111122223333:secret:checkout-creds"
}
```

### feedback

A `feedback` asset records customer-provided feedback on a single agent execution. Use feedback assets to capture verdicts and notes that downstream evaluation pipelines can aggregate.

**Required `metadata` properties:**

- **agent_types** (array of strings) – The agent types that produced the execution. Must contain at least one value (for example, `INCIDENT_TRIAGE`).

**Optional `metadata` properties:**

- **execution_id** (string) – The execution this feedback is associated with. Set this on `CreateAsset`; it cannot be changed by `UpdateAsset`.

**Example `metadata`:**

```
{
  "execution_id": "b2c3d4e5-6789-01ab-cdef-example22222",
  "agent_types": ["INCIDENT_TRIAGE"]
}
```

## Asset content: file or zip

Every `CreateAsset` request includes a `content` object that holds the bytes the asset stores. The shape of `content` depends on whether you are uploading a single file or a zip bundle:

- **Single text file** – `content.file.body.text` carries up to 1.5 MB of UTF-8 text. Use this for simple skills and AGENTS.md files.

`json { "content": { "file": { "path": "SKILL.md", "body": { "text": "# Skill\n\nInstructions go here." } } } }`

- **Single binary file** – `content.file.body.bytes` carries up to 6 MB of base64-encoded binary content. Use this for attachments such as images or PDFs. Because the blob is nested inside the `content` union, base64-encode the file ahead of time and submit the request with `--cli-input-json` (see [Create a skill from a binary file](#create-a-skill-from-a-binary-file "#create-a-skill-from-a-binary-file") for a worked example).

`json { "content": { "file": { "path": "topology.png", "body": { "bytes": "<base64-encoded bytes>" } } } }`

- **Zip bundle** – `content.zip.zipFile` carries a base64-encoded zip archive of up to 6 MB. Use this for skills that include a `SKILL.md` plus additional files in a `references/` or `assets/` directory.

`json { "content": { "zip": { "zipFile": "<base64-encoded zip bytes>" } } }`

To add, replace, or delete individual files inside an existing asset without re-uploading the whole bundle, use `CreateAssetFile`, `UpdateAssetFile`, and `DeleteAssetFile`.

## Managing a skill end-to-end

The walkthrough that follows creates a skill three different ways (from a single text file, from a binary file, and from a zip bundle), and then exercises the read, update, and delete operations. Replace `8f6187a7-0388-4926-8217-3a0fe32f757c` with your Agent Space ID.

### Create a skill from a single text file

This is the simplest path: a single `SKILL.md` file uploaded inline. Because the upload contains exactly one text file, you must supply `name` and `description` in `metadata`.

**AWS CLI:**

```
aws devops-agent create-asset \
  --agent-space-id 8f6187a7-0388-4926-8217-3a0fe32f757c \
  --asset-type skill \
  --metadata '{
    "name": "rds-performance-investigation",
    "description": "Investigation procedures for RDS performance issues. Use when investigating database latency, connection errors, or query timeouts.",
    "agent_types": ["GENERIC"]
  }' \
  --content '{
    "file": {
      "path": "SKILL.md",
      "body": {
        "text": "# RDS Performance Investigation\n\nUse this skill when customers report database latency, connection errors, query timeouts, or read/write performance degradation."
      }
    }
  }'
```

**Python (Boto3):**

```
import boto3

client = boto3.client("devops-agent")

response = client.create_asset(
    agentSpaceId="8f6187a7-0388-4926-8217-3a0fe32f757c",
    assetType="skill",
    metadata={
        "name": "rds-performance-investigation",
        "description": (
            "Investigation procedures for RDS performance issues. "
            "Use when investigating database latency, connection errors, "
            "or query timeouts."
        ),
        "agent_types": ["GENERIC"],
    },
    content={
        "file": {
            "path": "SKILL.md",
            "body": {
                "text": (
                    "# RDS Performance Investigation\n\n"
                    "Use this skill when customers report database latency, "
                    "connection errors, query timeouts, or read/write "
                    "performance degradation."
                )
            },
        }
    },
)

asset_id = response["asset"]["assetId"]
```

### Create a skill from a binary file

Use a binary upload when the skill content is not UTF-8 text. The example below uploads a pre-rendered PDF as the skill body. Because the request body contains a base64-encoded blob nested inside the `content` union, supply the request from a JSON file with `--cli-input-json` and base64-encode the blob ahead of time.

The `-w 0` flag below tells GNU `base64` to emit the encoded blob on a single line; without it the default 76-character line wrap inserts newlines that produce invalid JSON when the blob is interpolated into the heredoc. On macOS, use `base64 -i ops-runbook.pdf` (the BSD `base64` does not wrap by default).

**Build the request body:**

```
base64 -w 0 ops-runbook.pdf > ops-runbook.b64
cat > create-skill.json <<EOF
{
  "agentSpaceId": "8f6187a7-0388-4926-8217-3a0fe32f757c",
  "assetType": "skill",
  "metadata": {
    "name": "ops-runbook",
    "description": "Operations runbook covering on-call escalation paths.",
    "agent_types": ["GENERIC"]
  },
  "content": {
    "file": {
      "path": "SKILL.pdf",
      "body": { "bytes": "$(cat ops-runbook.b64)" }
    }
  }
}
EOF
```

**AWS CLI:**

```
aws devops-agent create-asset --cli-input-json file://create-skill.json
```

**Python (Boto3):**

```
with open("ops-runbook.pdf", "rb") as f:
    body_bytes = f.read()

response = client.create_asset(
    agentSpaceId="8f6187a7-0388-4926-8217-3a0fe32f757c",
    assetType="skill",
    metadata={
        "name": "ops-runbook",
        "description": "Operations runbook covering on-call escalation paths.",
        "agent_types": ["GENERIC"],
    },
    content={
        "file": {
            "path": "SKILL.pdf",
            "body": {"bytes": body_bytes},
        }
    },
)
```

### Create a skill from a zip bundle

Use a zip upload when the skill includes more than one file, for example, a `SKILL.md` plus reference material and assets. For zip uploads the service reads `name` and `description` from the `SKILL.md` frontmatter, so do not include them in `metadata`.

The zip layout looks like:

```
rds-performance-investigation.zip
├── SKILL.md
├── references/
│   └── rds-metrics-reference.md
└── assets/
    └── rds-investigation-flowchart.png
```

`SKILL.md` must include frontmatter so the service can extract the name and description:

```
---
name: rds-performance-investigation
description: Investigation procedures for RDS performance issues including
  connection exhaustion, slow queries, replication lag, and storage capacity.
  Use this skill when investigating database latency, connection errors, or
  read/write performance degradation.
---

# RDS Performance Investigation
...
```

**Build the request body:**

```
base64 -w 0 rds-performance-investigation.zip > skill.zip.b64
cat > create-skill.json <<EOF
{
  "agentSpaceId": "8f6187a7-0388-4926-8217-3a0fe32f757c",
  "assetType": "skill",
  "metadata": { "agent_types": ["GENERIC"] },
  "content": {
    "zip": { "zipFile": "$(cat skill.zip.b64)" }
  }
}
EOF
```

**AWS CLI:**

```
aws devops-agent create-asset --cli-input-json file://create-skill.json
```

**Python (Boto3):**

```
with open("rds-performance-investigation.zip", "rb") as f:
    zip_bytes = f.read()

response = client.create_asset(
    agentSpaceId="8f6187a7-0388-4926-8217-3a0fe32f757c",
    assetType="skill",
    metadata={"agent_types": ["GENERIC"]},
    content={"zip": {"zipFile": zip_bytes}},
)
```

### Get, list, update, and delete

Use `GetAsset` to retrieve a single asset by ID:

```
aws devops-agent get-asset \
  --agent-space-id 8f6187a7-0388-4926-8217-3a0fe32f757c \
  --asset-id <assetId>
```

Use `ListAssets` to page through every asset in an Agent Space:

```
aws devops-agent list-assets \
  --agent-space-id 8f6187a7-0388-4926-8217-3a0fe32f757c \
  --max-results 50

aws devops-agent list-assets \
  --agent-space-id 8f6187a7-0388-4926-8217-3a0fe32f757c \
  --max-results 50 \
  --next-token <token>
```

Use `UpdateAsset` to change one or more `metadata` fields without re-uploading content. Keys that you omit keep their existing values:

```
aws devops-agent update-asset \
  --agent-space-id 8f6187a7-0388-4926-8217-3a0fe32f757c \
  --asset-id <assetId> \
  --metadata '{ "agent_types": ["INCIDENT_TRIAGE", "INCIDENT_RCA"] }'
```

Use `ListAssetVersions` to inspect the version history of an asset. Each successful `UpdateAsset` or `UpdateAssetFile` call advances the asset's version number:

```
aws devops-agent list-asset-versions \
  --agent-space-id 8f6187a7-0388-4926-8217-3a0fe32f757c \
  --asset-id <assetId>
```

Use `DeleteAsset` to remove the asset and all of its files:

```
aws devops-agent delete-asset \
  --agent-space-id 8f6187a7-0388-4926-8217-3a0fe32f757c \
  --asset-id <assetId>
```

### Add a single file to an existing skill

If you already created a skill from a zip bundle and want to add one new reference file, you do not need to re-upload the whole bundle. Use `CreateAssetFile`:

```
aws devops-agent create-asset-file \
  --agent-space-id 8f6187a7-0388-4926-8217-3a0fe32f757c \
  --asset-id <assetId> \
  --path references/troubleshooting.md \
  --content '{ "text": "# Troubleshooting\n\nAdditional notes." }'
```

To replace the file in place, use `update-asset-file` with the same arguments. To remove it, use `delete-asset-file`.

### Activating and deactivating skills

Skills carry an activation state in `metadata.status`. New skills are `ACTIVE` by default and are loaded by the agent during investigations and chat. You can deactivate a skill to take it out of rotation without deleting it, for example while you investigate why it is producing unexpected results, and reactivate it later.

**Set the initial state on create** by including `metadata.status` in the `CreateAsset` request:

```
aws devops-agent create-asset \
  --agent-space-id 8f6187a7-0388-4926-8217-3a0fe32f757c \
  --asset-type skill \
  --metadata '{
    "name": "rds-performance-investigation",
    "description": "Investigation procedures for RDS performance issues.",
    "agent_types": ["GENERIC"],
    "status": "INACTIVE"
  }' \
  --content '{
    "file": {
      "path": "SKILL.md",
      "body": { "text": "# RDS Performance Investigation" }
    }
  }'
```

**Deactivate an existing skill** with `UpdateAsset`. Because `metadata` is applied as a partial update, sending only `status` leaves every other field intact:

```
aws devops-agent update-asset \
  --agent-space-id 8f6187a7-0388-4926-8217-3a0fe32f757c \
  --asset-id <assetId> \
  --metadata '{ "status": "INACTIVE" }'
```

**Reactivate** the same way, with `"status": "ACTIVE"`:

```
aws devops-agent update-asset \
  --agent-space-id 8f6187a7-0388-4926-8217-3a0fe32f757c \
  --asset-id <assetId> \
  --metadata '{ "status": "ACTIVE" }'
```

`GetAsset` and `ListAssets` always include the current `status` in `metadata` for skill assets, so you can read the live activation state at any time.

The `status` field is case-sensitive. Only `ACTIVE` and `INACTIVE` (uppercase) are accepted. Any other value fails with a `ValidationException`. Activation applies only to skills; setting `metadata.status` on any other asset type has no effect and the field is dropped from the response.

## Examples for the other asset types

The skill walkthrough above applies to every other asset type. The only difference is the `metadata` block and, for attachments, the choice of binary content. The minimal `CreateAsset` calls below illustrate each type.

**Create an AGENTS.md:**

```
aws devops-agent create-asset \
  --agent-space-id 8f6187a7-0388-4926-8217-3a0fe32f757c \
  --asset-type agents_md \
  --metadata '{ "agent_type": "INCIDENT_TRIAGE" }' \
  --content '{
    "file": {
      "path": "AGENTS.md",
      "body": { "text": "# Triage Instructions\n\nFollow these steps for new incidents." }
    }
  }'
```

**Create an attachment** (binary content; build the request from a JSON file as shown in [Create a skill from a binary file](#create-a-skill-from-a-binary-file "#create-a-skill-from-a-binary-file")):

```
base64 -w 0 topology.png > topology.png.b64
cat > create-attachment.json <<EOF
{
  "agentSpaceId": "8f6187a7-0388-4926-8217-3a0fe32f757c",
  "assetType": "attachment",
  "metadata": {
    "filename": "topology.png",
    "extension": "png",
    "size": 184320
  },
  "content": {
    "file": {
      "path": "topology.png",
      "body": { "bytes": "$(cat topology.png.b64)" }
    }
  }
}
EOF
aws devops-agent create-asset --cli-input-json file://create-attachment.json
```

**Create a custom agent:**

```
aws devops-agent create-asset \
  --agent-space-id 8f6187a7-0388-4926-8217-3a0fe32f757c \
  --asset-type custom_agent \
  --metadata '{
    "name": "rds-firefighter",
    "tools": ["cloudwatch:GetMetricData", "rds:DescribeDBInstances"],
    "skills": ["rds-performance-investigation"]
  }' \
  --content '{
    "file": {
      "path": "AGENT.md",
      "body": { "text": "# RDS Firefighter\n\nCustom agent for RDS incidents." }
    }
  }'
```

**Create a test profile:**

```
aws devops-agent create-asset \
  --agent-space-id 8f6187a7-0388-4926-8217-3a0fe32f757c \
  --asset-type test_profile \
  --metadata '{
    "name": "checkout-api-tests",
    "test_agent_type": "releaseApiTesting",
    "target_url": "https://api.example.com",
    "test_personas": ["guest", "authenticated"]
  }' \
  --content '{
    "file": {
      "path": "PROFILE.md",
      "body": { "text": "# Checkout API test profile" }
    }
  }'
```

**Create a feedback asset:**

```
aws devops-agent create-asset \
  --agent-space-id 8f6187a7-0388-4926-8217-3a0fe32f757c \
  --asset-type feedback \
  --metadata '{
    "execution_id": "b2c3d4e5-6789-01ab-cdef-example22222",
    "agent_types": ["INCIDENT_TRIAGE"]
  }' \
  --content '{
    "file": {
      "path": "FEEDBACK.md",
      "body": { "text": "{\"verdict\":\"correct\"}" }
    }
  }'
```

**List supported asset types:**

```
aws devops-agent list-asset-types
```
