# Agent instructions

Use agent instructions to provide always-on guidance that AWS DevOps Agent applies to every session. A session is a single conversation or investigation with an agent. On the **Knowledge** page in your Agent Space Operator Web App, choose the **Instructions** tab to set instructions that apply to all agents, or set instructions for a specific managed agent such as Chat or Incident triage. These instructions are stored as an AGENTS.md file. Unlike [DevOps Agent Skills](about-aws-devops-agent-devops-agent-skills.md "about-aws-devops-agent-devops-agent-skills.md"), which load on demand when the agent matches a skill description to the current task, agent instructions are always present from the start of every session, regardless of what the agent is working on.

## What are agent instructions

Agent instructions provide unconditional, always-on guidance for your agents. At the start of every session, the agent service retrieves the instructions configured for your Agent Space and injects their content directly into the agent system prompt. The agent does not decide whether to load them; they are always present.

Each agent session receives instructions from both the global instructions and the relevant agent-specific instructions, for example, Chat.

Agent instructions are stored as AGENTS.md files and differ from [DevOps Agent Skills](about-aws-devops-agent-devops-agent-skills.md "about-aws-devops-agent-devops-agent-skills.md") in several important ways:

| Aspect               | Skill                                                    | Agent instructions (AGENTS.md)                                     |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Name and description | Required                                                 | Not applicable                                                     |
| Content format       | Markdown or ZIP bundle                                   | Markdown only                                                      |
| Resource files       | Supported                                                | Not supported                                                      |
| Context injection    | On demand (agent decides via skill description matching) | Always (unconditional, every session)                              |
| Uniqueness           | Multiple per Agent Space                                 | One per agent (one for global instructions, one per managed agent) |

Agent instructions have no name or description field. The underlying AGENTS.md file contains only markdown with no frontmatter, no ZIP bundle support, and no resource files.

## Why use agent instructions

Agent instructions give you a reliable way to ensure certain guidance is always in context, without depending on the agent's skill-loading decisions.

**Key benefits:**

- **Predictability:** Instructions are always present, regardless of what task the agent is working on. No description matching is required, and the agent cannot skip the content.
- **Guaranteed coverage:** Unlike Skills, which the agent may or may not load depending on task relevance, agent instructions are always injected at the start of every session.
- **Standing policies:** Use agent instructions for standing operational policies, security guidelines, coding standards, or any guidance that must apply to every session without exception.
- **Targeted scope:** You can apply instructions to all agent types at once using global instructions, or restrict instructions to a specific agent type when the guidance is relevant only to that agent's work.

## How agent instructions work

When a session starts, the agent service retrieves the instructions configured for your Agent Space and injects their content into the agent system prompt before the session begins. This happens automatically for every session. The agent does not evaluate whether to load them; it always injects the content.

Each new session loads the instructions fresh at startup. If you update your instructions, the change takes effect immediately for sessions that start after you save. Sessions that are already in progress continue using the content that was loaded when they started.

Scoping determines which instructions a session receives. Global instructions apply to all agent types in your Agent Space, so every session receives them. Agent-specific instructions apply only to sessions of that particular agent type. A session receives instructions from both the global instructions and the relevant agent-specific instructions.

## Agent type scoping

Scoping controls which agent sessions receive a given set of instructions. There are two scoping options:

- **Global instructions:** Applies to all agent types in your Agent Space. Every agent session receives this content.
- **Agent-specific:** Applies only to sessions of the selected agent type.

The managed agents available for agent-specific instructions are:

- **Chat** - Ad-hoc questions and requests during chat sessions.
- **Incident triage** - Alarm filtering, severity classification, and initial scoping.
- **Incident RCA** - Root cause analysis with evidence collection and validation.
- **Incident mitigation** - Short-term remediation and long-term fix recommendations.
- **Incident UI** – Generation of an investigation's outputs, including those posted to other platforms.
- **Evaluation** - Agent performance scoring and policy compliance checks.
- **Release testing** – Automated UI and API testing against deployed web applications and REST APIs.

## Content size guidance

Every time you start a conversation or investigation, the agent reads your entire instructions before doing anything else. The agent has a fixed amount of working memory per session, and your instructions use some of it. The larger the file, the less room remains for your questions, investigations, the logs the agent reads, and its own reasoning. Shorter, focused instructions give the agent more capacity to solve your problem.

- **Hard limit:** 25 KB
- **Recommended size:** 120 lines (recommended for most configurations)

Focus your instructions on guidance that must be present in every session. For specialized investigation procedures that apply only to specific tasks, consider using [DevOps Agent Skills](about-aws-devops-agent-devops-agent-skills.md "about-aws-devops-agent-devops-agent-skills.md") instead.

## Example

The following example shows well-formed agent instructions with investigation guidance, response formatting standards, and security requirements that apply to every agent session.

```
# Agent Instructions

## Investigation approach
- Always check CloudWatch alarms and recent deployments before proposing a root cause.

## Response format
- Lead with a one-sentence summary of findings before listing details.
- Include the AWS region and resource identifier for any resource you reference.
- Use bullet points for lists of findings or recommendations.

## Security
- Never log, display, or suggest storing credentials or secrets in plaintext.
- When recommending IAM changes, follow least-privilege principles.
```

## Setting agent instructions

Before setting agent instructions, you must have an Agent Space. For more information, see [Creating an Agent Space](getting-started-with-aws-devops-agent-creating-an-agent-space.md "getting-started-with-aws-devops-agent-creating-an-agent-space.md").

Each agent has exactly one set of instructions. When you save new content, it overwrites the existing content for that agent.

**To set global instructions (applies to all agents):**

1. Navigate to the **Knowledge** page in your Agent Space Operator Web App.
2. Choose the **Instructions** tab.
3. Choose **View** next to **All agents**.
4. Enter your markdown instructions in the editor.
5. Choose **Save**.

**To set instructions for a specific agent:**

1. Navigate to the **Knowledge** page in your Agent Space Operator Web App.
2. Choose the **Instructions** tab.
3. Choose **View** next to the agent you want to configure: **Chat**, **Incident triage**, **Incident RCA**, **Incident mitigation**, **Incident UI**, **Evaluation**, or **Release testing**.
4. Enter your markdown instructions in the editor.
5. Choose **Save**.

## Managing agent instructions

AWS DevOps Agent provides management capabilities for agent instructions through the Operator Web App.

**Viewing instructions:** Navigate to the **Knowledge** page, choose the **Instructions** tab, and choose **View** next to **All agents** or the specific managed agent. The editor shows the current content. Use the **Preview** tab to see the rendered markdown or the **Code** tab to see the raw markdown.

**Editing instructions:** Open the agent as described above, modify the content in the editor, and choose **Save**.

**Uploading instructions from a file:** Open the agent, then choose the **Upload** button in the editor to upload a markdown file from your computer.

**Downloading instructions:** Open the agent, then choose the **Download** button in the editor to download the current content as a file.

**Deleting instructions:** Open the agent, choose the **Delete** button in the editor, and confirm the deletion. This action cannot be undone. Consider downloading the content first if you may need it again.
