After careful consideration, we decided to end support for Amazon FinSpace, effective October 7, 2026. Amazon FinSpace will no longer accept new customers beginning October 7, 2025. As an existing customer with an Amazon FinSpace environment created before October 7, 2025, you can continue to use the service as normal. After October 7, 2026, you will no longer be able to use Amazon FinSpace. For more information, see

# Security best practices in Amazon FinSpace

Amazon FinSpace provides a number of security features to consider as you develop and implement
your own security policies. The following best practices are general guidelines and don't
represent a complete security solution. Because these best practices might not be
appropriate or sufficient for your environment, treat them as helpful considerations rather
than prescriptions.

- Implement least privilege access.
- Limit access to sensitive and important auditing functions.
- When creating resources through the update or bulk import APIs, do not use PHI or
  PII, including the names of datastores and jobs, in any visible fields.
