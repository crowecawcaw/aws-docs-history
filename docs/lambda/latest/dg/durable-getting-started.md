# Creating Lambda durable functions

To get started with Lambda durable functions, use the Lambda console to create a durable function. In a few minutes, you can create and deploy a
durable function that uses steps and waits to demonstrate checkpoint-based execution.

As you carry out the tutorial, you'll learn fundamental durable function concepts, like how to use the `DurableContext` object,
create checkpoints with steps, and pause execution with waits. You'll also learn how replay works when your function resumes after a wait.

To keep things simple, this tutorial shows you how to create your function using either the Python or Node.js runtime. With these interpreted languages, you can edit
function code directly in the console's built-in code editor.

###### Note

Durable functions currently support Python, Node.js (JavaScript/TypeScript), and Java runtimes, as well as container images (OCI). For a complete list of supported runtime versions and container image options, see [Supported runtimes for durable functions](durable-supported-runtimes.md "durable-supported-runtimes.md"). For more information about using container images with Lambda, see [Creating Lambda container images](images-create.md "images-create.md") in the Lambda Developer Guide.

## Create a Lambda durable function with the console

In this example, your durable function processes an order through multiple steps with automatic checkpointing. The function takes a JSON object
containing an order ID, validates the order, processes payment, and confirms the order. Each step is automatically checkpointed, so if the function
is interrupted, it resumes from the last completed step.

Your function also demonstrates a wait operation, pausing execution for a short period to simulate waiting for external confirmation.

###### To create a durable function with the console

1. Open the [Functions page](https://console.aws.amazon.com/lambda/home#/functions "https://console.aws.amazon.com/lambda/home#/functions") of the Lambda console.
2. Choose **Create function**.
3. Select **Author from scratch**.
4. In the **Basic information** pane, for **Function name**, enter
   `myDurableFunction`.
5. For **Runtime**, choose either **Node.js 24** or **Python 3.14**.
6. Select **Enable durable execution**.

Lambda creates your durable function with an [execution role](lambda-intro-execution-role.md "lambda-intro-execution-role.md") that includes permissions for
checkpoint operations (`lambda:CheckpointDurableExecution` and `lambda:GetDurableExecutionState`).

###### Note

Lambda runtimes include the Durable Execution SDK, so you can test durable functions without packaging dependencies. However, we recommend including the SDK in your deployment package for production. This ensures version consistency and avoids potential runtime updates that might affect your function.

Use the console's built-in code editor to add your durable function code.

Node.js

###### To modify the code in the console

1. Choose the **Code** tab.

In the console's built-in code editor, you should see the function code that Lambda
created. If you don't see the **index.mjs** tab in the code editor, select **index.mjs** in the
file explorer as shown on the following diagram.

![Diagram showing the console code editor and the index.mjs file in the file explorer](images/durable-nodejs.png) 2. Paste the following code into the **index.mjs** tab, replacing the code that Lambda created.

```
import {
  withDurableExecution,
} from "@aws/durable-execution-sdk-js";

export const handler = withDurableExecution(
  async (event, context) => {
    const orderId = event.orderId;

    // Step 1: Validate order
    const validationResult = await context.step(async (stepContext) => {
      stepContext.logger.info(`Validating order ${orderId}`);
      return { orderId, status: "validated" };
    });

    // Step 2: Process payment
    const paymentResult = await context.step(async (stepContext) => {
      stepContext.logger.info(`Processing payment for order ${orderId}`);
      return { orderId, status: "paid", amount: 99.99 };
    });

    // Wait for 10 seconds to simulate external confirmation
    await context.wait({ seconds: 10 });

    // Step 3: Confirm order
    const confirmationResult = await context.step(async (stepContext) => {
      stepContext.logger.info(`Confirming order ${orderId}`);
      return { orderId, status: "confirmed" };
    });

    return {
      orderId: orderId,
      status: "completed",
      steps: [validationResult, paymentResult, confirmationResult]
    };
  }
);
```

3. In the **DEPLOY** section, choose **Deploy** to update your function's code:

###### Understanding your durable function code

Before you move to the next step, let's look at the function code and understand key durable function concepts.

- The `withDurableExecution` wrapper:

Your durable function is wrapped with `withDurableExecution`. This wrapper enables durable execution by providing
the `DurableContext` object and managing checkpoint operations.

- The `DurableContext` object:

Instead of the standard Lambda context, your function receives a `DurableContext`. This object provides methods for
durable operations like `step()` and `wait()` that create checkpoints.

- Steps and checkpoints:

Each `context.step()` call creates a checkpoint before and after execution. If your function is interrupted, it resumes
from the last completed checkpoint. The function doesn't re-execute completed steps. It uses their stored results instead.

- Wait operations:

The `context.wait()` call pauses execution without consuming compute resources. When the wait completes, Lambda invokes
your function again and replays the checkpoint log, substituting stored values for completed steps.

- Replay mechanism:

When your function resumes after a wait or interruption, Lambda runs your code from the beginning. However, completed steps don't
re-execute. Lambda replays their results from the checkpoint log. This is why your code must be deterministic.

Python

###### To modify the code in the console

1. Choose the **Code** tab.

In the console's built-in code editor, you should see the function code that Lambda
created. If you don't see the **lambda\_function.py** tab in the code editor, select **lambda\_function.py**
in the file explorer as shown on the following diagram.

![Diagram showing the console code editor and the lambda_function.py file in the file explorer](images/durable-python.png) 2. Paste the following code into the **lambda\_function.py** tab, replacing the code that Lambda created.

```
from aws_durable_execution_sdk_python import (
    DurableContext,
    durable_execution,
    durable_step,
)
from aws_durable_execution_sdk_python.config import Duration

@durable_step
def validate_order(step_context, order_id):
    step_context.logger.info(f"Validating order {order_id}")
    return {"orderId": order_id, "status": "validated"}

@durable_step
def process_payment(step_context, order_id):
    step_context.logger.info(f"Processing payment for order {order_id}")
    return {"orderId": order_id, "status": "paid", "amount": 99.99}

@durable_step
def confirm_order(step_context, order_id):
    step_context.logger.info(f"Confirming order {order_id}")
    return {"orderId": order_id, "status": "confirmed"}

@durable_execution
def lambda_handler(event, context: DurableContext):
    order_id = event['orderId']

    # Step 1: Validate order
    validation_result = context.step(validate_order(order_id))

    # Step 2: Process payment
    payment_result = context.step(process_payment(order_id))

    # Wait for 10 seconds to simulate external confirmation
    context.wait(Duration.from_seconds(10))

    # Step 3: Confirm order
    confirmation_result = context.step(confirm_order(order_id))

    return {
        "orderId": order_id,
        "status": "completed",
        "steps": [validation_result, payment_result, confirmation_result]
    }
```

3. In the **DEPLOY** section, choose **Deploy** to update your function's code:

![Deploy button in the Lambda console code editor](images/getting-started-tutorial/deploy-console.png)

###### Understanding your durable function code

Before you move to the next step, let's look at the function code and understand key durable function concepts.

- The `@durable_execution` decorator:

Your handler function is decorated with `@durable_execution`. This decorator enables durable execution by providing
the `DurableContext` object and managing checkpoint operations.

- The `@durable_step` decorator:

Each step function is decorated with `@durable_step`. This decorator marks the function as a durable step that creates
checkpoints.

- The `DurableContext` object:

Instead of the standard Lambda context, your function receives a `DurableContext`. This object provides methods for
durable operations like `step()` and `wait()` that create checkpoints.

- Steps and checkpoints:

Each `context.step()` call creates a checkpoint before and after execution. If your function is interrupted, it resumes
from the last completed checkpoint. The function doesn't re-execute completed steps. It uses their stored results instead.

- Wait operations:

The `context.wait()` call pauses execution without consuming compute resources. When the wait completes, Lambda invokes
your function again and replays the checkpoint log, substituting stored values for completed steps.

- Python SDK is synchronous:

Note that the Python SDK doesn't use `await`. All durable operations are synchronous method calls.

## Invoke the durable function using the console code editor

When no explicit version is specified (or published), the console invokes the durable function using the `$LATEST` version qualifier.
However, for deterministic execution of your code, you must always use a qualified ARN pointing to a stable version.

###### To publish a version of your function

1. Choose the **Versions** tab.
2. Choose **Publish new version**.
3. For **Version description**, enter `Initial version` (optional).
4. Choose **Publish**.
5. Lambda creates version 1 of your function. Note that the function ARN now includes `:1` at the end, indicating this is version 1.

Now create a test event to send to your function. The event is a JSON formatted document containing an order ID.

###### To create the test event

1. In the **TEST EVENTS** section of the console code editor, choose **Create test event**.

![Create test event button in the Lambda console code editor](images/getting-started-tutorial/test-event.png) 2. For **Event Name**, enter `myTestEvent`. 3. In the **Event JSON** section, replace the default JSON with the following:

```
{
  "orderId": "order-12345"
}
```

4. Choose **Save**.

**To test your durable function and view execution**

In the **TEST EVENTS** section of the console code editor, choose the run icon next to your test event:

![Run test event button in the Lambda console code editor](images/getting-started-tutorial/run-test-event.png)

Your durable function starts executing. Because it includes a 10-second wait, the initial invocation completes quickly, and the function
resumes after the wait period. You can view the execution progress in the **Durable executions** tab.

###### To view your durable function execution

1. Choose the **Durable executions** tab.
2. Find your execution in the list. The execution shows the current status (Running, Succeeded, or Failed).
3. Choose the execution ID to view details, including:

   - Execution timeline showing when each step completed
   - Checkpoint history
   - Wait periods
   - Step results

You can also view your function's logs in CloudWatch Logs to see the console output from each step.

###### To view your function's invocation records in CloudWatch Logs

1. Open the [Log groups](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/home#logs: "https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/home#logs:") page of the CloudWatch console.
2. Choose the log group for your function (`/aws/lambda/myDurableFunction`).
3. Scroll down and choose the **Log stream** for the function invocations you want to look at.

![List of log streams for a Lambda function.](images/log-stream.png)

You should see log entries for each invocation of your function, including the initial execution and the replay after the wait.

###### Note

When you use the logger from the `DurableContext` (such as `context.logger` or `stepContext.logger`), logs also appear in the durable execution and step views in the Lambda console. These logs may take a moment to load.

## Clean up

When you're finished working with the example durable function, delete it. You can also delete the log group that stores
the function's logs, and the [execution role](lambda-intro-execution-role.md "lambda-intro-execution-role.md") that the console created.

###### To delete the Lambda function

1. Open the [Functions page](https://console.aws.amazon.com/lambda/home#/functions "https://console.aws.amazon.com/lambda/home#/functions") of the Lambda console.
2. Select the function that you created.
3. Choose **Actions**, **Delete**.
4. Type `confirm` in the text input field and choose **Delete**.

###### To delete the log group

1. Open the [Log groups](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/home#logs: "https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/home#logs:") page of the CloudWatch
   console.
2. Select the function's log group (`/aws/lambda/myDurableFunction`).
3. Choose **Actions**, **Delete log group(s)**.
4. In the **Delete log group(s)** dialog box, choose **Delete**.

###### To delete the execution role

1. Open the [Roles page](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?#/roles "https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?#/roles") of the AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)
   console.
2. Select the function's execution role (for example, `myDurableFunction-role-`31exxmpl``).
3. Choose **Delete**.
4. In the **Delete role** dialog box, enter the role name, and then choose **Delete**.
