This section describes how to debug and troubleshoot common issues when working with AWS Lambda MicroVMs.

## Shell access
<a name="microvms-troubleshooting-shell"></a>

Use shell access to connect directly to a running MicroVM for debugging and troubleshooting.

You can connect to a MicroVM shell in two ways:
+ **Console** – Select your MicroVM in the Lambda console and choose Connect.
+ **CLI** – Generate a shell token with `create-microvm-shell-auth-token`, then use the token to establish a connection.

Generate a shell token, then connect:

```
aws lambda-microvms create-microvm-shell-auth-token \
  --microvm-identifier <id> --expiration-in-minutes 30
# In Console: select MicroVM -> Connect
# In shell: ctr task ls, then ctr task exec -t --exec-id shell <id> /bin/sh
```

The MicroVM must have been run with the `SHELL_INGRESS` network connector (`arn:aws:lambda:{{us-east-1}}:aws:network-connector:aws-network-connector:SHELL_INGRESS`). If the MicroVM was not launched with this connector, `create-microvm-shell-auth-token` returns a `ValidationException`.

For other issues:
+ Check the `terminationMessage` field in the `get-microvm` response for terminated MicroVMs.
+ Check CloudWatch build logs for image creation issues.
+ Check the `StateReason` field for network connectors in `FAILED` state.

This section provides solutions for common issues when working with Lambda MicroVMs.


| Symptom | Possible cause and resolution | 
| --- | --- | 
| Image build fails (CREATION\_FAILED) | Check build logs at /aws/lambda/microvms/<image-name>. Verify Dockerfile syntax, Amazon S3 permissions, and base image availability. Run docker build locally to reproduce. | 
| MicroVM stuck in PENDING | Wait and retry. If persistent, check service health. Verify your concurrency quota is not exhausted. | 
| Application not responding after resume | Implement the /resume lifecycle hook to re-establish connections and validate state. Check that your app binds to port 8080 (or configured port) after resume. | 
| 502 Bad Gateway from endpoint | Application crashed or is not listening. Check runtime logs. Verify EXPOSE and CMD in Dockerfile. If auto-resume, the MicroVM may have failed to resume (check state by using get-microvm). | 
| 429 Too Many Requests | Request rate exceeded. Retry with exponential backoff and jitter. | 
| Connections dropping | Idle timeout triggered. Implement ping/pong keepalives. Or extend maxIdleDurationSeconds in the idle policy. | 
| High latency on endpoint | Bandwidth saturation. Check if traffic exceeds the bandwidth capability for your MicroVM size. Scale up to a larger size. | 
| Auth token expired (403) | Tokens have a configurable expiration. Generate a new token before the old one expires. Implement token refresh logic in your client. | 
| VPC egress not working | Verify network connector is in ACTIVE state. Check security group rules allow outbound traffic. Confirm subnets have routes to your target resources. | 

## Common errors (image creation)
<a name="microvms-troubleshooting-image-errors"></a>


| Error | Cause | Solution | 
| --- | --- | --- | 
| S3\_ACCESS\_DENIED | Build role lacks permissions to retrieve Amazon S3 artifact. | Add s3:GetObject permission for your artifact bucket. | 
| S3\_NO\_SUCH\_KEY | Artifact key does not exist in the bucket. | Verify the Amazon S3 path is correct. | 
| S3\_NO\_SUCH\_BUCKET | Amazon S3 bucket does not exist. | Check the bucket name and confirm it has been created. | 
| S3\_INVALID\_OBJECT | Artifact in Glacier or non-directly-accessible storage class. | Move the artifact to Standard storage class. | 
| S3\_CROSS\_REGION\_ACCESS\_DENIED | Artifact is in a different Region than the MicroVM image. | Ensure your artifact is in the same Region as your MicroVM image. | 
| ARCHIVE\_DOCKERFILE\_NOT\_FOUND | Zip archive is missing a Dockerfile in the root directory. | Add a Dockerfile to the root of your zip archive. | 
| ARCHIVE\_INVALID | Archive file is not a valid ZIP or is corrupted. | Re-create the zip archive and re-upload. | 
| CONTAINER\_BUILD\_FAILED | Invalid Dockerfile instructions, missing files, or syntax errors. | Debug your Dockerfile locally using docker build. | 
| DISK\_STORAGE\_FULL | MicroVM ran out of storage during build. | Reduce artifact size or contact support. | 
| INTERNAL\_PLATFORM\_ERROR | An internal error occurred. | Retry the operation. If persistent, contact support. | 

## Network connector troubleshooting
<a name="microvms-troubleshooting-connector-errors"></a>


| Error code | Cause | Solution | 
| --- | --- | --- | 
| DisallowedByVpcEncryptionControl | The VPC has an encryption control policy that prevents unencrypted network interfaces or traffic. Lambda cannot create ENIs that satisfy the encryption requirements. | Add Lambda to the VPC encryption control exclusion list. If exclusion is not possible, use a VPC or subnet that does not have restrictive encryption controls applied. | 
| Ec2RequestLimitExceeded | Lambda makes EC2 API calls (for example, CreateNetworkInterface, DescribeSubnets) to set up connectivity. Too many concurrent EC2 API calls causes throttling. | Retry the operation after a short delay. If persistent, reduce concurrent network connector operations or request an EC2 API throttling limit increase through AWS Support. | 
| InsufficientRolePermissions | The operator role lacks required EC2 permissions. | Ensure the IAM role has necessary EC2 networking permissions. | 
| InternalError | An unexpected error occurred within the Lambda service while processing the network connector request. | Retry the operation. If it persists after multiple retries, contact AWS Support with the network connector ARN and approximate timestamp. | 
| InvalidSecurityGroup | The security group ID does not exist, has been deleted, or does not belong to the same VPC as the specified subnets. | Verify all security group IDs exist and belong to the same VPC as the subnets. Use aws ec2 describe-security-groups --group-ids <sg-id> to validate. | 
| InvalidSubnet | The subnet ID does not exist, has been deleted, or belongs to a different VPC than expected. | Verify all subnet IDs exist and belong to the correct VPC. Use aws ec2 describe-subnets --subnet-ids <subnet-id> to validate. | 
| SubnetOutOfIPAddresses | The subnet's CIDR block is exhausted – all IPs are allocated to ENIs, instances, and other resources, so Lambda cannot create a network interface. | Free up IP addresses by removing unused ENIs/instances, or use a different subnet with available capacity. Consider larger subnets (for example, /24 or larger) for network connectors. |
