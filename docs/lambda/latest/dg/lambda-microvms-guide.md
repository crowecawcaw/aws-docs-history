# AWS Lambda MicroVMs

If you're building an application where multiple users or AI agents
connect to a compute environment and run code (for example, interactive
development environments, CI/CD systems, or sandboxes for AI) – you
need compute environments that start fast, stay isolated between tenants, and
don't require you to manage servers or networking.

AWS Lambda MicroVMs are purpose-built for these use cases. They are
serverless compute environments that provide VM-level isolation with full
operating system capabilities (for example, installing system packages or
mounting filesystems), snapshot-based rapid startup speeds, and fine-grained
control over ingress networking (port access, support for HTTP/2, gRPC,
WebSockets) and egress networking (public internet access and VPC
access).

For interactive use cases such as interactive development environments and
AI sandboxes, environments can experience long periods of idleness when
end-users context switch to other tasks or when waiting for AI. MicroVMs can
be suspended when idle, preserving memory and disk state while reducing
costs. When traffic arrives, they are resumed. You can enable automatic or
programmatic suspend-resume to lower idle costs, while maintaining
near-instant readiness when your end-users return.

AWS Lambda MicroVMs deliver these core capabilities through Firecracker
virtualization, which powers Lambda Functions' 15 trillion+ monthly
invocations.

To get started, see [Create your first MicroVM](microvms-getting-started.md "microvms-getting-started.md"). For pricing information,
see [AWS Lambda
Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/pricing/ "https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/pricing/").

## How Lambda MicroVMs work

1. You package your application code and a
   `Dockerfile` into a zip archive and upload it to Amazon S3.
2. You call the Lambda API to create a MicroVM image. Lambda executes
   your `Dockerfile`, starts your application, and captures a
   snapshot of the fully initialized environment.
3. When your application needs an isolated environment – for a
   user session, a job, or a sandbox – you call
   `run-microvm`. Lambda launches a MicroVM from the snapshot
   with rapid startup times.
4. Clients connect to the running MicroVM through its dedicated HTTPS
   endpoint. No load balancers or ingress infrastructure required.
5. When idle, the MicroVM suspends, preserving memory and disk state
   while reducing costs. It resumes with memory and disk state intact when
   traffic returns. Suspend-resume behavior can be configured automatically
   through lifecycle policies or triggered directly through API invocations to
   `suspend-microvm` and `resume-microvm`.
6. When the session ends, you terminate the MicroVM to release all
   resources.

## When to use Lambda MicroVMs

Lambda MicroVMs is a good fit for use cases that execute user or
AI-generated code and require execution environments that offer strong
isolation, rapid launch and resume latency, and developer control over
environment lifecycle and state retention. Typical use cases include:

- **Interactive code environments**
  – Development environments where users write and execute code in
  real time.
- **AI code execution sandboxes**
  – Ephemeral sandboxes for executing AI-generated code
  safely.
- **Data analytics applications** –
  Jupyter notebooks and ephemeral data processing workloads that execute
  user-supplied scripts.
- **Security scanning** –
  Vulnerability assessment tools that need isolated execution
  environments.
- **Reinforcement learning environments**
  – Isolated sandboxes for AI agent evaluation and training, where
  fresh environments are spun up for every run.
- **Multi-tenant CI/CD** – Task
  executors that require isolation between tenants.
- **Game servers** – Hosting
  environments that execute user-supplied scripts with strong
  isolation.

## Key features

- **Rapid startup** – MicroVMs
  resume from pre-initialized snapshots, skipping application
  initialization. See [MicroVM Images](microvms-images.md "microvms-images.md").
- **Lifecycle control** –
  Suspend, resume, and terminate MicroVMs programmatically or
  automatically through configurable idle policies. See [Running MicroVMs](microvms-launching.md "microvms-launching.md").
- **Flexible networking** –
  MicroVMs support inbound HTTPS traffic on configurable ports, with
  service-provided JWE authentication. Outbound access is configurable.
  Access the public internet or your VPC. For details, see the chapter on
  [Networking](microvms-networking.md "microvms-networking.md").
- **Flexible resource allocation**
  – Provision each MicroVM for baseline or average usage, with the
  flexibility to vertically scale to 4x of configured baseline during
  peak activity. Pay the baseline rate while your MicroVM is running and
  only pay for active use above the baseline.
