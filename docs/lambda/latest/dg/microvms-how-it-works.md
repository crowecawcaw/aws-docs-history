# AWS Lambda MicroVMs core concepts

AWS Lambda MicroVMs uses several resource types that you create and manage.
This page describes each resource type, how Lambda builds your MicroVM image
into a snapshot, and the lifecycle states a MicroVM transitions through at
runtime – the foundation for building applications with
MicroVMs.

## Key concepts

**MicroVM**

A MicroVM is a resource that represents an isolated compute
environment for a single tenant, user session, or job. Each MicroVM
runs an Amazon Linux 2023 operating system with operating system
capabilities, providing near-instant launch and resume. MicroVMs
receive requests through inbound HTTPS connections and can be
suspended when idle, preserving memory and disk state. A suspended
MicroVM resumes when traffic returns.

**MicroVM image**

A MicroVM image is a resource that defines the application
environment of a MicroVM. When you create an image, Lambda builds it
into a snapshot that enables near-instant launch (see
[How Lambda builds your image](#microvms-build-process "#microvms-build-process") below).

To create a MicroVM image, you provide a zip package containing a
`Dockerfile` and your application artifacts, uploaded to
Amazon S3. You must use a Lambda-published managed base image as the
foundation – specify it with the `base-image-arn`
parameter. Your `Dockerfile` defines the application layers
that Lambda builds on top of the managed base.

MicroVM images are versioned. Each version represents a single
build produced from a specific code artifact and base image. A version
progresses through build states (`PENDING` →
`IN_PROGRESS` → `SUCCESSFUL` or
`FAILED`), and successful versions can be set to
`ACTIVE` or `INACTIVE`. For details on image
states and management, see [MicroVM Images](microvms-images.md "microvms-images.md").

**Network connectors**

Network connectors are resources that control how traffic reaches
your MicroVM and how your MicroVM reaches external services. You
associate connectors with a MicroVM at run time to configure inbound
and outbound access independently.

Build-time and run-time connectors can differ, enabling your
MicroVM to reach different environments during image build versus
runtime.

Use Lambda-provided defaults for inbound port access (with JWE
authentication), shell access, and public internet egress. Create your
own network connector to route outbound traffic through your
VPC.

## How Lambda builds your image

When you create or update a MicroVM image, Lambda performs a build
process that produces a Firecracker snapshot. This snapshot captures the
fully initialized state of your application, enabling near-instant launch
and resume for MicroVMs that run from it.

The build process:

1. Lambda provisions a fresh MicroVM using the managed base image you
   specified.
2. Lambda executes your `Dockerfile` instructions to install
   dependencies and configure your environment.
3. Lambda starts your application using the `ENTRYPOINT` or
   `CMD` command.
4. If you enabled the `/ready` hook, Lambda waits for your
   application to signal readiness (HTTP 200).
5. Lambda captures a snapshot of the disk and memory state, including
   all running processes.

When you run a MicroVM, Lambda restores it from this snapshot. Your
application resumes from its pre-initialized state without repeating
startup.

If your application generates unique content during the build (such as
unique IDs, secrets, or network connections), that content is shared across
all MicroVMs run from the same image version. To avoid this, generate
unique content after the MicroVM starts using the `/run`
lifecycle hook. For details, see the snapshot compatibility section in
[MicroVM Images](microvms-images.md "microvms-images.md").

## MicroVM lifecycle

At runtime, a MicroVM transitions through the following stages:

1. **Run** – You call
   `run-microvm`. Lambda restores the MicroVM from the image
   snapshot, assigns a unique ID, and creates an endpoint. The MicroVM
   transitions from `PENDING` to
   `RUNNING`.
2. **Running** – Your application
   receives and processes requests through its endpoint URL.
3. **Suspend** – After a
   configurable idle period (or through the `suspend-microvm` API),
   the MicroVM transitions through `SUSPENDING` to
   `SUSPENDED`. Memory and disk state are preserved.
4. **Resume** – The MicroVM
   transitions from `SUSPENDED` directly back to
   `RUNNING` when traffic arrives (if
   `autoResumeEnabled=true`) or you call
   `resume-microvm`.
5. **Terminate** – The MicroVM
   transitions through `TERMINATING` to
   `TERMINATED` when you call
   `terminate-microvm` or the maximum duration is
   exceeded.

### States

The following table describes each MicroVM state. These states enable
you to build reliable applications and implement proper error
handling.

| State         | Description                                                                                              |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `PENDING`     | MicroVM is being provisioned. Resources are being allocated<br>and the snapshot is loading.              |
| `RUNNING`     | MicroVM is active and accepting traffic through its endpoint<br>URL. The `/run` hook has completed.      |
| `SUSPENDING`  | MicroVM is being suspended. The `/suspend` hook is<br>executing. Disk and memory are being checkpointed. |
| `SUSPENDED`   | MicroVM is suspended. State is preserved. No compute charges<br>accrue. Can be resumed or terminated.    |
| `TERMINATING` | MicroVM is being terminated. The `/terminate` hook<br>is executing. Resources are being released.        |
| `TERMINATED`  | MicroVM has been terminated. This is a terminal state. The<br>MicroVM cannot be resumed or restarted.    |

### State transitions

The following table shows the valid transitions between MicroVM states
and what triggers each transition.

| Initial state | Target state  | Trigger                                                                              |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `PENDING`     | `RUNNING`     | Provisioning complete, `/run` hook<br>succeeded.                                     |
| `RUNNING`     | `SUSPENDING`  | Idle duration exceeded, or explicit<br>`suspend-microvm` API call.                   |
| `SUSPENDING`  | `SUSPENDED`   | `/suspend` hook completed, memory and disk state<br>checkpointed.                    |
| `SUSPENDED`   | `RUNNING`     | Traffic arrives (`autoResumeEnabled=true`) or<br>explicit `resume-microvm` API call. |
| `RUNNING`     | `TERMINATING` | Explicit `terminate-microvm` API call, or<br>`maximumDurationInSeconds` exceeded.    |
| `SUSPENDED`   | `TERMINATING` | `suspendedDurationSeconds` exceeded, or explicit<br>`terminate-microvm` API call.    |
| `TERMINATING` | `TERMINATED`  | `/terminate` hook completed, all resources<br>released.                              |

###### Important

If your `/run` hook fails or times out, the MicroVM may
transition directly to `TERMINATING` without ever reaching
`RUNNING`. Implement timeout and error handling in your hooks
to avoid silent failures.
