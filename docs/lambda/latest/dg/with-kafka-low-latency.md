# Low latency processing for Kafka event

sources

AWS Lambda natively supports low latency event processing for applications that require
consistent end-to-end latencies of less than 100 milliseconds. This page provides
configuration details and recommendations to enable low latency workflows.

## Enable low latency processing

To enable low latency processing on a Kafka event source mapping, the following basic
configuration is required:

- Enable provisioned mode. For more information, see [Configuring provisioned mode](with-kafka-process.md#services-kafka-provisioned-mode "with-kafka-process.md#services-kafka-provisioned-mode").
- Set the event source mapping's `MaximumBatchingWindowInSeconds`
  parameter to 0. For more information, see [Batching behavior](invocation-eventsourcemapping.md#invocation-eventsourcemapping-batching "invocation-eventsourcemapping.md#invocation-eventsourcemapping-batching").

## Fine-tuning your low latency Kafka ESM

Consider the following recommendations to optimize your Kafka event source mapping for
low latency:

### Provisioned mode configuration

In provisioned mode for Kafka event source mapping, Lambda allows you to fine-tune
the throughput of your event source mapping by configuring a minimum and maximum
number of resources called **event pollers**. An event
poller (or **a poller**) represents a compute resource
that underpins an event source mapping in the provisioned mode, and allocates up to
5 MB/s throughput. Each event poller supports up to 5 concurrent Lambda
invocations.

To determine the optimal poller configuration for your application, consider your
peak ingestion rate and processing requirements. Let's look at a simplified
example:

With a batch size of 20 records and an average target function duration of 50ms,
each poller can handle 2,000 records per second subject to 5 MB/s limit. This is
calculated as: (20 records × 1000ms/50ms) × 5 concurrent Lambda invocations.
Therefore, if your desired peak ingestion rate is 20,000 records per second, you
would need at least 10 event pollers.

###### Note

We recommend to provision additional event pollers as buffer to avoid
consistently operating at maximum capacity.

Provisioned mode automatically scales your event pollers based on traffic patterns
within configured minimum and maximum **event pollers**
which can trigger rebalance, and therefore, introduce additional latency. You can
disable auto-scaling by configuring same value for minimum and maximum **event poller**.

### Additional considerations

Some of the additional considerations include:

- Cold starts from the invocation of your Lambda target function can potentially increase
  end-to-end latency. To reduce this risk, consider enabling [provisioned concurrency](provisioned-concurrency.md "provisioned-concurrency.md") or
  [SnapStart](snapstart.md "snapstart.md") on your event source
  mapping's target function. Additionally, optimize your function's memory
  allocation to ensure consistent and optimal executions.
- When `MaximumBatchingWindowInSeconds` is set to 0, Lambda will
  immediately process any available records without waiting to fill the
  complete batch size. For example, if your batch size is set to 1,000 records
  but only 100 records are available, Lambda will process those 100 records
  immediately rather than waiting for the full 1,000 records to
  accumulate.

###### Important

The optimal configuration for low latency processing varies significantly
based on your specific workload. We strongly recommend testing different
configurations with your actual workload to determine the best settings for your
use case.
