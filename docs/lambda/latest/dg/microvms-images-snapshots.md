# Working with snapshots

When AWS Lambda MicroVMs builds a MicroVM image, it captures a Firecracker
snapshot of your fully initialized application. This page describes what a
snapshot contains, how to handle uniqueness across MicroVMs that share the
same snapshot, and best practices for snapshot-compatible applications.

## What a snapshot captures

A Firecracker snapshot captures the following state from your MicroVM at
the moment the image build completes:

- **Memory state of running processes**
  – All processes launched by `ENTRYPOINT`/`CMD`,
  including background daemons, cron jobs, and child processes.
- **Disk state** – The root
  filesystem including all files written during the build phase (installed
  packages, compiled binaries, configuration files).
- **Network connections and file
  descriptors** – Any initialized network connections, file
  handles, pipes, and other descriptors.

When you run a MicroVM, Lambda restores it from this snapshot. Your
application resumes exactly where MicroVM image version build left
off.

## Compatibility considerations

Because all MicroVMs launched from the same image version share
identical initial state, consider the following when building applications
with Lambda MicroVMs:

- **Uniqueness** – If your code
  generates unique content during image version build phase (unique IDs,
  secrets, or entropy for pseudorandomness), that content is shared across
  all MicroVMs run from the same image version. Generate unique content
  after a new MicroVM starts, not during image build. Use the
  `/run` lifecycle hook to reset previously generated unique
  content.
- **Network connections** –
  Connections established during the image version build phase might need to
  be re-established when a MicroVM is run from the image version. Validate
  connection state and re-establish connections as necessary. In most
  cases, connections created by AWS SDKs are automatically
  re-established.

## Handling uniqueness with snapshots

All MicroVMs run from the same image share identical initial state.
To maintain uniqueness across MicroVMs:

- Generate unique IDs, secrets, and random values after a MicroVM has
  been started and not during image version build. Use the
  `/run` lifecycle hook to reset any unique state.
- Use cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generators
  (CSPRNGs) for your programming language. Verify that your
  language-standard cryptographic library receives its entropy from the
  `/dev/random` device or `/dev/urandom` device.
  This is default behavior for cryptographic libraries for popular
  programming languages like Java 11+ (SecureRandom library), Node.js
  (crypto.randomBytes library), Python 3.12+ (Secrets.SystemRandom
  library), and Dotnet8+ (Cryptography.RandomNumberGenerator library).
  Software that reads from `/dev/random` or
  `/dev/urandom` maintains randomness when used with MicroVM
  image snapshots.
- If your application code uses OpenSSL, use the AWS-provided base
  container image from
  `public.ecr.aws/lambda/microvms:al2023-minimal` to build
  your MicroVM image. This image contains an AWS-patched version of
  OpenSSL that is compatible with snapshotting. If you wish to use your
  own base image with OpenSSL, use the patched version of OpenSSL
  (openssl-snapsafe-libs) listed in [the
  Amazon Linux 2023 package list](../../../linux/al2023/release-notes/all-packages.md "../../../linux/al2023/release-notes/all-packages.md").
