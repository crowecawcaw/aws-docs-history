# Create your first Lambda MicroVM

This tutorial walks you through creating a AWS Lambda MicroVM image and
running a MicroVM from it. By the end, you'll have a running application
accessible over HTTPS.

## Prerequisites

You need two things before you start:

1. **An Amazon S3 bucket** in your preferred
   AWS Region to store your application artifact (the zip file you'll
   create in Step 2).
2. **An IAM build role** that Lambda
   assumes during image creation. Lambda uses this role to download your
   code artifact from Amazon S3 and write build logs to CloudWatch.

Create the IAM role with the following trust policy. This allows the
Lambda service to assume the role:

```
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [{
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Principal": { "Service": "lambda.amazonaws.com" },
    "Action": ["sts:AssumeRole", "sts:TagSession"]
  }]
}
```

Attach the following permissions policy to the role. Replace
`<your-bucket-name>` with your Amazon S3 bucket name:

```
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": ["s3:GetObject"],
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::<your-bucket-name>/*"
    },
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": ["logs:CreateLogGroup", "logs:CreateLogStream", "logs:PutLogEvents"],
      "Resource": "arn:aws:logs:*:*:*"
    }
  ]
}
```

###### Note

If your `Dockerfile` pulls from a private AWS ECR
repository, also add `ecr:GetAuthorizationToken` and
`ecr:BatchGetImage` to the permissions policy.

## Creating your first MicroVM image

A MicroVM image captures your application in a fully initialized state.
When you run a MicroVM from this image, your application starts immediately
– no boot or initialization delay.

### Step 1: Write your application and Dockerfile

Create a simple HTTP server that runs inside your MicroVM. This
example uses Node.js with no external dependencies:

**`app.js`**

```
// Minimal HTTP server — listens on port 8080
const http = require('http');

const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  res.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' });
  res.end(JSON.stringify({ status: 'ok', path: req.url }));
});

server.listen(8080, () => {
  console.log('Listening on port 8080');
});
```

Next, create a `Dockerfile` that packages and starts your
application:

**`Dockerfile`**

```
# Use a lightweight Node.js runtime for your application layers
FROM node:24-alpine

# Set the working directory inside the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy your application code
COPY app.js .

# Declare the port your app listens on
EXPOSE 8080

# Start the application — Lambda snapshots the running state
CMD ["node", "app.js"]
```

###### Note

The `FROM` instruction sets the container image for your
application layers. You can use any compatible container image. The
Lambda managed base image (which provides the MicroVM operating system
and service components) is specified separately with
`--base-image-arn` in Step 3.

If your application generates unique values (IDs, secrets, or
cryptographic material), use your language's standard cryptographically
secure pseudorandom number generator (CSPRNG) library to
ensure uniqueness across MicroVMs. If your application uses OpenSSL,
use the Lambda base container image which includes a
snapshot-compatible version. For details, see the snapshot compatibility
section in [MicroVM Images](microvms-images.md "microvms-images.md").

### Step 2: Package and upload to Amazon S3

Package your `app.js` and `Dockerfile` into a
zip archive, then upload it to your Amazon S3 bucket. Run the following
commands in your terminal:

```
zip app.zip app.js Dockerfile
aws s3 cp app.zip s3://`your-bucket-name`/app.zip
```

### Step 3: Create the MicroVM image

Call `create-microvm-image` to start the build. Lambda
downloads your zip from Amazon S3, runs your `Dockerfile`, starts
your application, and captures a Firecracker snapshot of the fully
initialized state:

```
aws lambda-microvms create-microvm-image \
  --name my-first-microvm-image \
  --code-artifact uri=s3://`your-bucket-name`/app.zip \
  --base-image-arn arn:aws:lambda:`us-east-1`:aws:microvm-image:al2023-1 \
  --build-role-arn arn:aws:iam::`123456789012`:role/MicrovmBuildRole
```

The image starts in `CREATING` state. Check the build
status with:

```
aws lambda-microvms get-microvm-image \
  --image-identifier my-first-microvm-image
```

When the build completes, the `state` field changes to
`CREATED`:

```
{
  "imageName": "my-first-microvm-image",
  "imageArn": "arn:aws:lambda:us-east-1:123456789012:microvm-image:my-first-microvm-image",
  "state": "CREATED",
  "imageVersion": "1.0",
  ...
}
```

If the state is `CREATE_FAILED`, check the build logs in
CloudWatch under `/aws/lambda/microvms/my-first-microvm-image`.

## Running your first MicroVM

Once your MicroVM image reaches `CREATED` state, you can run
MicroVMs from it. Each image can launch many MicroVMs – one per
tenant, user session, or job.

Run a MicroVM with the following command:

```
aws lambda-microvms run-microvm \
  --image-identifier my-first-microvm-image \
  --ingress-network-connectors "arn:aws:lambda:`us-east-1`:aws:network-connector:aws-network-connector:ALL_INGRESS" \
  --egress-network-connectors "arn:aws:lambda:`us-east-1`:aws:network-connector:aws-network-connector:INTERNET_EGRESS" \
  --idle-policy '{"autoResumeEnabled":true,"maxIdleDurationSeconds":900,"suspendedDurationSeconds":300}'
```

Parameters explained:

- `--ingress-network-connectors` – Enables inbound
  HTTPS traffic to your MicroVM on all ports. This is a Lambda-managed
  connector.
- `--egress-network-connectors` – Enables outbound
  internet access from your MicroVM. This is a Lambda-managed
  connector.
- `--idle-policy` – Configures automatic
  suspend-resume behavior. This policy suspends the MicroVM after 15
  minutes of inactivity, keeps it suspended for up to 5 minutes, and
  resumes automatically when traffic arrives.

The response includes the MicroVM ID and endpoint URL:

```
{
  "microvmId": "mvm-01234567-abcd-ef01-2345-6789abcdef01",
  "state": "PENDING",
  "endpoint": "mvm-01234567-abcd-ef01-2345-6789abcdef01.lambda-microvm.us-east-1.on.aws",
  ...
}
```

Wait for the state to reach `RUNNING`:

```
aws lambda-microvms get-microvm \
  --microvm-identifier mvm-01234567-abcd-ef01-2345-6789abcdef01
```

## Connecting to your MicroVM

All requests to a MicroVM endpoint require an authentication token.
Generate one with:

```
aws lambda-microvms create-microvm-auth-token \
  --microvm-identifier mvm-01234567-abcd-ef01-2345-6789abcdef01 \
  --expiration-in-minutes 30 \
  --allowed-ports '[{"allPorts":{}}]'
```

The response includes a token in the `authToken` field. Use
it to send a request to your running application:

```
curl https://mvm-01234567-abcd-ef01-2345-6789abcdef01.lambda-microvm.us-east-1.on.aws/ \
  -H "X-aws-proxy-auth: `<token-value>`"
```

You should see the response from your application:

```
{"status":"ok","path":"/"}
```

Your MicroVM is running and serving traffic. The application you wrote
in Step 1 is live at the endpoint URL.

## Clean up

To avoid ongoing charges, terminate the MicroVM when you're done:

```
aws lambda-microvms terminate-microvm \
  --microvm-identifier mvm-01234567-abcd-ef01-2345-6789abcdef01
```
