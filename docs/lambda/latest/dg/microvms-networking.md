# Networking

You configure network access for your AWS Lambda MicroVMs by associating
Network Connector resources with your MicroVM at run time. Network connectors
are specified when you call `run-microvm` and cannot be changed
while a MicroVM is running.

## Overview

Each MicroVM can have independent ingress (inbound) and egress (outbound)
network configurations:

- **Ingress network connectors** enable
  inbound connectivity. Clients connect to a service-managed HTTPS
  endpoint, and Lambda forwards traffic to ports you configure within the
  MicroVM. Ingress connectors are AWS-managed – you reference them
  by ARN when running a MicroVM.
- **Egress network connectors** enable
  outbound traffic. By default, MicroVMs have public internet access. You
  can create a customer-managed VPC egress connector to route outbound
  traffic through your VPC instead.

A single connector can be reused across many MicroVMs – this is
the intended usage pattern.

## Inbound connectivity

Each Lambda MicroVM is reachable at a unique HTTPS endpoint URL, assigned
when you call `run-microvm`. Clients send requests to this
endpoint over HTTPS. Lambda routes each request to a port inside your MicroVM,
where your application receives it.

By default, requests received at the endpoint are routed to port 8080
inside the MicroVM. To route to a different port, see [Port routing](#microvms-networking-port-routing "#microvms-networking-port-routing").

The following protocols are supported on the inbound endpoint:

- HTTP/1.1
- HTTP/2
- WebSockets
- gRPC
- Server-Sent Events (SSE)

###### Note

Traffic between your client and the MicroVM endpoint is always
encrypted with TLS. Your application can serve requests over either HTTP or
HTTPS internally.

### Port routing

Lambda selects the target port inside your MicroVM using the following
order of priority:

1. **`X-aws-proxy-port`
   header** – For standard HTTP requests, include this
   header with the target port number.
2. **WebSocket subprotocol** – If
   your WebSocket client can't set custom headers, specify the target port
   as a subprotocol named
   `lambda-microvms.port.`N``, where
   `N` is the port number. You provide
   subprotocols when you open the WebSocket connection. For an example,
   see [Protocols](microvms-launching.md#microvms-launching-websocket "microvms-launching.md#microvms-launching-websocket").
3. **Default (8080)** – If neither
   is specified, requests route to port 8080.

###### Important

The target port must be within the `allowedPorts` defined
in the authentication token. Requests to unauthorized ports receive a 403
Forbidden response.

### Authentication

All requests to a MicroVM endpoint require a valid authentication token
in the `X-aws-proxy-auth` header. You generate tokens using
`create-microvm-auth-token`. Each token is an encrypted JWE
(JSON Web Encryption) string scoped to:

- A specific MicroVM (identified by ID).
- A set of allowed ports (single port, range, or all ports).
- An expiration time (configured at token creation).

The following example creates a token and uses it to send an
authenticated request:

```
aws lambda-microvms create-microvm-auth-token \
  --microvm-identifier `microvm-id` \
  --expiration-in-minutes 30 \
  --allowed-ports '[{"port":8080}]'
```

```
curl 'https://`microvm-endpoint`' \
  -H 'X-aws-proxy-auth: `TOKEN`' \
  -H 'X-aws-proxy-port: 8080'
```

For a complete walkthrough of creating tokens and connecting to a
MicroVM, including WebSocket connections, see [Connecting to a MicroVM](microvms-launching.md#microvms-launching-connecting "microvms-launching.md#microvms-launching-connecting").

### Error responses

The following HTTP status codes are returned by the MicroVM endpoint
when it cannot process or deliver a request to your application. These
responses come from the endpoint, not from your application.

| Code | Status                | Cause and resolution                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ---- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 400  | Bad Request           | Malformed request, or an invalid port header or WebSocket<br>subprotocol. Verify the format.                                                                                                                                               |
| 403  | Forbidden             | Missing, expired, or invalid token; or the requested port is<br>not in the token's `allowedPorts`. Generate a new token,<br>or use an allowed port.                                                                                        |
| 429  | Too Many Requests     | Rate limit exceeded (account-level or per-MicroVM). Retry with<br>exponential backoff.                                                                                                                                                     |
| 500  | Internal Server Error | An internal error occurred. Retry the request.                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 502  | Bad Gateway           | Application not responding, or auto-resume did not succeed<br>within the maximum number of retry attempts. See [Auto-resume](microvms-launching.md#microvms-launching-auto-resume "microvms-launching.md#microvms-launching-auto-resume"). |

### Request headers

The `X-aws-proxy-*` header namespace is reserved by Lambda
for request metadata, such as the authentication token
(`X-aws-proxy-auth`) and target port
(`X-aws-proxy-port`). Lambda removes
`X-aws-proxy-*` headers before forwarding the request to your
application.

### Request/response bandwidth

Each Lambda MicroVM has a request/response bandwidth that scales linearly
with its size. This bandwidth applies to all traffic through the MicroVM
endpoint, both inbound requests and outbound responses.

| MicroVM size (baseline) | Max bandwidth      |
| ----------------------- | ------------------ |
| 0.5 GB, 0.25 vCPU       | 1 MB/s (8 Mbps)    |
| 1 GB, 0.5 vCPU          | 2 MB/s (16 Mbps)   |
| 2 GB, 1 vCPU            | 4 MB/s (32 Mbps)   |
| 4 GB, 2 vCPU            | 8 MB/s (64 Mbps)   |
| 8 GB, 4 vCPU            | 16 MB/s (128 Mbps) |

If you experience increased request latency due to network saturation,
either reduce your request concurrency or payload size, or select a larger
MicroVM size to increase the available bandwidth.

### HTTP/2 support

Lambda MicroVMs supports HTTP/2 on the inbound endpoint. Lambda negotiates
the protocol through ALPN (Application-Layer Protocol Negotiation) during
the TLS handshake, preferring HTTP/2 and falling back to HTTP/1.1. An
HTTP/2-capable client uses it automatically.

To use HTTP/2 between the endpoint and your application inside the
MicroVM:

- **Your application serves TLS**
  – Lambda negotiates HTTP/2 with your application through ALPN,
  falling back to HTTP/1.1 if HTTP/2 isn't supported.
- **Your application serves plaintext
  HTTP** – Include the `X-aws-proxy-force-h2:
 true` header in your request to use HTTP/2 on the connection to
  your application.

## Outbound connectivity

By default, Lambda MicroVMs have public internet access on the egress
path. To connect MicroVMs with resources in your private VPCs – such as
RDS, ElastiCache, internal APIs, and on-premises systems through Direct
Connect or VPN – create a Lambda Network Connector with your VPC
configuration.

When using VPC egress, outbound traffic is subject to security group rules
and network ACLs governing traffic in your VPC.

## Working with egress network connectors

Egress network connectors route outbound traffic from your MicroVM
through your VPC. You create a connector once, then reference it by ARN when
starting MicroVMs through the `run-microvm` command.

### Prerequisites

Before creating a network connector, you need an IAM role that allows
Lambda to create elastic network interfaces (ENIs) in your VPC. The role
requires the following permissions:

```
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "CreateENI",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "ec2:CreateNetworkInterface",
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:ec2:*:*:network-interface/*",
        "arn:aws:ec2:*:*:subnet/*",
        "arn:aws:ec2:*:*:security-group/*"
      ]
    },
    {
      "Sid": "TagENI",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "ec2:CreateTags",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:ec2:*:*:network-interface/*",
      "Condition": {
        "StringEquals": {
          "ec2:ManagedResourceOperator": "network-connectors.lambda.amazonaws.com"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Creating a network connector

Create a connector by specifying your VPC subnets, security groups, and
network protocol (`IPv4` or `DualStack`):

```
aws lambda-core create-network-connector \
  --name my-connector \
  --configuration '{
    "VpcEgressConfiguration": {
      "SubnetIds": ["`subnet-xxx`"],
      "SecurityGroupIds": ["`sg-xxx`"],
      "NetworkProtocol": "IPv4",
      "AssociatedComputeResourceTypes": ["MicroVm"]
    }
  }' \
  --operator-role arn:aws:iam::`123456789012`:role/NetworkConnectorOperatorRole
```

### Network connector states

A connector must be in `ACTIVE` state before you can
reference it in `run-microvm`.

| State           | Description                                                            |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `PENDING`       | Connector is being created (underlying ENIs are being<br>provisioned). |
| `ACTIVE`        | Connector is ready to use.                                             |
| `INACTIVE`      | Connector is temporarily inactive.                                     |
| `FAILED`        | Provisioning or update failed. Check<br>`StateReason`.                 |
| `DELETING`      | Connector is being deleted; ENIs are being cleaned<br>up.              |
| `DELETE_FAILED` | Deletion failed.                                                       |

### Running a MicroVM with a network connector

Reference the connector ARN when running a MicroVM:

```
aws lambda-microvms run-microvm \
  --image-identifier arn:aws:lambda:us-east-1:`123456789012`:microvm-image:my-microvm-image \
  --egress-network-connectors `connector-arn` \
  --idle-policy '{"maxIdleDurationSeconds":900,"suspendedDurationSeconds":1800,"autoResumeEnabled":false}'
```

###### Note

Before you update or delete a connector, ensure all MicroVMs using it
have terminated. Modifying a connector that is actively in use can cause
network connectivity issues for running MicroVMs.
