# Self-managed S3 code storage

By default, when you create or update a Lambda function or layer from a .zip file archive, Lambda stores a copy of your code in Lambda-managed storage. Each AWS account has a 300 GB quota for Lambda-managed storage per Region.

With self-managed S3 code storage, you can configure Lambda to reference your code directly from an S3 bucket in your account. Lambda does not store a copy of your code, so the code does not count against your Lambda-managed storage quota. Lambda accesses your code directly from your S3 bucket.

Self-managed S3 code storage is available for all functions and layers created and updated using .zip file archives. It is compatible with all S3 storage classes except Glacier storage classes.

###### Note

Self-managed S3 code storage does not change the maximum .zip deployment package size, which remains at 250 MB (unzipped).

## Setting up self-managed S3 code storage

To use self-managed S3 code storage, complete the following steps:

1. Create an S3 bucket or use an existing bucket in your account.
2. Enable [S3 versioning](../../../AmazonS3/latest/userguide/Versioning.md "../../../AmazonS3/latest/userguide/Versioning.md") for the bucket. Lambda requires S3 versioning to track which version of your source object to use. Each time you upload a new .zip package, S3 creates a new version so Lambda can distinguish updates.
3. Upload your .zip deployment package to the S3 bucket.
4. Grant the Lambda service principal `s3:GetObject` and `s3:GetObjectVersion` permissions for the source object. See [Configuring permissions](#self-managed-storage-permissions "#self-managed-storage-permissions").
5. Create or update your function or layer, specifying the S3 object, S3 key, S3 object version, and setting `S3ObjectStorageMode` to `REFERENCE`.

## Configuring permissions

To use self-managed S3 code storage, grant the Lambda service principal (`lambda.amazonaws.com`) permission to access your source objects. Add the following S3 bucket policy:

```
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "LambdaSelfManagedCodeAccess",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "s3:GetObject",
        "s3:GetObjectVersion"
      ],
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:s3:::`my-bucket`/`my-function.zip`"
      ],
      "Principal": {
        "Service": "lambda.amazonaws.com"
      },
      "Condition": {
        "ArnLike": {
          "aws:SourceArn": "arn:aws:lambda:`us-east-1`:`111122223333`:function:`my-function`"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Creating a function with self-managed S3 storage

You can create a function with self-managed S3 code storage using the AWS CLI or AWS CloudFormation.

### Using the AWS CLI

Use the `create-function` command with the `S3ObjectStorageMode=REFERENCE` parameter:

```
`aws lambda create-function \
 --function-name my-function \
 --runtime python3.12 \
 --role arn:aws:iam::111122223333:role/lambda-execution-role \
 --handler lambda_function.lambda_handler \
 --code S3Bucket=`my-bucket`,\
S3Key=`my-function.zip`,\
S3ObjectVersion=`abc123def456`,\
S3ObjectStorageMode=REFERENCE`
```

To update an existing function to use self-managed S3 storage:

```
`aws lambda update-function-code \
 --function-name my-function \
 --s3-bucket `my-bucket` \
 --s3-key `my-function.zip` \
 --s3-object-version `abc123def456` \
 --s3-object-storage-mode REFERENCE`
```

###### Important

You must specify `S3ObjectStorageMode=REFERENCE` on every call to `update-function-code`. If you omit `S3ObjectStorageMode`, it defaults to `COPY` and Lambda stores your code in Lambda-managed storage.

### Using AWS CloudFormation

In your CloudFormation template, set `S3ObjectStorageMode` to `REFERENCE` in the `Code` property of the `AWS::Lambda::Function` resource:

```
Resources:
  MyFunction:
    Type: AWS::Lambda::Function
    Properties:
      FunctionName: my-function
      Runtime: python3.12
      Handler: lambda_function.lambda_handler
      Role: !GetAtt LambdaExecutionRole.Arn
      Code:
        S3Bucket: `my-bucket`
        S3Key: `my-function.zip`
        S3ObjectVersion: `abc123def456`
        S3ObjectStorageMode: REFERENCE
```

## Using self-managed S3 storage with layers

You can also use self-managed S3 code storage for layer versions. Use the `publish-layer-version` command with `S3ObjectStorageMode=REFERENCE`:

```
`aws lambda publish-layer-version \
 --layer-name my-layer \
 --content S3Bucket=`my-bucket`,S3Key=`my-layer.zip`,S3ObjectStorageMode=REFERENCE \
 --compatible-runtimes python3.12`
```

You can use any combination of Lambda-managed and self-managed storage for function code and layer code.

## Switching between storage modes

You can switch between Lambda-managed and self-managed S3 code storage when you update your function code or publish a new layer version. Set `S3ObjectStorageMode` to either `COPY` or `REFERENCE`:

- `COPY` (default) – Lambda copies your source code to Lambda-managed storage.
- `REFERENCE` – Lambda references your source code directly from your S3 bucket without storing a copy.

When you switch from `COPY` to `REFERENCE`, Lambda deletes the Lambda-managed copy of your source code. When you switch from `REFERENCE` to `COPY`, Lambda makes a copy of your source code in Lambda-managed storage. Switching to `COPY` fails if you exceed the Lambda-managed code storage limit.

## Function lifecycle with self-managed storage

Lambda periodically accesses the source object from your S3 bucket to reoptimize your function code. You must maintain access to the source object for your function to remain active.

- If Lambda loses access to the source object for a function, the function transitions to the `Inactive` state. To restore the function, restore access to the source object and update the function.
- If Lambda loses access to the source object for a layer, the function remains `Active`. You can update function configuration (without updating layers), update function code, or update function configuration with new layers. However, updating function configuration with the inaccessible layer fails.

## Cross-account and cross-Region usage

You can create functions and layers from source code in S3 buckets in different accounts and in different Regions. Cross-Region object retrieval incurs additional S3 data transfer costs. See [S3 pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing/ "https://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing/") for details.

## Considerations

- Self-managed S3 code storage is available for .zip file archive functions and layers only. Container image functions continue to use Amazon ECR.
- The maximum .zip deployment package size (250 MB unzipped) is unchanged.
- You pay standard Amazon S3 storage rates for code stored in your self-managed buckets. Lambda does not charge for S3 object retrieval within the same Region.
- Self-managed S3 code storage is compatible with all S3 storage classes except Glacier storage classes.
- You can use S3 features like S3 Cross-Region Replication to share artifacts across Regions and S3 lifecycle policies to manage objects.
