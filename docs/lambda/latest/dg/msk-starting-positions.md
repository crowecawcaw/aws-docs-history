# Polling and stream starting positions in Lambda

The [StartingPosition parameter](../api/API_CreateEventSourceMapping.md#lambda-CreateEventSourceMapping-request-StartingPosition "../api/API_CreateEventSourceMapping.md#lambda-CreateEventSourceMapping-request-StartingPosition") tells Lambda when to start reading messages from your stream. There are
three options to choose from:

- **Latest** – Lambda starts reading just after the most recent
  record in the Kafka topic.
- **Trim horizon** – Lambda starts reading from the last untrimmed
  record in the Kafka topic. This is also the oldest record in the topic.
- **At timestamp** – Lambda starts reading from a position defined
  by a timestamp, in Unix time seconds. Use the [StartingPositionTimestamp parameter](../api/API_CreateEventSourceMapping.md#lambda-CreateEventSourceMapping-request-StartingPositionTimestamp "../api/API_CreateEventSourceMapping.md#lambda-CreateEventSourceMapping-request-StartingPositionTimestamp") to specify the timestamp.
  Stream polling during an event source mapping create or update is eventually consistent:

- During event source mapping creation, it may take several minutes to start polling events
  from the stream.
- During event source mapping updates, it may take up to 90 seconds to stop and restart polling
  events from the stream.
  This behavior means that if you specify `LATEST` as the starting position for the stream, the event
  source mapping could miss events during a create or update. To ensure that no events are missed, specify either
  `TRIM_HORIZON` or `AT_TIMESTAMP`.
