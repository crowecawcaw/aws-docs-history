# Using Lambda MicroVMs as a sandbox for Claude Managed Agents

AWS Lambda MicroVMs is a managed sandbox provider in self-hosted sandboxes
for Claude Managed Agents; keeping sensitive files, packages, and services in
infrastructure you control. Anthropic hosts the agent loop and Claude model,
while the Lambda MicroVM is where your tool calls run. With this pattern, you
control the execution environment – what is installed, what network
access is available, and what resources the agent can reach.

Each MicroVM is a Firecracker-isolated virtual machine with
snapshot-based sub-second startup, runs for up to 8 hours, and can be
terminated when the session ends. Sessions never share state. You get the
security boundary of a VM with the operational model of serverless –
no clusters to manage, no idle capacity to pay for. You can orchestrate
MicroVMs with AWS services to implement the self-hosted sandbox spec as
described below. Review the [Claude
Managed Agents Self-Hosted Sandboxes on Lambda MicroVMs](https://github.com/aws-samples/sample-lambda-microvm-claude-managed-agents "https://github.com/aws-samples/sample-lambda-microvm-claude-managed-agents") reference
sample for more detail.

## How it works

A control plane launches one MicroVM per Claude session:

1. A session reaches the running state and Anthropic sends a
   `session.status_run_started` webhook to an endpoint
   in your account.
2. A launcher Lambda function verifies the webhook signature, then
   calls `RunMicroVM`.
3. Your code on the MicroVM claims the session, executes tool calls
   (bash, read, write, edit, glob, grep) in
   `/workspace`, and posts results back to Anthropic.
4. The MicroVM is suspended or terminated when the session
   ends.

Your Anthropic organization API key never reaches AWS compute. The
launcher only passes an AWS Secrets Manager reference to your Anthropic
environment key; the MicroVM's execution role allows the code to read it at
runtime.

| Firecracker isolation | Hardware-virtualized boundary per session                                 |
| Snapshot-based boot   | Resume from Firecracker snapshot in sub-second to single-digit<br>seconds |
| IAM through IMDSv2    | Uses short-term, least privilege credentials                              |
| Stateful duration     | Can run up to 8 hours with full disk and memory<br>access                 |
| Pay-per-session       | MicroVMs are terminated when sessions are complete, which ends<br>billing |

## Prerequisites

- An AWS account with permissions for Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3), AWS Identity and Access Management
  (IAM), Secrets Manager, , AWS WAF, Lambda, and Lambda
  MicroVMs
- A Claude Managed Agents agent with a
  `self_hosted` environment
- An environment key and webhook signing secret from the Claude
  Console

## Deploying the reference implementation

![Architecture diagram showing the Claude Self-Hosted Sandboxes on Lambda MicroVMs reference implementation](images/microvms-claude-managed-agents-architecture.png)

The [Claude
Managed Agents Self-Hosted Sandboxes on Lambda MicroVMs](https://github.com/aws-samples/sample-lambda-microvm-claude-managed-agents "https://github.com/aws-samples/sample-lambda-microvm-claude-managed-agents")
repository provides a minimal, working deployment. It includes:

- A CloudFormation stack (Amazon API Gateway, launcher Lambda function, Secrets Manager
  secrets, Amazon S3 bucket, IAM roles)
- A MicroVM image (`Dockerfile`, Node.js
  EnvironmentWorker, lifecycle hooks)
- A deploy script and verification script

Deployment steps:

1. Deploy the CloudFormation stack.
2. Store the environment key and signing secret in the created Secrets
   Manager secrets.
3. Build the MicroVM image.
4. Register the stack's webhook URL in the Claude Console.
5. Verify by creating a session.

For detailed instructions, see the repository README.

## Networking

Lambda MicroVMs have public internet access by default – no
configuration is needed to reach
`api.anthropic.com`.

To access private resources like an Amazon Aurora database or Amazon
ElastiCache cluster, or to apply your own network restrictions, attach a
VPC egress connector at launch time. See [Working with egress network connectors](microvms-networking.md#microvms-networking-connectors "microvms-networking.md#microvms-networking-connectors").

## Idle policy

Set `suspendedDurationSeconds: 0` and
`autoResumeEnabled: false` for per-session MicroVMs. Set
`maximumDurationInSeconds` as a ceiling for stuck sessions (max
28,800 s).

```
{
  "maxIdleDurationSeconds": 120,
  "suspendedDurationSeconds": 0,
  "autoResumeEnabled": false
}
```

## Monitoring

**Application logs** – Review
application logs in CloudWatch Logs:

```
aws logs tail /aws/lambda-microvms/claude-worker --follow
```

**Running MicroVMs** – List the
running MicroVMs in your account:

```
aws lambda-microvms list-microvms \
  --image-identifier claude-worker \
  --query 'items[].[microvmId,state,startedAt]' --output table
```
