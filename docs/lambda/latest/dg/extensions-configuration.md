# Configuring Lambda extensions

## Configuring extensions (.zip file archive)

You can add an extension to your function as a [Lambda layer](chapter-layers.md "chapter-layers.md"). Using
layers enables you to share extensions across your organization or to the entire community of Lambda developers.
You can add one or more extensions to a layer. You can register up to 10 extensions for a function.

You add the extension to your function using the same method as you would for any layer. For more information,
see [Managing Lambda dependencies with layers](chapter-layers.md "chapter-layers.md").

###### Add an extension to your function (console)

1. Open the [Functions page](https://console.aws.amazon.com/lambda/home#/functions "https://console.aws.amazon.com/lambda/home#/functions") of the Lambda console.
2. Choose a function.
3. Choose the **Code** tab if it is not already selected.
4. Under **Layers**, choose **Edit**.
5. For **Choose a layer**, choose **Specify an ARN**.
6. For **Specify an ARN**, enter the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an extension
   layer.
7. Choose **Add**.

## Using extensions in container images

You can add extensions to your [container image](images-create.md "images-create.md"). The ENTRYPOINT container
image setting specifies the main process for the function. Configure the ENTRYPOINT setting in the Dockerfile, or
as an override in the function configuration.

You can run multiple processes within a container. Lambda manages the lifecycle of the main process and any
additional processes. Lambda uses the [Extensions API](runtimes-extensions-api.md "runtimes-extensions-api.md") to manage the
extension lifecycle.

### Example: Adding an external extension

An external extension runs in a separate process from the Lambda function. Lambda starts a process for each
extension in the `/opt/extensions/` directory. Lambda uses the Extensions API to manage the extension
lifecycle. After the function has run to completion, Lambda sends a `Shutdown` event to each external
extension.

###### Example of adding an external extension to a Python base image

```
FROM public.ecr.aws/lambda/python:3.11

# Copy and install the app
COPY /app /app
WORKDIR /app
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

# Add an extension from the local directory into /opt/extensions
ADD my-extension.zip /opt/extensions
CMD python ./my-function.py
```
