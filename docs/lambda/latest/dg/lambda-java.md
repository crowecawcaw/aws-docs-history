# Building Lambda functions with Java

You can run Java code in AWS Lambda. Lambda provides [runtimes](lambda-runtimes.md "lambda-runtimes.md") for
Java that run your code to process events. Your code runs in an Amazon Linux environment that includes AWS credentials from an AWS Identity and Access Management
(IAM) role that you manage.

Lambda supports the following Java runtimes.

| Name    | Identifier  | Operating system  | Deprecation date | Block function create | Block function update |
| ------- | ----------- | ----------------- | ---------------- | --------------------- | --------------------- |
| Java 21 | `java21`    | Amazon Linux 2023 | Jun 30, 2029     | Jul 31, 2029          | Aug 31, 2029          |
| Java 17 | `java17`    | Amazon Linux 2    | Jun 30, 2026     | Jul 31, 2026          | Aug 31, 2026          |
| Java 11 | `java11`    | Amazon Linux 2    | Jun 30, 2026     | Jul 31, 2026          | Aug 31, 2026          |
| Java 8  | `java8.al2` | Amazon Linux 2    | Jun 30, 2026     | Jul 31, 2026          | Aug 31, 2026          |

AWS provides the following libraries for Java functions. These libraries are available through [Maven
Central Repository](https://search.maven.org/search?q=g:com.amazonaws "https://search.maven.org/search?q=g:com.amazonaws").

- [com.amazonaws:aws-lambda-java-core](https://github.com/aws/aws-lambda-java-libs/tree/master/aws-lambda-java-core "https://github.com/aws/aws-lambda-java-libs/tree/master/aws-lambda-java-core")
  (required) – Defines handler method interfaces and the context object that the runtime passes to the
  handler. If you define your own input types, this is the only library that you need.
- [com.amazonaws:aws-lambda-java-events](https://github.com/aws/aws-lambda-java-libs/tree/master/aws-lambda-java-events "https://github.com/aws/aws-lambda-java-libs/tree/master/aws-lambda-java-events") – Input types for events from services that invoke Lambda
  functions.
- [com.amazonaws:aws-lambda-java-log4j2](https://github.com/aws/aws-lambda-java-libs/tree/master/aws-lambda-java-log4j2 "https://github.com/aws/aws-lambda-java-libs/tree/master/aws-lambda-java-log4j2") – An appender library for Apache Log4j 2 that you can use
  to add the request ID for the current invocation to your [function
  logs](java-logging.md "java-logging.md").
- [AWS SDK for Java 2.0](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-java-v2 "https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-java-v2") – The official AWS SDK for the Java programming language.
  Add these libraries to your build definition as follows:

Gradle

```
dependencies {
    `implementation 'com.amazonaws:aws-lambda-java-core:1.2.2'
 implementation 'com.amazonaws:aws-lambda-java-events:3.11.1'
 runtimeOnly 'com.amazonaws:aws-lambda-java-log4j2:1.5.1'`
}
```

Maven

```
  <dependencies>
    <dependency>
      <groupId>com.amazonaws</groupId>
      <artifactId>aws-lambda-java-core</artifactId>
      <version>1.2.2</version>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
      <groupId>com.amazonaws</groupId>
      <artifactId>aws-lambda-java-events</artifactId>
      <version>3.11.1</version>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
      <groupId>com.amazonaws</groupId>
      <artifactId>aws-lambda-java-log4j2</artifactId>
      <version>1.5.1</version>
    </dependency>
  </dependencies>
```

###### Important

Don't use private components of the JDK API, such as private fields, methods, or classes. Non-public API components can change or be removed in any update, causing your application to break.

###### To create a Java function

1. Open the [Lambda console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/lambda "https://console.aws.amazon.com/lambda").
2. Choose **Create function**.
3. Configure the following settings:
   - **Function name**: Enter a name for the function.
   - **Runtime**: Choose **Java 21**.

4. Choose **Create function**.
   The console creates a Lambda function with a handler class named `Hello`.
   Since Java is a compiled language, you can't view or edit the source code in the Lambda console, but you can modify its
   configuration, invoke it, and configure triggers.

###### Note

To get started with application development in your local environment, deploy one of the [sample applications](java-samples.md "java-samples.md") available in this guide's GitHub repository.

The `Hello` class has a function named `handleRequest` that takes an event object and
a context object. This is the [handler function](java-handler.md "java-handler.md") that Lambda calls when the
function is invoked. The Java function runtime gets invocation events from Lambda and passes them to the
handler. In the function configuration, the handler value is `example.Hello::handleRequest`.

To update the function's code, you create a deployment
package, which is a .zip file archive that contains your function code. As your function development progresses, you will
want to store your function code in source control, add libraries, and automate deployments. Start by [creating a deployment package](java-package.md "java-package.md") and updating your code at the command
line.

The function runtime passes a context object to the handler, in addition to the invocation event. The [context object](java-context.md "java-context.md") contains additional information about the invocation, the
function, and the execution environment. More information is available from environment variables.

Your Lambda function comes with a CloudWatch Logs log group. The function runtime sends details about each invocation to
CloudWatch Logs. It relays any [logs that your function outputs](java-logging.md "java-logging.md") during invocation. If
your function returns an error, Lambda formats the error and returns it to the
invoker.
