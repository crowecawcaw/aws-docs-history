# Logging AWS Service Catalog API Calls with AWS CloudTrail

CloudTrail is enabled on your AWS account when you create the account. When activity occurs in
AWS Service Catalog, that activity is recorded in a CloudTrail event along with other AWS service
events in **Event history**. You can view, search, and download recent events
in your AWS account. For more information, see [Viewing Events with CloudTrail Event History.](../../../awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/view-cloudtrail-events.md "../../../awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/view-cloudtrail-events.md")

For an ongoing record of events in your AWS account, including events for AWS Service Catalog,
create a trail. A _trail_ enables CloudTrail to deliver log files to an Amazon S3 bucket.
By default, when you create a trail in the console, the trail applies to all AWS Regions. The trail logs events
from all Regions in the AWS partition and delivers the log files to the Amazon S3 bucket that you
specify. Additionally, you can configure other AWS services to further analyze and act upon
the event data collected in CloudTrail logs. For more information, see the following:

  All AWS Service Catalog actions are logged by CloudTrail and are documented in the
  [Service Catalog Developer Guide](../dg.md "../dg.md"). For example, calls to the
  `SearchProducts`, `ListLaunchPaths` and `ListLaunchPaths` actions generate
  entries in the CloudTrail log files.

Every event or log entry contains information about who generated the
request. The identity information helps you determine whether:

- Root or AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) user credentials made the
  request.
- Temporary security credentials for a role or federated user made
  the request.
- Another AWS service made the request.
  For more information, see the [CloudTrail userIdentity
  Element](../../../awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/cloudtrail-event-reference-user-identity.md "../../../awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/cloudtrail-event-reference-user-identity.md").
