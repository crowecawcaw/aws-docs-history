# Scale cluster compute with Karpenter and Cluster Autoscaler

Autoscaling is a function that automatically scales your resources out and in to meet changing demands. This is a major Kubernetes function that would otherwise require extensive human resources to perform manually.

## EKS Auto Mode

Amazon EKS Auto Mode automatically scales cluster compute resources. If a pod can’t fit onto existing nodes, EKS Auto Mode creates a new one. EKS Auto Mode also consolidates workloads and deletes nodes. EKS Auto Mode builds upon Karpenter.

For more information, see:

- [Automate cluster infrastructure with EKS Auto Mode](automode.md "automode.md")
- [Create a Node Pool for EKS Auto Mode](create-node-pool.md "create-node-pool.md")
- [Deploy a sample inflate workload to an Amazon EKS Auto Mode cluster](automode-workload.md "automode-workload.md")

## Additional Solutions

Amazon EKS supports two additional autoscaling products:

**Karpenter**

Karpenter is a flexible, high-performance Kubernetes cluster autoscaler that helps improve application availability and cluster efficiency. Karpenter launches right-sized compute resources (for example, Amazon EC2 instances) in response to changing application load in under a minute. Through integrating Kubernetes with AWS, Karpenter can provision just-in-time compute resources that precisely meet the requirements of your workload. Karpenter automatically provisions new compute resources based on the specific requirements of cluster workloads. These include compute, storage, acceleration, and scheduling requirements. Amazon EKS supports clusters using Karpenter, although Karpenter works with any conformant Kubernetes cluster. For more information, see the [Karpenter](https://karpenter.sh/docs/ "https://karpenter.sh/docs/") documentation.

###### Important

Karpenter is open-source software which AWS customers are responsible for installing, configuring, and managing in their Kubernetes clusters. AWS provides technical support when Karpenter is run unmodified using a compatible version in Amazon EKS clusters. It is essential that customers maintain the availability and security of the Karpenter controller as well as appropriate testing procedures when upgrading it or the Kubernetes cluster in which it’s running, just like any other customer-managed software. There is no AWS Service Level Agreement (SLA) for Karpenter and customers are responsible for ensuring that the EC2 instances launched by Karpenter meet their business requirements.

**Cluster Autoscaler**

The Kubernetes Cluster Autoscaler automatically adjusts the number of nodes in your cluster when pods fail or are rescheduled onto other nodes. The Cluster Autoscaler uses Auto Scaling groups. For more information, see [Cluster Autoscaler on AWS](https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/blob/master/cluster-autoscaler/cloudprovider/aws/README.md "https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/blob/master/cluster-autoscaler/cloudprovider/aws/README.md").
