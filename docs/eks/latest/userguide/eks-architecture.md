# Amazon EKS architecture

Amazon EKS aligns with the general cluster architecture of Kubernetes. For more information, see [Kubernetes Components](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/components/ "https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/components/") in the Kubernetes documentation. The following sections summarize some extra architecture details for Amazon EKS.

## Control plane

Amazon EKS ensures every cluster has its own unique Kubernetes control plane. This design keeps each cluster’s infrastructure separate, with no overlaps between clusters or AWS accounts. The setup includes:

**Distributed components**

The control plane positions at least two API server instances and three [etcd](https://etcd.io/ "https://etcd.io/") instances across three AWS Availability Zones within an AWS Region.

**Optimal performance**

Amazon EKS actively monitors and adjusts control plane instances to maintain peak performance.

**Resilience**

If a control plane instance falters, Amazon EKS quickly replaces it, using a different Availability Zone if needed.

**Consistent uptime**

By running clusters across multiple Availability Zones, a reliable [API server endpoint availability Service Level Agreement (SLA)](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/sla "https://aws.amazon.com/eks/sla") is achieved.

Amazon EKS uses Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) to limit traffic between control plane components within a single cluster. Cluster components can’t view or receive communication from other clusters or AWS accounts, except when authorized by Kubernetes role-based access control (RBAC) policies.

## Compute

In addition to the control plane, an Amazon EKS cluster has a set of worker machines called nodes. Selecting the appropriate Amazon EKS cluster node type is crucial for meeting your specific requirements and optimizing resource utilization. Amazon EKS offers the following primary node types:

**EKS Auto Mode**

[EKS Auto Mode](automode.md "automode.md") extends AWS management beyond the control plane to include the data plane, automating cluster infrastructure management. It integrates core Kubernetes capabilities as built-in components, including compute autoscaling, networking, load balancing, DNS, storage, and GPU support. EKS Auto Mode dynamically manages nodes based on workload demands, using immutable AMIs with enhanced security features. It automates updates and upgrades while respecting Pod Disruption Budgets, and includes managed components that would otherwise require add-on management. This option is ideal for users who want to leverage AWS expertise for day-to-day operations, minimize operational overhead, and focus on application development rather than infrastructure management.

**AWS Fargate**

[Fargate](fargate.md "fargate.md") is a serverless compute engine for containers that eliminates the need to manage the underlying instances. With Fargate, you specify your application’s resource needs, and AWS automatically provisions, scales, and maintains the infrastructure. This option is ideal for users who prioritize ease-of-use and want to concentrate on application development and deployment rather than managing infrastructure.

**Karpenter**

[Karpenter](https://karpenter.sh/ "https://karpenter.sh/") is a flexible, high-performance Kubernetes cluster autoscaler that helps improve application availability and cluster efficiency. Karpenter launches right-sized compute resources in response to changing application load. This option can provision just-in-time compute resources that meet the requirements of your workload.

**Managed node groups**

[Managed node groups](managed-node-groups.md "managed-node-groups.md") are a blend of automation and customization for managing a collection of Amazon EC2 instances within an Amazon EKS cluster. AWS takes care of tasks like patching, updating, and scaling nodes, easing operational aspects. In parallel, custom `kubelet` arguments are supported, opening up possibilities for advanced CPU and memory management policies. Moreover, they enhance security via AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles for service accounts, while curbing the need for separate permissions per cluster.

**Self-managed nodes**

[Self-managed nodes](worker.md "worker.md") offer full control over your Amazon EC2 instances within an Amazon EKS cluster. You are in charge of managing, scaling, and maintaining the nodes, giving you total control over the underlying infrastructure. This option is suitable for users who need granular control and customization of their nodes and are ready to invest time in managing and maintaining their infrastructure.

**Amazon EKS Hybrid Nodes**

With [Amazon EKS Hybrid Nodes](hybrid-nodes-overview.md "hybrid-nodes-overview.md"), you can use your on-premises and edge infrastructure as nodes in Amazon EKS clusters. Amazon EKS Hybrid Nodes unifies Kubernetes management across environments and offloads Kubernetes control plane management to AWS for your on-premises and edge applications.

## EKS Capabilities

Amazon EKS provides fully managed cluster capabilities, installing and managing Kubernetes APIs (with Kubernetes Custom Resource Definitions) in your cluster while operating controllers and other components in AWS-owned infrastructure, separate from your cluster.
EKS provides automated patching, scaling, and monitoring of these capabilities, fully managing their lifecycle to reduce the burden of operating in-cluster services for workload orchestration, AWS resource management, and more.

EKS provides the following capability types:

**AWS Controllers for Kubernetes (ACK)**

[AWS Controllers for Kubernetes (ACK)](ack.md "ack.md") enables you to manage AWS resources using Kubernetes APIs, allowing you to define S3 buckets, RDS databases, IAM roles, and other AWS resources as Kubernetes custom resources.
You can manage AWS resources alongside your Kubernetes workloads using the same tools and workflows, with support for 50+ AWS services including S3, RDS, DynamoDB, and Lambda.

**Argo CD**

[Argo CD](argocd.md "argocd.md") implements GitOps-based continuous deployment for your application workloads, AWS resources, and cluster configuration, using Git repositories as the source of truth.
Argo CD automatically syncs your clusters with your Git repositories and detects drift, continuously reconciling to ensure your deployed applications and resources match your desired state in version control.
You can use Argo CD to manage applications on a given cluster, or deploy and manage applications across multiple clusters from a single Argo CD resource, with automated deployment from Git repositories whenever changes are committed.

**kro (Kube Resource Orchestrator)**

[kro (Kube Resource Orchestrator)](kro.md "kro.md") enables you to create custom Kubernetes APIs that compose multiple resources into higher-level abstractions, allowing platform teams to define reusable patterns for common resource combinations.
This enables platform teams to provide self-service capabilities with appropriate guardrails, allowing developers to provision complex infrastructure using simple, purpose-built APIs while maintaining organizational standards and best practices.
