# Create a GPU NodePool for AI/ML inference
<a name="ml-inference-gpu-nodepool"></a>

**Tip**  
 [Register](https://events.eksworkshop.com/workshops/genai/) for upcoming Amazon EKS AI/ML workshops.

This section defines an EKS Auto Mode or Karpenter NodePool in your Amazon EKS cluster that dynamically provisions Amazon EC2 G-family GPU instances, using Spot capacity with On-Demand fallback. You can optionally add reserved capacity through an Amazon EC2 On-Demand Capacity Reservation (ODCR). The GPU instances are automatically created in EKS Auto Mode or Karpenter as workloads are run on the cluster.

This section builds on the cluster you created in the [Set up Amazon EKS cluster for AI/ML workloads](ml-cluster-setup.md) section. Complete that section first, then choose the same path (EKS Auto Mode or self-managed Karpenter) that you used to create your cluster.
+ For step-by-step instructions using the AWS CLI, see [Create a GPU NodePool using CLIs](ml-inference-gpu-nodepool-cli.md).
+ For step-by-step instructions using Terraform, see [Create a GPU NodePool using Terraform](ml-inference-gpu-nodepool-tf.md).

After your GPU NodePool is ready, continue to [Load & Serve Models on Amazon EKS](ml-inference-load-serve-model.md) to deploy a large language model and serve inference requests.
