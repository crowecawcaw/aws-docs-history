# Using service-linked roles for

EventBridge

Amazon EventBridge uses AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) [service-linked roles](../../../IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_terms-and-concepts.md#iam-term-service-linked-role "../../../IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_terms-and-concepts.md#iam-term-service-linked-role"). A service-linked role is a unique type of IAM role that is
linked directly to EventBridge. Service-linked roles are predefined by EventBridge and
include all the permissions that the service requires to call other AWS services on your
behalf.

A service-linked role makes setting up EventBridge easier because you don’t have to
manually add the necessary permissions. EventBridge defines the permissions of its
service-linked roles, and unless defined otherwise, only EventBridge can assume its roles.
The defined permissions include the trust policy and the permissions policy, and that
permissions policy cannot be attached to any other IAM entity.

You can delete a service-linked role only after first deleting their related resources.
This protects your EventBridge resources because you can't inadvertently remove permission
to access the resources.

For information about other services that support service-linked roles, see [AWS services
that work with IAM](../../../IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_aws-services-that-work-with-iam.md "../../../IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_aws-services-that-work-with-iam.md") and look for the services that have **Yes** in the **Service-linked roles** column. Choose a
**Yes** with a link to view the service-linked role
documentation for that service.
