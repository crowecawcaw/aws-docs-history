# Using dead-letter queues to process undelivered events in EventBridge

To avoid losing events after they fail to be delivered to a
target, you can configure a dead-letter queue (DLQ) and send all failed events to it for
processing later.

EventBridge DLQs are standard Amazon SQS queues that EventBridge uses to store events that couldn't
successfully be delivered to a target. When you create a rule and add a target, you can choose
whether or not to use a DLQ. When you configure a DLQ, you can retain any events that weren't
successfully delivered. Then you can resolve the issue that resulted in the failed event
delivery and process the events at a later time.

When you configure a DLQ for a target of a rule, EventBridge sends the events with failed
invocations to the Amazon SQS queue selected.

Event errors are handled in different ways. Some events are dropped or sent to a DLQ without
any retry attempts. For example, for errors that result from missing permissions to a target, a target resource that no longer exists, or a target that cannot be found due to an invalid address or DNS lookup failure, no retry attempts will happen until action is taken to resolve the underlying issue.
EventBridge sends these events directly to the target DLQ, if you have specified one.

When an event delivery fails, EventBridge publishes an event to Amazon CloudWatch metrics indicating that a
target `invocation` failed. If you use a DLQ, additional metrics are sent to CloudWatch
including `InvocationsSentToDLQ` and `InvocationsFailedToBeSentToDLQ`.

You can also specify DLQs for event buses, if you use AWS KMS customer managed keys to encrypt events at rest. For more information, see [Using dead-letter queues to capture encrypted
event errors in EventBridge](eb-encryption-event-bus-dlq.md "eb-encryption-event-bus-dlq.md").

Each message in your DLQ will include the following custom attributes:

- `RULE_ARN`
- `TARGET_ARN`
- `ERROR_CODE`

The following is a sample of the error codes a DLQ can return:

    + `CONNECTION_FAILURE`
    + `CROSS_ACCOUNT_INGESTION_FAILED`
    + `CROSS_REGION_INGESTION_FAILED`
    + `ERROR_FROM_TARGET`
    + `EVENTS_IN_BATCH_REQUEST_REJECTED`
    + `EVENTS_IN_BATCH_REQUEST_REJECTED`
    + `FAILED_TO_ASSUME_ROLE`
    + `INTERNAL_ERROR`
    + `INVALID_JSON`
    + `INVALID_PARAMETER`
    + `NO_PERMISSIONS`
    + `NO_RESOURCE`
    + `RESOURCE_ALREADY_EXISTS`
    + `RESOURCE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED`
    + `RESOURCE_MODIFICATION_COLLISION`
    + `SDK_CLIENT_ERROR`
    + `THIRD_ACCOUNT_HOP_DETECTED`
    + `THIRD_REGION_HOP_DETECTED`
    + `THROTTLING`
    + `TIMEOUT`
    + `TRANSIENT_ASSUME_ROLE`
    + `UNKNOWN`

- `ERROR_MESSAGE`
- `EXHAUSTED_RETRY_CONDITION`

The following conditions can be returned:

    + `MaximumRetryAttempts`
    + `MaximumEventAgeInSeconds`

- `RETRY_ATTEMPTS`

## Considerations for using a dead-letter queue

Consider the following when configuring a DLQ for EventBridge.

- Only [standard queues](../../../AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/standard-queues.md "../../../AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/standard-queues.md") are supported. You can't use a FIFO queue for
  a DLQ in EventBridge.
- EventBridge includes event metadata and message attributes in the message,
  including: the Error Code, Error Message, the Exhausted Retry Condition,
  Rule ARN, Retry Attempts, and the Target ARN. You can use these values to
  identify an event and the cause of the failure.
- Permissions for DLQs in the same account:
  - If you add a target to a rule using the console, and you choose an
    Amazon SQS queue in the same account, a [resource-based policy](eb-use-resource-based.md "eb-use-resource-based.md") that grants
    EventBridge access to the queue is attached to the queue for you.
  - If you use the `PutTargets` operation of the EventBridge API
    to add or update a target for a rule, and you choose an Amazon SQS queue
    in the same account, you must manually grant permissions to the
    queue selected. To learn more, see [Granting permissions to the dead-letter queue](#eb-dlq-perms "#eb-dlq-perms").

- Permissions for using Amazon SQS queues from a different AWS account.
  - If you create a rule from the console, queues from other accounts
    aren't displayed for you to select. You must provide the ARN for
    the queue in the other account, and then manually attach a
    resource-based policy to grant permission to the queue. To learn
    more, see [Granting permissions to the dead-letter queue](#eb-dlq-perms "#eb-dlq-perms").
  - If you create a rule using the API, you must manually attach a
    resource-based policy to the SQS queues in another account that is

  used as the dead-letter queue. To learn more, see [Granting permissions to the dead-letter queue](#eb-dlq-perms "#eb-dlq-perms").

- The Amazon SQS queue you use must be in the same Region in which you create the
  rule.

## Granting permissions to the dead-letter queue

To successfully deliver events to the queue, EventBridge must have permission to do so. When
you specify a DLQ using the EventBridge console, the permissions are automatically added. This
includes:

- When you configure a DLQ for a target of a rule.
- When you configure a DLQ for an event bus where you've specified that EventBridge use an
  AWS KMS
  customer managed key to encrypt events at rest.

For more information, see [Using dead-letter queues to capture encrypted
event errors in EventBridge](eb-encryption-event-bus-dlq.md "eb-encryption-event-bus-dlq.md").

If you specify a DLQ using the API, or use a queue that is in a different AWS
account, you must manually create a resource-based policy that grants the required
permissions and then attach it to the queue.

**Target dead-letter queue permissions example**

The following resource-based policy demonstrates how to grant the required
permissions for EventBridge to send event messages to an Amazon SQS queue. The policy example
grants the EventBridge service permissions to use the `SendMessage` operation to
send messages to a queue named "MyEventDLQ". The queue must be in the us-west-2
Region in AWS account 123456789012. The `Condition` statement allows only
requests that come from a rule named "MyTestRule" that is created in the us-west-2
Region in the AWS account 123456789012.

```
{
  "Sid": "Dead-letter queue permissions",
  "Effect": "Allow",
  "Principal": {
     "Service": "events.amazonaws.com"
  },
  "Action": "sqs:SendMessage",
  "Resource": "arn:aws:sqs:`us-west-2:``123456789012`:`MyEventDLQ`",
  "Condition": {
    "ArnEquals": {
      "aws:SourceArn": "arn:aws:events:`us-west-2`:`123456789012`:rule/`MyTestRule`"
    }
  }
}
```

**Event bus dead-letter queue permissions example**

The following resource-based policy demonstrates how to grant the required permissions
when specifying a DLQ for an event bus. In this case, `aws:SourceArn` specifies
the ARN of the event bus sending the events to the DLQ. Here again in this example, the
queue must be in the same Region as the event bus.

```
{
  "Sid": "Dead-letter queue permissions",
  "Effect": "Allow",
  "Principal": {
     "Service": "events.amazonaws.com"
  },
  "Action": "sqs:SendMessage",
  "Resource": "arn:aws:sqs:`region`:`account-id`:`queue-name`",
  "Condition": {
    "ArnEquals": {
      "aws:SourceArn": "arn:aws:events:`region`:`account-id`:event-bus/`event-bus-arn`"
    }
  }
}
```

To attach the policy to the queue, use the Amazon SQS console, open the queue, then choose
the **Access policy** and edit the policy. You can also use the AWS CLI. To
learn more, see [Amazon SQS permissions](eb-use-resource-based.md#eb-sqs-permissions "eb-use-resource-based.md#eb-sqs-permissions").

## How to resend events from a dead-letter queue

You can move messages out of a DLQ in two ways:

- Avoid writing Amazon SQS consumer logic – Set your DLQ as an
  event source to the Lambda function to drain your DLQ.
- Write Amazon SQS consumer logic – Use the Amazon SQS API, AWS SDK, or AWS CLI
  to write custom consumer logic for polling, processing, and deleting the
  messages in the DLQ.
