# Using visual field controls

You can edit the fields used by a visual with user interface (UI) controls.

You can use these controls as follows:

- Create a visual and assign fields to different elements on it by selecting
  fields in the **Fields list** pane, or dragging fields to
  field wells or drop targets.
- Change the field associated with a visual element by dragging a field to a
  drop target or field well, or selecting a different field in a field well or
  on-visual editor.
- Change field aggregation or date granularity by using the field wells or
  the on-visual editors.
  The field wells, on-visual editors, and drop targets available on a specific
  visual depends on the visual type selected.

## Dragging fields to drop targets or field

wells

When you drag a field to either a drop target or field well, Amazon Quick
provides you with information about whether the target element expects a measure
or a dimension. Amazon Quick also provides you with information about whether
that element is available for field assignment.

For example, when you drag a measure to the value drop target on a new
single-measure line chart, you see the drop target color-coded green. That green
color coding indicates that the drop target expects a measure. The drag label
indicates that the target is available to add a field.

When you drag a dimension to the x-axis or color drop target on a new line
chart, you see a label color-coded blue. That blue color coding indicates that
the drop target expects a dimension. The drag label indicates that the target is
available to add a field.

You can also drag a measure or dimension to a drop target on a line chart
where the element is already associated with a field. In this case, the drag
label indicates that you are replacing the field currently associated with the
drop target.
