# Copy and migrate Quick Sight topics

within and between AWS accounts

You can migrate your Quick Sight topics from one account to another with the
Quick Sight command line interface (CLI). Instead of manually replicating the same
topic across multiple dashboards, namespaces, or accounts, you can use the
Quick Sight CLI to reuse the same topic repeatedly. This capability saves
Quick Sight authors time and creates a standardized topic experience for dashboard
readers across multiple dashboards.

To migrate topics with the Quick Sight CLI, use the following procedure

###### To migrate a topic to another account

1. First, identify the topic that you want to migrate. You can view a list of
   every topic in your Quick account with a
   `list-topics` API command.

```
aws quicksight list-topics --aws-account-id `AWSACCOUNTID`
```

2. After you have a list of topics, locate the topic that you want to migrate
   and make a `describe-topic` call to receive a JSON structure of
   the topic's configuration.

```
aws quicksight describe-topic
    --aws-account-id `AWSACCOUNTID`
    --topic-id `TOPICID`
```

Following is an example of a `describe-topic` API
response.

```
{
    "Status": 200,
    "TopicId": "TopicExample",
    "Arn": "string",
    "Topic": [
        {
            "Name": "{}",
            "DataSets": [
            {
            "DataSetArn": "{}",
            "DataSetName": "{}",
            "DataSetDescription": "{}",
            "DataAggregation": "{}",
            "Filters": [],
            "Columns": [],
            "CalculatedFields": [],
            "NamedEntities": []
            }
            ]
        }
    ],
    "RequestId": "requestId"
    }
```

3. Use the JSON response to create a skeleton file that you can input into a
   new `create-topic` call in your other Quick account.
   Before you make an API call with your skeleton file, make sure to change the
   AWS account ID and dataset ID in the skeleton file to match the
   AWS account ID and dataset ID that you are adding the new topic to. For
   more information about CLI skeleton files, see [Using CLI
   skeleton files](../../../quicksight/latest/developerguide/cli-skeletons.md "../../../quicksight/latest/developerguide/cli-skeletons.md") in the _Amazon Quick Sight Developer
   Guide_.

```
aws quicksight create-topic --aws-account-id `AWSACCOUNTID` \
--cli-input-json `file://./create-topic-cli-input.json`
```

After you make a `create-topic` call to the Quick Sight API, the new
topic appears in your account. To confirm that the new topic exists, make a
`list-topics` call to the Quick Sight API. If the source topic that
was duplicated contains verified answers, the answers are not migrated to the new
topic. To see a list of all verified answers that are configured to the original
topic, use a `describe-topic` API call.
