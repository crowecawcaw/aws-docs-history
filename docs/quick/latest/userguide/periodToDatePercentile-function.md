# periodToDatePercentile

The `periodToDatePercentile` function calculates the percentile based on
the actual numbers in measure for a given time granularity (for instance, a quarter) up
to a point in time, relative to that period. It uses the grouping and sorting that are
applied in the field wells.

To return the nearest percentile value that is present in your dataset, use
`periodToDatePercentile`. To return an exact percentile value that might
not be present in your dataset, use `periodToDatePercentileCont`
instead.

## Syntax

```
periodToDatePercentile(*measure,
 percentile,
 dateTime,
 period,
 endDate (optional)*)
```

## Arguments

_measure_

The argument must be a field. Null values are omitted from the
results. Literal values don't work.

_percentile_

The percentile value can be any numeric constant 0-100. A percentile
of 50 computes the median value of the measure.

_dateTime_

The Date dimension over which you're computing PeriodToDate
aggregations.

_period_

The time period across which you're computing the computation.
Granularity of `YEAR` means `YearToDate`
computation, `Quarter` means `QuarterToDate`, and
so on. Valid granularities include `YEAR`,
`QUARTER`, `MONTH`, `WEEK`,
`DAY`, `HOUR`, `MINUTE`, and
`SECONDS`.

_endDate_

(Optional) The date dimension that you're ending computing
periodToDate aggregations. It defaults to `now()` if
omitted.

## Example

The following example calculates the week-to-date, 90th percentile of fare amount
per payment type for the week of 06-30-21. For simplicity in the example, we
filtered out only a single payment. 06-30-21 is Wednesday. Quick begins
the week on Sundays. In our example. that is 06-27-21.

```
periodToDatePercentile(fare_amount, 90, pickupDatetime, WEEK, parseDate("06-30-2021", "MM-dd-yyyy"))
```
