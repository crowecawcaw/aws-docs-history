## Arguments
<a name="substring-function-arguments"></a>

 *expression*   
An expression can be the name of a field that uses the string data type like **address1**, a literal value like **'Unknown'**, or another function like `substring(field_name,1,5)`.

 *start*   
The character location to start from. *start* is inclusive, so the character at the starting position is the first character in the returned value. The minimum value for *start* is 1. 

 *length*   
The number of additional characters to include after *start*. *length* is inclusive of *start*, so the last character returned is (*length* - 1) after the starting character.
