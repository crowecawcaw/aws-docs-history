Q&A

## Converting to the

Generative Q&A experience

If you have existing topics, you can easily convert these to leverage our new
generative capabilities. Navigate to a topic, and then choose
**Convert** next to the topic name. You will then be prompted
to **Duplicate & Convert Topic** in a dialog box. We duplicate
your topic for you so that the conversion to our beta experience does not impact
your end users. Once you are satisfied with topic performance in the new experience,
you can unshare the original topic and share the new one.

## Named entities

Named entities are one of the most important components of topic curation. The
information contained in named entities — specifically, the ordering of
fields and their ranking — is what makes it possible to present contextual,
multi-visual answers in response to even vague questions. Authors can find named
entities by navigating to a topic, choosing the **Data** tab, and
then choosing the **Named Entities**. From here, authors can
preview or edit existing named entities, and create new ones.

Authors can configure the following facets of named entities:

1. **Fields**: Choose a dataset, and then choose
   which fields from that dataset to include. This defines the scope of data
   that will be considered when using this named entity to answer enduser
   questions.
2. **Field Rank and Presentation**: The relative
   rank of the dimensions and measures in a named entity determines how those
   fields are used when generating contextual, multi-visual answers. Note in
   the following demo that adjusting the relative rank of
   **Profit** so that it is higher than
   **Sales** leads to different data being displayed. By
   default, the order of fields in the table visual is the same as the field
   rank. However, you can control these two individually by turning off
   **Sync table view with field ranking**.
3. **Show / Hide in Presentation**: Fields that
   are included in named entities can simultaneously be hidden from the tabular
   presentation of the named entity, while still providing additional context
   in other components of the answer.

## Measure

aggregations

Authors have fine-grained control over aggregated measures in topics. Across
Quick Sight, measures are defaulted to `SUM`,unless they have custom
aggregations defined in a calculated expression. To change this, navigate to the
measure in the list of data fields, and specify a different default aggregation. You
can also disallow aggregations, which will prevent them from being applied even if a
user specifically asks for them. Lastly, you can specify that a measure is
non-additive. This is useful for pre-computed metrics, such as percentages, which
should not be re-combined in any way. Doing so will force `MEDIAN` or
`AVG` depending on your use case.
