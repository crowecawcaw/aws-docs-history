Teams extension usage guidelines

As a user, you are responsible for keeping company information safe. The
following guidance helps you use Amazon Quick apps securely while maintaining
data privacy and compliance.

### Conversation retention policy

and accuracy

Amazon Quick automatically deletes conversations after 30 days of
inactivity. Teams conversation retention follows your company's specific
history rules. Teams retention periods may exceed Amazon Quick's 30-day
limit. To start fresh, begin a new conversation by using the
`/new_conv` command

Users can review past conversations in Teams or all
conversations from all channels (Teams, browser extensions,
etc.) in your Amazon Quick chat instance.

###### Note

Deleting conversations or messages in Teams does not
remove them from Amazon Quick. To manage your conversation history, use
the Amazon Quick chat instance.

### Security

considerations

When Amazon Quick is invoked by a user in a public Teams
channel, it generates responses based on the invoking user's permissions,
which may include content that other channel members aren't authorized to
access. To prevent unintended exposure of sensitive information, carefully
evaluate the use of Amazon Quick in public channels.

**File upload behavior in Amazon Quick Teams
Extension:**

- Responses will be limited to the uploaded file content.
- General knowledge access depends on admin settings.
- Start a new chat to access company knowledge again.

### Data privacy and conversation

behavior

Amazon Quick does not use customer data for service improvement or for
improving its underlying large language models (LLMs). Also, none of the
data you include in your Teams conversations will be indexed
into your company's Amazon Quick instance.

The Amazon Quick Teams app will have access to the same
knowledge available in the corresponding Amazon Quick web experience.

Closing the Amazon Quick bot for Teams side panel will end
the current conversation. Users can review past conversations in
Teams or all conversations from all channels
(Teams, browser extensions, etc.) in your Amazon Quick
web experience. You can access all the history of previous conversations
including, the names of the attachments in those conversations.
