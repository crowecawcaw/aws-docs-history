# Adding text filters

When you add a filter using a text field, you can create the following types of text
filters:

- **Filter list** (Analyses only) – This option creates
  a filter that you can use to select one or more field values to include or
  exclude from all the available values in the field. For more information about
  creating this type of text filter, see [Filtering text field values by a list (analyses
  only)](#text-filter-list "#text-filter-list").
- **Custom filter list** – With this option, you can
  enter one or more field values to filter on, and whether you want to include or
  exclude records that contain those values. The values that you enter must match
  the actual field values exactly for the filter to be applied to a given record.
  For more information about creating this type of text filter, see [Filtering text field values
  by a custom list](#add-text-custom-filter-list-data-prep "#add-text-custom-filter-list-data-prep").
- **Custom filter** – With this option, you enter a
  single value that the field value must match in some way. You can specify that
  the field value must equal, not equal, starts with, ends with, contains, or does
  not contain the value you specify. If you choose an equal comparison, the
  specified value and actual field value must match exactly in order for the
  filter to be applied to a given record. For more information about creating this
  type of text filter, see [Filtering a single text
  field value](#add-text-filter-custom-list-data-prep "#add-text-filter-custom-list-data-prep").
- **Top and bottom filter** (Analyses only) – You can
  use this option to show the top or bottom _n_
  value of one field ranked by the values in another field. For example, you might
  show the top five salespeople based on revenue. You can also use a parameter to
  allow dashboard users to dynamically choose how many top or bottom ranking
  values to show. For more information about creating top and bottom filters, see
  [Filtering a text field by a top or
  bottom value (analyses only)](#add-text-filter-top-and-bottom "#add-text-filter-top-and-bottom").

## Filtering text field values by a list (analyses

only)

In analyses, you can filter a text field by selecting values to include or exclude
from a list of all value in the field.

###### To filter a text field by including and excluding values

1. Create a new filter using a text field. For more information about
   creating filters, see [Adding filters](add-a-filter-data-prep.md "add-a-filter-data-prep.md").
2. In the **Filters** pane, choose the new filter to expand
   it.
3. For **Filter type**, choose **Filter
   list**.
4. For **Filter condition**, choose
   **Include** or **Exclude**.
5. Choose the field values that you want to filter on. To do this, select the
   check box in front of each value.

If there are too many values to choose from, enter a search term into the
box above the checklist and choose **Search**. Search terms
are case-insensitive and wildcards aren't supported. Any field value that
contains the search term is returned. For example, searching on L returns
al, AL, la, and LA.

The values display alphabetically in the control, unless there are more
than 1,000 distinct values. Then the control displays a search box instead.
Each time that you search for the value that you want to use, it starts a
new query. If the results contain more than 1,000 values, you can scroll
through the values with pagination. 6. When finished, choose **Apply**.

## Filtering text field values

by a custom list

You can specify one or more field values to filter on, and whether you want to
include or exclude records that contain those values. The specified value and actual
field value must match exactly for the filter to be applied to a given
record.

###### To filter text field values by a custom list

1. Create a new filter using a text field. For more information about
   creating filters, see [Adding filters](add-a-filter-data-prep.md "add-a-filter-data-prep.md").
2. In the **Filters** pane, choose the new filter to expand
   it.
3. For **Filter type**, choose **Custom filter
   list**.
4. For **Filter condition**, choose
   **Include** or **Exclude**.
5. For **List**, enter a value in the text box. The value
   must match an existing field value exactly.
6. (Optional) To add additional values, enter them in the text box, one per
   line.
7. For **Null options** choose **Exclude
   nulls**, **Include nulls**, or **Nulls
   only**.
8. When finished, choose **Apply**.

## Filtering a single text

field value

With the **Custom filter** filter type, you specify a single
value that the field value must equal or not equal, or must match partially. If you
choose an equal comparison, the specified value and actual field value must match
exactly for the filter to be applied to a given record.

###### To filter a text field by a single value

1. Create a new filter using a text field. For more information about
   creating filters, see [Adding filters](add-a-filter-data-prep.md "add-a-filter-data-prep.md").
2. In the **Filters** pane, choose the new filter to expand
   it.
3. For **Filter type**, choose **Custom
   filter**.
4. For **Filter condition**, choose one of the
   following:
   - **Equals** – When you choose this option,
     the values included or excluded in the field must match the value
     that you enter exactly.
   - **Does not equal** – When you choose this
     option, the values included or excluded in the field must match the
     value that you enter exactly.
   - **Starts with** – When you choose this
     option, the values included or excluded in the field must start with
     the value that you enter.
   - **Ends with** – When you choose this
     option, the values included or excluded in the field must start with
     the value that you enter.
   - **Contains** – When you choose this
     option, the values included or excluded in the field must contain
     the whole value that you enter.
   - **Does not contain** – When you choose
     this option, the values included or excluded in the field must not
     contain any part of the value that you enter.

###### Note

Comparison types are case-sensitive. 5. Do one of the following:

    * For **Value**, enter a literal value.
    * Select **Use parameters** to use an existing
     parameter, and then choose a parameter from the list.


    For parameters to appear in this list, create your parameters
     first. Usually, you create a parameter, add a control for it, and
     then add a filter for it. For more information, see [Parameters in Amazon Quick](parameters-in-quicksight.md "parameters-in-quicksight.md").


    The values display alphabetically in the control, unless there are
     more than 1,000 distinct values. Then the control displays a search
     box instead. Each time that you search for the value that you want
     to use, it starts a new query. If the results contain more than
     1,000 values, you can scroll through the values with
     pagination.

6. For **Null options** choose **Exclude
   nulls**, **Include nulls**, or **Nulls
   only**.
7. When finished, choose **Apply**.

## Filtering a text field by a top or

bottom value (analyses only)

You can use a **Top and bottom filter** to show the top or bottom
_n_ value of one field ranked by the values in
another field. For example, you might show the top five salespeople based on
revenue. You can also use a parameter to allow dashboard users to dynamically choose
how many top or bottom ranking values to show.

###### To create a top and bottom text filter

1.  Create a new filter using a text field. For more information about
    creating filters, see [Adding filters](add-a-filter-data-prep.md "add-a-filter-data-prep.md").
2.  In the **Filters** pane, choose the new filter to expand
    it.
3.  For **Filter type**, choose **Top and bottom
    filter**.
4.  Choose **Top** or **Bottom**.
5.  For **Show top** integer (or **Show
    bottom** integer), do one of the following:
    - Enter the number of top or bottom items to show.
    - To use a parameter for the number of top or bottom items to show,
      select **Use parameters**. Then choose an existing
      integer parameter.

    For example, let's say that you want to show the top three
    salespersons by default. However, you want the dashboard viewer to
    be able to choose whether to show 1–10 top salespersons. In
    this case, take the following actions:

        + Create an integer parameter with a default value.
        + To link the number of displayed items to a parameter
         control, create a control for the integer parameter. Then
         you make the control a slider with a step size of 1, a
         minimum value of 1, and a maximum value of 10.
        + To make the control work, link it to a filter by creating
         a top and bottom filter on `Salesperson` by
         `Weighted Revenue`, enable **Use
         parameters**, and choose your integer
         parameter.

6.  For **By**, choose a field to base the ranking on. If you
    want to show the top five salespeople per revenue, choose the revenue field.
    You can also set the aggregate that you want to perform on the field.
7.  (Optional) Choose **Tie breaker** and then choose another
    field to add one or more aggregations as tie breakers. This is useful, in
    the case of this example, when there are more than five results returned for
    the top five salespeople per revenue. This situation can happen if multiple
    salespeople have the same revenue amount.

To remove a tie breaker, use the delete icon. 8. When finished, choose **Apply**.
