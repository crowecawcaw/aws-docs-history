# Pivot table limitations

The following limitations apply to pivot tables:

- You can create pivot tables with up to 500,000 records.
- You can add any combination of row and column field values that add up to

40. For example, if you have 10 row field values, then you can add up to 30
    column field values.

- You can create pivot table calculations only on nonaggregated values. For
  example, if you create a calculated field that is a sum of a measure, you
  can't also add a pivot table calculation to it.
- If you are sorting by a custom metric, you can't add a table
  calculation until you remove the custom metric sort.
- If you are using a table calculation and then add a custom metric, you
  can't sort by the custom metric.
- Totals and subtotals are blank for table calculations on metrics
  aggregated by distinct count.
