<a name="signing-up"></a>

**Note**  
This section covers signing up for Amazon Quick through the AWS Management Console for organizations that already use AWS. If you want to sign up without an AWS account, see [Signing up at aws.com/quick](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/quicksuite/latest/userguide/standalone-signup.html) for a faster setup process using email or social login. For a comparison of features available with each account type, see [Pricing and availability](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/quicksuite/latest/userguide/what-is.html#pricing).

When you first sign up for Amazon Quick, you get a free trial subscription for twenty-five users for 30 days. During the process of signing up, you may set options for your identity provider.

Before you begin, make sure that you can connect to an existing AWS account. If you don't have an AWS account, see [Complete initial configuration tasks](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/quicksuite/latest/userguide/setting-up). The person who signs up for Quick needs to have the correct AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) permissions. For more information, see [IAM policy examples for Quick](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/quicksight/latest/user/iam-policy-examples.html). 

To test your permissions, you can use the IAM policy simulator; for more information, see [Testing IAM policies with the IAM policy simulator](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_testing-policies.html). Also, check whether your AWS account is part of an organization based on the AWS Organizations service. If so and you sign in as an IAM user, make sure that you didn't inherit any IAM permissions that deny access to the required permissions. For more information on Organizations, see [What is AWS Organizations?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_introduction.html)

**Note**  
Your data is encrypted by default using AWS-managed keys. Admins can adjust settings for custom encryption in the admin portal after signing up.
