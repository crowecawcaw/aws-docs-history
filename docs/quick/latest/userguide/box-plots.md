# Using box plots

_Box plots_, also known as box and whisker plots,
display data pooled from multiple sources into one visual, helping you make data-driven
decisions. Use a box plot to visualize how data is distributed across an axis or over
time, for example flights delayed over a 7-day time period. Typically, a box plot
details information in quarters:

- **Minimum** – The lowest data point
  excluding outliers.
- **Maximum** – The highest data point
  excluding outliers.
- **Median** – The middle value of the
  dataset.
- **First Quartile** – The middle value
  between the smallest number and the median of the dataset. The first quartile
  doesn't include the minimum or the median.
- **Third Quartile** – The middle value
  between the largest number and the median of the dataset. The third quartile
  doesn't include the maximum or the median.
  _Outliers_ are extreme data points that aren't
  included in the calculation of a box plot's key values. Because outliers are calculated
  separately, their data points don't appear immediately after a box plot is created. Box
  plots display up to 10,000 data points. If a dataset contains more than 10,000 data
  points, a warning appears at the upper-right corner of the visual.

Box plots support up to five metrics and one group-by, but don't render if duplicate
metrics are supplied.

Box plots support some calculated fields, but not all. Any calculated field that uses
a window function, for example `avgOver`, results in a SQL error.

Box plot visuals aren't compatible with MySQL 5.3 and earlier.

###### To create a basic box plot visual

1. Sign in to Amazon Quick at [https://quicksight.aws.amazon.com/](https://quicksight.aws.amazon.com/ "https://quicksight.aws.amazon.com/").
2. Open Quick and choose **Analyses** on the
   navigation pane at left.
3. Choose one of the following:
   - To create a new analysis, choose **New analysis** at
     upper right. For more information, see [Starting an analysis in Quick Sight](creating-an-analysis.md "creating-an-analysis.md").
   - To use an existing analysis, choose the analyses that you want to
     edit.

4. Choose **Add**, **Add visual**.
5. At lower left, choose the box plot icon from **Visual
   types**.
6. On the **Fields list** pane, choose the fields that you want
   to use for the appropriate field wells. Box plots require at least one unique
   measure field.
7. (Optional) Add drill-down layers by dragging one or more additional fields to
   the **Group/Color** field well. For more information about
   adding drill-downs, see [Adding drill-downs to visual data in
   Quick Sight](adding-drill-downs.md "adding-drill-downs.md").

Quick](analytics-format-options.md "analytics-format-options.md"). For customization options, see [Formatting in Amazon Quick](formatting-a-visual.md "formatting-a-visual.md").
