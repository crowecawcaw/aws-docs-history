# distinct_count

The `distinct_count` function calculates the number of distinct values in a
dimension or measure, grouped by the chosen dimension or dimensions. For example,
`distinct_count(product type)` returns the total number of unique product
types grouped by the (optional) chosen dimension, without any duplicates. The
`distinct_count(ship date)` function returns the total number of dates
when products were shipped grouped by the (optional) chosen dimension, for example
region.

## Syntax

```
distinct_count(*dimension or measure*, [*group-by level*])
```

## Arguments

_dimension or measure_

The argument must be a measure or a dimension. Null values are omitted
from the results. Literal values don't work. The argument must be a
field.

_group-by level_

(Optional) Specifies the level to group the aggregation by. The level
added can be any dimension or dimensions independent of the dimensions
added to the visual.

The argument must be a dimension field. The group-by level must be
enclosed in square brackets `[ ]`. For more information, see
[Level-aware calculation - aggregate (LAC-A)
functions](../../../quicksight/latest/user/level-aware-calculations-aggregate.md "../../../quicksight/latest/user/level-aware-calculations-aggregate.md").

## Example

The following example calculates the total number of dates when products were
ordered grouped by the (optional) chosen dimension in the visual, for example
region.

```
distinct_count({Order Date})
```

You can also specify at what level to group the computation using one or more
dimensions in the view or in your dataset. This is called a LAC-A function. For more
information about LAC-A functions, see [Level-aware calculation - aggregate (LAC-A)
functions](../../../quicksight/latest/user/level-aware-calculations-aggregate.md "../../../quicksight/latest/user/level-aware-calculations-aggregate.md"). The following example calculates the average sales at the
Country level, but not across other dimensions (Region) in the visual.

```
distinct_count({Order Date}, [Country])
```
