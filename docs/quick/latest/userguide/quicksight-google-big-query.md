# Creating a dataset using Google

BigQuery

###### Note

When Quick Sight uses and transfers information that is received from
Google APIs, it adheres to the [Google API Services User Data Policy](https://developers.google.com/terms/api-services-user-data-policy "https://developers.google.com/terms/api-services-user-data-policy").

Google BigQuery is a fully managed serverless data warehouse that
customers use to manage and analyze their data. Google BigQuery customers
use SQL to query their data without any infrastructure management.

## Creating a data source

connection with Google BigQuery

**Prerequisites**

Before you start, make sure that you have the following. These are all required to
create a data source connection with Google BigQuery:

- **Project ID** – The project ID that
  is associated with your Google account. To find this,
  navigate to the Google Cloud console and choose the name of
  the project that you want to connect to Quick Sight. Copy the project ID
  that appears in the new window and record it for later use.
- **Dataset Region** – The
  Google region that the Google BigQuery
  project exists in. To find the dataset region, navigate
  to the Google BigQuery console and choose
  **Explorer**. Locate and expand the project that you
  want to connect to, then choose the dataset that you want to use. The
  dataset region appears in the pop-up that opens.
- **Google account login
  credentials** – The login credentials for your Google
  account. If you don't have this information, contact your
  Google account administrator.
- **Google BigQuery
  Permissions** – To connect your Google
  account with Quick Sight, make sure that your Google account
  has the following permissions:
  - `BigQuery Job User` at the `Project`
    level.
  - `BigQuery Data Viewer` at the `Dataset` or
    `Table` level.
  - `BigQuery Metadata Viewer` at the `Project`
    level.

Use the following procedure to connect your Quick account with your
Google BigQuery data source.

###### To create a new connection to a Google BigQuery data source

1. Open the [Quick console](https://quicksight.aws.amazon.com/ "https://quicksight.aws.amazon.com/").
2. From the left navigation pane, choose **Data**.
3. Choose **Create** then choose **New
   Dataset**
4. Choose the **Google BigQuery**
   tile.
5. Add the data source details that you recorded in the prerequisites section
   earlier:
   - **Data source name** – A name
     for the data source.
   - **Project ID** – A
     Google Platform project ID. This field is case
     sensitive.
   - **Dataset Region** – The
     Google cloud platform dataset region of the
     project that you want to connect to.

6. Choose **Sign in**.
7. In the new window that opens, enter the login credentials for the
   Google account that you want to connect to.
8. Choose **Continue** to grant Quick Sight access to
   Google BigQuery.
9. After you create the new data source connection, continue to [Step 4](#gbq-step-4 "#gbq-step-4") in the following procedure.

## Adding a new Quick Sight dataset for

Google BigQuery

After you create a data source connection with Google BigQuery, you
can create Google BigQuery datasets for analysis. Datasets that use
Google BigQuery can only be stored in
SPICE.

###### To create a dataset using Google BigQuery

1. Open the [Quick console](https://quicksight.aws.amazon.com/ "https://quicksight.aws.amazon.com/").
2. From the start page, choose **Data**.
3. Choose **Create**, then **New
   Dataset**
4. Choose the **Google BigQuery** tile, and
   then choose **Create dataset**.
5. For **Tables**, do one of the following:
   - Choose the table that you want to use.
   - Choose **Use custom SQL** to use your own
     personal SQL statement. For more information about using custom SQL
     in Quick Sight, see [Using SQL to customize data](adding-a-SQL-query.md "adding-a-SQL-query.md").

6. Choose **Edit/Preview**.
7. (Optional) In the **Data prep** page that opens, you can
   add customizations to your data with calculated fields, filters, and
