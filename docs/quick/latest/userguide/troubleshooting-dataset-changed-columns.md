# My visual can’t find

missing columns

The visuals in my analysis aren't working as expected. The error message says
`"The column(s) used in this visual do not exist."`

The most common cause of this error is that your data source schema changed. For
example, it's possible a column name changed from `a_column` to
`b_column`.

Depending on how your dataset accesses the data source, choose one of the
following.

- If the dataset is based on custom SQL, do one or more of the
  following:

      + Edit the dataset.
      + Edit the SQL statement.


      For example, if the table name changed from `a_column`
       to `b_column`, you can update the SQL statement to create
       an alias: `SELECT b_column as a_column`. By using the
       alias to maintain the same field name in the dataset, you avoid
       having to add the column to your visuals as a new entity.

  When you're done, choose **Save & visualize**.

- If the dataset isn't based on custom SQL, do one or more of the
  following:

      + Edit the dataset.
      + For fields that now have different names, rename them in the
       dataset. You can use the field names from your original dataset.
       Then open your analysis and add the renamed fields to the affected
       visuals.

  When you're done, choose **Save & visualize**.
