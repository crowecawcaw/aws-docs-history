# Security, privacy, and architecture

The Amazon Quick desktop application uses a local-first architecture designed to
keep your data private while providing full access to AI capabilities. Your
conversations, files, and personal context stay on your computer. The following
sections describe how Amazon Quick on desktop handles security, privacy, and data
storage.

###### Important

Your data is never used for AI model training. AWS does not use your
conversations, files, or personal context to train or improve AI models.

## Local-first architecture

The Amazon Quick desktop application runs most of its functionality locally on
your computer. The following components run entirely on your machine.

- **AI agent backend** – The agent
  runtime, including tool execution, skill loading, and task
  orchestration, runs as a local process on your machine.
- **Conversation history** – All
  chat messages, threads, and conversation metadata are stored and
  persisted locally.
- **Knowledge graph** – The entity
  graph that captures people, projects, customers, channels, events, and
  their relationships is built and queried locally.
- **Memory** – Learned facts,
  procedures, and preferences that personalize your experience are stored
  locally.
- **File indexing** – Keyword
  indexes, semantic search indexes, and knowledge graph extraction for
  your local folders are built and maintained on your machine.
- **Scheduled agents** – Background
  agents that run on recurring schedules execute locally. Your computer
  must be on and Quick must be running for agents to
  operate.
- **Artifacts and outputs** –
  Documents, images, visualizations, and other outputs that
  Quick generates are saved locally.

All Amazon Quick desktop application data is stored locally in the
`~/.quickwork/` directory on macOS or
`%USERPROFILE%\.quickwork\` on Windows. The following
table describes the data stored in this directory.

## Data storage

All Amazon Quick desktop application data is stored locally in the
`~/.quickwork/` directory on your computer. The following
table describes the data stored in this directory.

| Data type            | Description                                                                                        |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Conversations        | Chat messages, threads, and conversation metadata.                                                 |
| Knowledge graph      | Entity graph database containing people, projects, customers, channels, events, and relationships. |
| Memory               | Learned facts, procedures, tool strategies, and user preferences with confidence scores.           |
| File indexes         | Keyword search indexes and semantic search embeddings for granted folders.                         |
| Agent configurations | Scheduled agent definitions, schedules, prompts, and execution history.                            |
| Credentials          | Saved authentication tokens for connected third-party services.                                    |
| Artifacts            | Downloaded files, generated documents, images, and other outputs.                                  |
| Application settings | User preferences, theme selection, and configuration state.                                        |

## Folder permissions

Amazon Quick on desktop uses OS-level sandboxing to control file access.
Quick can only access folders that you explicitly grant permission
to, and you can revoke access at any time. Each folder supports independent
controls for keyword search indexing, semantic search indexing, and knowledge
graph extraction. You can also set granular per-operation permissions for
read and write operations.

To manage folder access and permissions, see
[My Computer](desktop-settings.md#desktop-settings-my-computer "desktop-settings.md#desktop-settings-my-computer").

## System tool permissions

Amazon Quick on desktop includes system tools that provide core capabilities.
Each tool can be individually toggled on or off and supports a three-tier
permission model (Full Access, Read Only, or Ask Each Time) with granular
per-operation controls. For a complete list of system tools and their
permissions, see [System tools](system-tools-desktop.md "system-tools-desktop.md").

## Connection security

Amazon Quick on desktop uses industry-standard security practices for
third-party service connections.

- **OAuth 2.0** – Services such as
  Slack, Google, and Microsoft use OAuth 2.0 for authentication.
  Quick redirects you to the service's sign-in page, and the
  service returns an authorization token. Quick never sees or
  stores your third-party passwords.
- **Independent connections** – Each
  connected service is managed independently. You can disconnect and
  reconnect any service at any time from **Settings** > **Capabilities** > **Connections** without affecting other connections.
- **Minimal permissions** –
  Quick requests only the permissions needed to provide its
  features for each connected service.

## Privacy controls

Amazon Quick on desktop provides privacy controls that let you manage whether
Quick learns from your conversations, searches your conversation
history, and extracts entities from connected services. You can also view, edit,
and delete individual memories. To configure privacy settings, see
[My Context](desktop-settings.md#desktop-settings-my-context "desktop-settings.md#desktop-settings-my-context").

## Clearing all data

If you need to completely reset Amazon Quick on desktop, you can use the
**Clear all data** option in **Settings** > **Customization** >
**Danger zone**. This action is irreversible and
removes all conversations, knowledge graph data, saved credentials, and user
preferences. For more information, see
[Danger zone](desktop-settings.md#desktop-settings-danger-zone "desktop-settings.md#desktop-settings-danger-zone").
