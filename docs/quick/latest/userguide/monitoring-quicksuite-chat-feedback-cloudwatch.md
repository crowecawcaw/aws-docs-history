# Monitoring Amazon Quick usage using CloudWatch Logs

You can use [Amazon CloudWatch Logs](../../../AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/AWS-logs-and-resource-policy.md "../../../AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/AWS-logs-and-resource-policy.md") to deliver chat conversations, user feedback, agent/research hours usage, and index storage usage in Amazon Quick for you to analyze. These logs can be delivered to multiple destinations, such as CloudWatch, Amazon S3, or Amazon Data Firehose (standard rates apply). We recommend that you set up vended logs shortly after enabling Amazon Quick AI features.

The following are examples of tasks you can complete with logs from Amazon Quick:

- Identify common user queries and pain points by reviewing the chat message content.
- Monitor the quality of responses by looking at metrics like `feedbackReason`.
- Understand user sentiment and satisfaction by analyzing the feedback data, including comments and usefulness ratings.
- Generate custom dashboards and reports to track key metrics and trends over time.
- Identify and Analyze cases where the chat returned no answer or the user query was blocked
- Monitor agent and research hours usage
- Track index storage usage across knowledge bases and Spaces

###### Important

Logs from conversations might include sensitive or personally identifiable data passed in the chats. You can filter out this information from your logs when setting up logs subscription. Or you can mask this data on your logs using CloudWatch Logs masking policies. For more information, see [Help protect sensitive log data with masking](../../../AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/mask-sensitive-log-data.md "../../../AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/mask-sensitive-log-data.md").

## Supported log destinations

Amazon Quick can deliver logs to the following destinations:

- **Amazon CloudWatch Logs** - For real-time monitoring and analysis
- **Amazon S3** - For long-term storage and batch processing
- **Amazon Data Firehose** - For streaming analytics and data transformation

## Prerequisites

Before you can enable logging, ensure you have:

- An active Amazon Quick instance with Enterprise or Professional subscriptions
- Appropriate IAM permissions to configure log delivery
- A destination configured for your logs (CloudWatch Logs, Amazon S3 bucket, or Firehose)

## Configure logging

To enable logging for Amazon Quick chat and feedback, you need to configure IAM permissions, create a delivery source and destination, and verify that logs are being delivered successfully.

###### Topics

- [Set up IAM permissions](#quicksuite-chat-feedback-setup-iam-permissions "#quicksuite-chat-feedback-setup-iam-permissions")
- [Configure log subscription](#quicksuite-chat-feedback-configure-log-subscription "#quicksuite-chat-feedback-configure-log-subscription")
- [Verify log delivery](#quicksuite-chat-feedback-verify-log-delivery "#quicksuite-chat-feedback-verify-log-delivery")

### Set up IAM permissions

To set up CloudWatch Logs for Amazon Quick, use the following IAM policy examples to grant the necessary permissions.

```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [{
        "Sid": "QuicksightLogDeliveryPermissions",
        "Effect": "Allow",
        "Action": "quicksight:AllowVendedLogDeliveryForResource",
        "Resource": "arn:aws:quicksight:region:account-id:account/account-id"
    }]
}
```

You must also allow the `delivery.logs.amazonaws.com` service principal in your customer managed AWS KMS key policy.

```
{
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Principal": {
        "Service": "delivery.logs.amazonaws.com"
    },
    "Action": [
        "kms:GenerateDataKey",
        "kms:Decrypt"
    ],
    "Resource": "*",
    "Condition": {
        "StringEquals": {
            "kms:EncryptionContext:SourceArn": "arn:partition:logs:region:account-id:*"
        }
    }
}
```

### Configure log subscription

For example IAM policies with all the required permissions for your specific logging destination, see [Enable logging from AWS services](../../../AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/AWS-logs-and-resource-policy.md "../../../AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/AWS-logs-and-resource-policy.md") in the _Amazon CloudWatch Logs User Guide_.

Create a delivery source with the [PutDeliverySource](../../../AmazonCloudWatchLogs/latest/APIReference/API_PutDeliverySource.md "../../../AmazonCloudWatchLogs/latest/APIReference/API_PutDeliverySource.md") CloudWatch Logs API operation. Give the delivery source a name and for `resourceArn`, specify the ARN of your application. For `logType`, specify `CHAT_LOGS`, `AGENT_HOURS_LOGS`, `FEEDBACK_LOGS`, or `INDEX_USAGE_LOGS`.

```
{
    "logType": "CHAT_LOGS",
    "name": "my-quick-suite-delivery-source",
    "resourceArn": "arn:aws:quicksight:your-region:your-account-id:account/account-id"
}
```

```
{
    "logType": "FEEDBACK_LOGS",
    "name": "my-quick-suite-delivery-source",
    "resourceArn": "arn:aws:quicksight:your-region:your-account-id:account/account-id"
}
```

```
{
    "logType": "AGENT_HOURS_LOGS",
    "name": "my-quick-suite-delivery-source",
    "resourceArn": "arn:aws:quicksight:your-region:your-account-id:account/account-id"
}
```

```
{
    "logType": "INDEX_USAGE_LOGS",
    "name": "my-quick-index-usage-delivery-source",
    "resourceArn": "arn:aws:quicksight:your-region:your-account-id:account/account-id"
}
```

To enable user conversation logging with the CloudWatch Logs API operations, you call the `PutDeliverySource`, `PutDeliveryDestination`, and `CreateDelivery` API operations.

###### Note

Logs would be available for the region mentioned in resource ARN in `PutDeliverySource` input.

### Verify log delivery

Once configured, verify that logs are being delivered to your destination:

- **Verify the setup:** Verify the list of deliveries that have been created in the account by using the `DescribeDeliveries` API in CloudWatch Logs.
- **CloudWatch Logs**: Check the specified log group for new log streams.
- **Amazon S3**: Monitor your bucket for new log files.
- **Firehose**: Verify data is flowing through your delivery stream.

## Log schema and format

Amazon Quick logs follow a structured schema with common fields shared across all log types and specific fields for chat and feedback logs.

### Common fields

All log events include these common fields:

}
```

## Index usage logs

Index usage logs capture per-source storage metrics for knowledge
bases and Spaces. Events are published whenever a change occurs
(created, updated, synced, or deleted).

- `consumed_index_size` – Total size (in bytes)
  consumed by the entire index. This is the authoritative
  total, not computed by summing individual sources.
- `source_type` – Type of source:
  `SPACE` or `KB`.
- `source_name` – Display name of the Space or
  knowledge base.
- `source_arn` – Full ARN of the source.
- `consumed_source_size` – Size (in bytes)
  consumed by this individual source.
- `consumed_source_doc_count` – Number of
  documents in this source.

The following is an example of index usage logs:

```
{
    "account_id": "111122223333",
    "event_timestamp": 1774911984257,
    "log_type": "INDEX_USAGE_LOGS",
    "user_arn": "arn:aws:quicksight::111122223333:user/default/user",
    "resource_arn": "arn:aws:quicksight:us-west-2:111122223333:account/111122223333",
    "consumed_index_size": 500000,
    "source_type": "SPACE",
    "source_name": "my-space",
    "source_arn": "arn:aws:quicksight:us-west-2:111122223333:space/2744af89-31b2-423b-93a2-69b0cd0d7fa1",
    "consumed_source_size": 244436,
    "consumed_source_doc_count": 2
}
```

###### Note

Events are published per source on change. Not all sources
emit events every day. To reconstruct the current state, use
the most recent event per `source_arn`.

For information about building dashboards and running queries
against index usage logs, see
[Monitor index storage usage](index-usage-monitoring.md "index-usage-monitoring.md").

###### Note

\* Fields marked with ‘\*’ do not get added by default to your log subscription. These need to be specified explicitly while calling CreateDelivery if required.

## Security considerations

- **Encryption**: Use customer-managed AWS KMS keys for sensitive data
- **Access control**: Implement least-privilege IAM policies
- **Data retention**: Configure appropriate retention policies for your compliance requirements
