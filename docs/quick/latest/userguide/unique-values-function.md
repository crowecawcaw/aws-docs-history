# Unique values computation

The unique values computation counts the unique values in a category field.
For example, you can create a computation to count the number of unique values
in a dimension, such as how many customers you have

To use this function, you need at least one dimension in the
**Categories** field well.

## Parameters

_name_

A unique descriptive name that you assign or change. A name is
assigned if you don't create your own. You can edit this
later.

_Category_

The category dimension that you want to rank.

## Computation

outputs

Each function generates a set of output parameters. You can add these
outputs to the autonarrative to customize what it displays. You can also add
your own custom text.

To locate the output parameters, open the
**Computations** tab on the right, and locate the
computation that you want to use. The names of the computations come from
the name you provide when you create the insight. Choose the output
parameter by clicking on it only once. If you click twice, you add the same
output twice. Items displayed in **bold** can
be used in the narrative.

- `categoryField` – The category field.
  - `**name**`
    – The display name of the category field.

- `**uniqueGroupValuesCount**` – The number of
  unique values included in this computation.
