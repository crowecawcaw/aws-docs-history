# Step 1: Set up permissions

###### Important

Amazon Quick Sight has new APIs for embedding analytics:
`GenerateEmbedUrlForAnonymousUser` and
`GenerateEmbedUrlForRegisteredUser`.

You can still use the `GetDashboardEmbedUrl` and
`GetSessionEmbedUrl` APIs to embed dashboards and the
Amazon Quick Sight console, but they do not contain the latest embedding
capabilities. For the latest up-to-date embedding experience, see [Embedding Amazon Quick Sight analytics into your
applications](../../../quicksight/latest/user/embedding-overview.md "../../../quicksight/latest/user/embedding-overview.md").

In the following section, you can find out how to set up permissions for the
backend application or web server. This task requires administrative access to
IAM.

Each user who accesses a Amazon Quick Sight assumes a role that gives them
Amazon Quick Sight access and permissions to the console session. To make this
possible, create an IAM role in your AWS account. Associate an IAM policy with the
role to provide permissions to any user who assumes it. Add
`quicksight:RegisterUser` permissions to ensure that the reader can
access Amazon Quick Sight in a read-only fashion, and not have access to any other
data or creation capability. The IAM role also needs to provide permissions to
retrieve console session URLs. For this, you add
`quicksight:GetSessionEmbedUrl`.

The following sample policy provides these permissions for use with
`IdentityType=IAM`.

JSON

```
`{
 "Version":"2012-10-17",
 "Statement": [
 {
 "Action": "quicksight:RegisterUser",
 "Resource": "*",
 "Effect": "Allow"
 },
 {
 "Action": "quicksight:GetSessionEmbedUrl",
 "Resource": "*",
 "Effect": "Allow"
 }
 ]
}`

```

The following sample policy provides permission to retrieve a console session URL.
You use the policy without `quicksight:RegisterUser` if you are creating
users before they access an embedded session.

JSON

```
`{
 "Version":"2012-10-17",
 "Statement": [
 {
 "Effect": "Allow",
 "Action": [
 "quicksight:GetSessionEmbedUrl"
 ],
 "Resource": "*"
 }
 ]
}`

```

If you use `QUICKSIGHT` as your `identityType` and provide
the user's Amazon Resource Name (ARN), you also need to allow the
`quicksight:GetAuthCode` action in your policy. The following sample
policy provides this permission.

JSON

```
`{
 "Version":"2012-10-17",
 "Statement": [
 {
 "Effect": "Allow",
 "Action": [
 "quicksight:GetSessionEmbedUrl",
 "quicksight:GetAuthCode"
 ],
 "Resource": "*"
 }
 ]
}`

```

Your application's IAM identity must have a trust policy associated with it
to allow access to the role that you just created. This means that when a user
accesses your application, your application can assume the role on the user's
behalf and provision the user in Amazon Quick Sight. The following example shows a
role called `embedding_quicksight_console_session_role`, which has the
sample policy preceding as its resource.
