| \*_Applies<br>to:_<br>• Enterprise Edition |

In the Enterprise edition of Amazon Quick, you can restrict access to a dataset by
configuring row-level security (RLS) on it. You can do this before or after you have shared
the dataset. When you share a dataset with RLS with dataset owners, they can still see all
the data. When you share it with readers, however, they can only see the data restricted by
the permission dataset rules.

Also, when you embed Amazon Quick dashboards in your application for unregistered users of
Quick, you can use row-level security (RLS) to filter/restrict data with tags. A tag is a user-specified string
that identifies a session in your application. You can use tags to implement RLS controls for your datasets.
By configuring RLS-based restrictions in datasets, Quick filters the data based on the session tags tied to the user identity/session.

You can restrict access to a dataset using username or group-based rules, tag-based rules,
or both.

Choose user-based rules if you want to secure data for users or groups provisioned
(registered) in Quick. To do so, select a permissions dataset that contains rules set
by columns for each user or group accessing the data. Only users or groups identified in the
rules have access to data.

Choose tag-based rules only if you are using embedded dashboards and want to secure data
for users not provisioned (unregistered users) in Quick. To do so, define tags on
columns to secure data. Values to tags must be passed when embedding dashboards.
