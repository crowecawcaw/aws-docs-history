Use this section to learn how to explore AWS data in Amazon Quick using the AWS Management Console.
Using the **Explore in Amazon Quick Sight** shortcut, you can access a customizable
dashboard template showing your data. Just as with any Amazon Quick Sight dashboard, this dashboard can
be refreshed on a schedule, published, and shared with other users in your organization.

To use this feature, you must first enable Amazon S3 analytics storage class analysis for your
Amazon S3 buckets. For more on enabling storage class analysis in Amazon S3, see [Amazon Amazon S3 analytics – Storage
class analysis](../../../AmazonS3/latest/userguide/analytics-storage-class.md "../../../AmazonS3/latest/userguide/analytics-storage-class.md") in the _Amazon Amazon S3 Developer Guide._

After you have enabled storage class analysis, you can use Amazon Quick to explore your
Amazon S3 analytics data.

###### To explore Amazon S3 analytics data in Amazon Quick

1. Open the Amazon S3 console at
   [https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/ "https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/").
2. Choose a bucket to explore. The bucket must have storage class analysis enabled,
   with at least one filter.
3. Choose the **Management** tab.
4. Then choose **Analytics**.
5. Choose **Explore in QuickSight**.

###### Note

If you don't have an Amazon Quick account, you're prompted to create one
before you can use the dashboard.
When you choose the option to explore in Amazon Quick, your Amazon S3 analytics data is
automatically loaded into the dashboard template. The dashboard contains multiple
visualizations to help you to understand the storage access pattern of your bucket.

Use the template as is, or customize it to suit your needs. For example, one visual on the
default template helps you identify infrequently accessed data. It compares the amount of
data retrieved to the amount of storage consumed, for objects of different ages.

You can also add your own visualizations to the dashboard. For example, you can break down
the data access patterns, using filters for storage class analysis that you already have
defined in Amazon S3 analytics.

To learn more about using S3 analytics and storage class analysis, see [Amazon Amazon S3 analytics – Storage
class analysis](../../../AmazonS3/latest/userguide/analytics-storage-class.md "../../../AmazonS3/latest/userguide/analytics-storage-class.md") in the _Amazon Amazon S3 Developer
Guide._
