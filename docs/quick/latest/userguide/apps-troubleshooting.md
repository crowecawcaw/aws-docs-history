# Troubleshooting apps in Quick

This section describes common issues and how to resolve them.

## Recovering from content policy violations

If you receive the error "This request could not be processed due to content policy
violations":

1. Close the apps in Quick editor.
2. Wait 15 to 20 minutes for the session to reset.
3. Reopen the app.
4. Try a simpler, more focused prompt.

All prompts in the same session after a violation continue to fail until the session
resets.

## Recovering from a broken app

If an app stops loading or displays errors after an edit:

1. Use the version selector to restore a previous working version.
2. If the editor is not accessible, close the browser tab, wait 15 to 20 minutes,
   and reopen.
3. In a fresh session, try: "Review all app code. Check the existing code
   against the actual types and interfaces exported by the runtime library. Fix any
   issues."
4. If an integration change caused the issue, try: "The prior issue impacting
   integrations has been resolved. Please try again."

## Fixing connector authentication issues

If you see a "Sign in to connectors" dialog with no sign-in option, one or more
integrations were not properly registered during app creation. In the editor, ask the
agent to retry registering each affected connector individually. After successful
re-registration, publish the updated app.

## Debugging complex apps

You can ask the agent to add a debug panel that logs storage operations, integration
calls, and state changes. Make the panel visible only to yourself (based on your user
alias) to keep it hidden from end users.

## File export not working

If an export feature does not work, ask the agent: "Use the
`downloadFile` function from the runtime library to handle the file export."
The sandbox blocks direct browser APIs for file creation. For more information, see
