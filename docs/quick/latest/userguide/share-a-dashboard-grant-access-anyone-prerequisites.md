# Before

you start

Before you can share a dashboard with anyone on the internet, make sure to
do the following:

1. Turn on session capacity pricing on your account. If you have not
   turned on session capacity pricing on your account, you won't be
   able to update your account's public sharing settings.
2. Assign public sharing permissions to an administrative user in the
   IAM console. You can add these permissions with a new policy or
   you can add the new permissions to an existing user.

The following sample policy provides permissions for use with
`UpdatePublicSharingSettings`.

JSON

```
`{
"Version":"2012-10-17",
 "Statement": [
 {
 "Action": "quicksight:UpdatePublicSharingSettings",
 "Resource": "*",
 "Effect": "Allow"
 }
 ]
}`

```

Accounts that don't want users with administrator access to use
this feature can add an IAM policy that denies public sharing
permissions. The following sample policy denies permissions for use
with `UpdatePublicSharingSettings`.

JSON

```
`{
"Version":"2012-10-17",
 "Statement": [
 {
 "Action": "quicksight:UpdatePublicSharingSettings",
 "Resource": "*",
 "Effect": "Deny"
 }
 ]
}`

```

For more information on using IAM with Quick Sight, see [Using Quick with
IAM](security_iam_service-with-iam.md "security_iam_service-with-iam.md").

You can also use the "Deny" policy as a Service Control Policy
(SCP) if you don't want any of the accounts in your organization to
have the public sharing feature. For more information, see [Service control policies (SCPs)](../../../organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_policies_scps.md "../../../organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_policies_scps.md") in the
_AWS Organizations User Guide_. 3. Turn on public sharing on your Amazon Quick account.

    1. From the Amazon Quick start page, choose your user icon at
     the upper right of your browser window, and then choose
     **Manage Quick**.
    2. In the page that opens, scroll down to the
     **Permissions** section.
    3. Choose **Public access to dashboards** at
     left.
    4. On the page that opens, choose **Anyone on the
     internet**.


    When you turn on this setting, a pop up will appear asking
     you to confirm your choice. Once you've confirmed your
     choice, you can grant the public access to specific
     dashboards and share those dashboards with them with a link
     or by embedding the dashboard in a public application, wiki,
     or portal.
