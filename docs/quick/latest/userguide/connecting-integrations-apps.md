# Connecting to integrations in apps in Quick

You can connect your apps in Quick apps to external services and data sources through the
integration framework in Amazon Quick. The same integration model used elsewhere in
Quick applies in apps in Quick. The agent registers integrations
on your app, and you and your users authorize them. For more information about integrations,
see [Work with integrations in Amazon Quick](working-with-integrations.md "working-with-integrations.md").

## Prerequisites

Before you connect integrations, confirm the following:

- You have an active Amazon Quick account with Author Pro or higher access.
- Your administrator has enabled the connectors you plan to use.

## Integration types

Quick organizes integrations into two categories:

- **Knowledge integrations** — Connect to
  data sources that the system can search and reason over. In apps in Quick, this is
  most commonly a Amazon Quick space used as a knowledge base for an embedded chat
  experience.
- **Action integrations** — Connect to
  external applications and services where your app can read data, write data, or
  perform operations. Examples include Microsoft Outlook, SharePoint, OneDrive,
  Slack, Jira, and Asana. Quick provides over 100 pre-built action
  connectors. You can also create custom connectors using REST API, OpenAPI, or MCP
  specifications.

## Authentication models

Action integrations support two authentication models:

- **User authentication** — The integration
  uses the credentials of the individual end user. Every user must have their own
  access to the connected resource.
- **Service authentication** — The
  integration uses a service-level credential configured by an administrator. All
  users of the app share that access. Not all connectors support service
  authentication.

## Adding an integration to your app

You do not need to set up integrations manually. To add an integration:

1. Ask the agent to use a specific service in your instructions. For example:
   "Connect to my Outlook calendar and display my meetings for this week."
2. Authorize the integration when the agent prompts you.
3. Verify that the integration appears in the Assets view.

When other users open the published app, they authorize their own
credentials for each registered integration on first use.

## How apps in Quick works with other Quick capabilities

Apps in Quick connects to several other capabilities within Amazon Quick:

- **Amazon Quick spaces** — An app can read
  files from a space, write new files to it, and use a space as the knowledge base
  for an embedded chat experience. For more information, see
  [Organize, collaborate, and share resources with spaces in Amazon Quick](working-with-spaces.md "working-with-spaces.md").
- **Amazon Quick Flows** — There is no direct
  integration between apps in Quick and Quick Flows. Use a space as a shared data
  layer instead. A flow processes data and saves its output to
  a space. The app reads from that space and displays the results. For more
  information, see
  [Using Amazon Quick automations](using-amazon-quick-automations.md "using-amazon-quick-automations.md").

## Integration tips

- **Outlook and OneDrive** — These connectors
  do not reliably resolve the `me` alias in API calls. Instruct the
  agent to use the user identity API to retrieve the current user's information
  instead.
- **Slack** — The Slack connector's API
  schema does not include all available Slack API operations. Provide specific
  details about the Slack API operations you need, such as the channel ID and
  message format.
- **Integration removal** — You cannot
  currently remove a registered integration from an app through the settings UI. As
  a workaround, ask the agent to remove references to the integration in the
  app code.

###### Tip

**Limited integrations in public apps** —
Public apps do not support connectors, embedded visuals, embedded chat
experiences, or Amazon Quick spaces. If you plan to publish your app publicly,
design it to use only shared storage and AI inference.
