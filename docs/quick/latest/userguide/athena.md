# Authorizing connections to Amazon Athena
<a name="athena"></a>

If you need use Amazon Quick Sight with Amazon Athena or Amazon Athena Federated Query, you first need to authorize connections to Athena and the associated buckets in Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3). Amazon Athena is an interactive query service that makes it easy to analyze data directly in Amazon S3 using standard SQL. Athena Federated Query provides access to more types of data by using AWS Lambda. Using a connection from Quick to Athena, you can write SQL queries to interrogate data that's stored in relational, non-relational, object, and custom data sources. For more information, see [ Using Athena federated query](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/athena/latest/ug/connect-to-a-data-source.html) in the Amazon Athena User Guide. 

Review the following considerations when setting up access to Athena from Quick:
+ Athena stores query results from Amazon Quick Sight in a bucket. By default, this bucket has a name similar to `aws-athena-query-results-AWSREGION-AWSACCOUNTID`, for example `aws-athena-query-results-us-east-2-111111111111`. Therefore, it's important to make sure Amazon Quick Sight has permissions to access the bucket Athena is currently using.
+ If your data file is encrypted with an AWS KMS key, grant permissions to the Amazon Quick Sight IAM role to decrypt the key. The easiest way to do this is to use the AWS CLI. 

  You can run the KMS [create-grant](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/kms/create-grant.html) API operation in AWS CLI to do this. 

  ```
  aws kms create-grant --key-id <KMS_KEY_ARN> /
  --grantee-principal <QS_ROLE_ARN> --operations Decrypt
  ```

  The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the Amazon Quick role has the format `arn:aws:iam::<account id>:role/service-role/aws-quicksight-s3-consumers-role-v<version number>` and can be accessed from the IAM console. To find your KMS key ARN, use the S3 console. Go to the bucket that contains your data file and choose the **Overview** tab. The key is located near **KMS key ID**.
+ For Amazon Athena, Amazon S3, and Athena Query Federation connections, Amazon Quick uses the following IAM role by default: 

  ```
  arn:aws:iam::{{AWS-ACCOUNT-ID}}:role/service-role/aws-quicksight-s3-consumers-role-v0
  ```

  If the `aws-quicksight-s3-consumers-role-v0` is not present, then Amazon Quick uses:

  ```
  arn:aws:iam::{{AWS-ACCOUNT-ID}}:role/service-role/aws-quicksight-service-role-v0
  ```
+ If you assigned scope-down policies to your users, verify that the policies contain the `lambda:InvokeFunction` permission. Without this permission, your users can't access Athena Federated Queries. For more information about assigning IAM policies to your users in Amazon Quick, see [Setting granular access to AWS services through IAM](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/quicksight/latest/user/scoping-policies-iam-interface.html). For more information about the lambda:InvokeFunction permission, see [Actions, resources, and condition keys for AWS Lambda](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/list_awslambda.html) in the *IAM User Guide*.

**To authorize Amazon Quick to connect to Athena or Athena federated data sources**

1. (Optional) If you are using AWS Lake Formation with Athena, you also need to enable Lake Formation. For more information, see [Authorizing connections through AWS Lake Formation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/quicksight/latest/user/lake-formation.html). 

1. Open your profile menu at top right and choose **Manage QuickSight**. You must be a Amazon Quick administrator to do this. If you don't see **Manage QuickSight** on the profile menu, you don't have sufficient permissions. 

1. Choose **Security & permissions**, **Add or remove**. 

1. Choose the box near Amazon Athena, **Next**. 

   If it was already enabled, you might have to double-click it. Do this even if Amazon Athena is already enabled, so you can view the settings. No changes are saved until you choose **Update** at the end of this procedure.

1.  Enable the S3 buckets you want to access.

1. (Optional) To enable Athena federated queries, select the Lambda functions you want to use. 
**Note**  
You can only see Lambda functions for the Athena catalogs in the same region of Amazon Quick.

1. To confirm your changes, choose **Finish**.

   To cancel, choose **Cancel**.

1. To save changes to security and permissions, choose **Update**.

**To test the connection authorization settings**

1. From the Amazon Quick start page, choose **Datasets**, **New dataset**.

1. Choose the Athena card.

1. Follow the screen prompts to create a new Athena data source using the resources you need to connect to. Choose **Validate connection** to test the connection.

1. If the connection validates, you have successfully configured an Athena or Athena Federated Query connection.

   If you don't have sufficient permissions to connect to an Athena dataset or run an Athena query, an error displays directing you to contact a Amazon Quick administrator. This error means need to recheck your connection authorization settings to find the discrepancy. 

1. After you can connect successfully, you or your Amazon Quick authors can create data sources connections and share them with other Amazon Quick authors. The authors can then create multiple datasets from the connections, to use in Amazon Quick dashboards.

   For troubleshooting information on Athena, see [Connectivity issues when using Athena with Amazon Quick](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/quicksight/latest/user/troubleshoot-athena.html).

## Using trusted identity propagation with Athena
<a name="athena-trusted-identity-propagation"></a>

Trusted identity propagation gives AWS services access to AWS resources based on the user’s identity context and securely shares this user’s identity with other AWS services. These capabilities enable user access to be more easily defined, granted, and logged.

When administrators configure Quick, Athena, Amazon S3 Access Grants, and AWS Lake Formation with IAM Identity Center, they can now enable trusted identity propagation across these services and allow the user’s identity to be propagated across services. When data is accessed from Quick by an IAM Identity Center user, Athena or Lake Formation can make authorization decisions using the permissions defined for their user or group membership from the organization’s identity provider.

Trusted identity propagation with Athena only works when permissions are managed through Lake Formation. User permissions to data reside in Lake Formation.

### Prerequisites
<a name="athena-trusted-identity-propagation-prerequisites"></a>

Before you get started, make sure that you have the following required prerequisites completed.

**Important**  
As you complete the following prerequisites, note that your IAM Identity Center instance, Athena workgroup, Lake Formation and Amazon S3 Access Grants must all be deployed in the same AWS Region.
+ Configure your Quick account with IAM Identity Center. Trusted identity propagation is only supported for Quick accounts that are integrated with IAM Identity Center. For more information, see [Configure your Amazon Quick account with IAM Identity Center](setting-up-sso.md#sec-identity-management-identity-center).
**Note**  
To create Athena data sources, you must be an IAM Identity Center user (author) in a Quick account that uses IAM Identity Center.
+ An Athena workgroup that is enabled with IAM Identity Center. The Athena workgroup that you use must be using the same IAM Identity Center instance as the Quick account. For more information about configuring an Athena workgroup, see [Creating an IAM Identity Center enabled Athena workgroup.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/athena/latest/ug/workgroups-identity-center.html#workgroups-identity-center-creating-an-identity-center-enabled-athena-workgroup) in the *Amazon Athena User Guide*. 
+ Access to Athena query results bucket is managed with Amazon S3 Access Grants. For more details, see [Managing access with Amazon S3 Access Grants](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/access-grants.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*. If your query results are encrypted with an AWS KMS key, the Amazon S3 Access Grant IAM role and the Athena workgroup role both need permissions to AWS KMS.
  + For more information, see [Amazon S3 Access Grants and corporate directory identities](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/access-grants.html) in the Amazon S3 User Guide.
  + The Amazon S3 Access Grant role should have the `STS:SetContext` action in its trust policy for identity propagation. To see an example, see [Register a location](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/access-grants-location-register.html) in the Amazon S3 User Guide.
+ Permissions to data must be managed with Lake Formation and Lake Formation must be configured with the same IAM Identity Center instance as Quick and the Athena workgroup. For configuration information, see [Integrating IAM Identity Center](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lake-formation/latest/dg/identity-center-integration.html) in the *AWS Lake Formation Developer Guide*.
+ The data lake administrator needs to grant permissions to IAM Identity Center users and groups in Lake Formation. For more details, [Granting permissions to users and groups](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lake-formation/latest/dg/grant-permissions-sso.html) in the *AWS Lake Formation Developer Guide*.
+ The Quick administrator needs to authorize connections to Athena. For details, see [Authorizing connections to Amazon Athena](#athena). Note, with trusted identity propagation, you do not need to give the Quick role Amazon S3 bucket permissions or AWS KMS permissions. You need to keep your users and groups that have permissions to the workgroup in Athena in sync with the Amazon S3 bucket that stores query results with Amazon S3 Access Grants permissions so that users can successfully run queries and retrieve query results in the Amazon S3 bucket using trusted identity propagation.

### Configure IAM role with required permissions
<a name="athena-trusted-identity-propagation-configure-role"></a>

To use trusted identity propagation with Athena, your Quick account must have the required permissions to access your resources. To provide those permissions, you must configure your Quick account to use an IAM role with the permissions.

If your Quick account is already using a custom IAM role, you can modify that one. If you do not have an existing IAM role, create one by following the instructions in [Create a role for an IAM user](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-user.html) in the *IAM User Guide*.

The IAM role you create or modify must contain the following trust policy and permissions.

#### Required trust policy
<a name="athena-trusted-identity-propagation-configure-role-trust-policy"></a>

For information about updating the trust policy of an IAM role, see [Update a role trust policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_update-role-trust-policy.html).

#### Required Athena permissions
<a name="athena-trusted-identity-propagation-configure-role-permissions"></a>

For information about updating the trust policy of an IAM role, see [Update permissions for a role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_update-role-permissions.html).

**Note**  
The `Resource` uses the `*` wildcard. We recommend that you update it to include only the Athena resources you want to use with Quick.

    ]
}
```

### Configure your Quick account to use the IAM role
<a name="athena-trusted-identity-propagation-configure-role"></a>

After configuring the IAM role in the previous step, you must configure your Quick account to use it. For information about how to do that, see [Using existing IAM roles in Quick](security-create-iam-role.md#security-create-iam-role-use).

### Update the identity propogation config with the AWS CLI
<a name="athena-trusted-identity-propagation-update-config"></a>

To authorize Quick to propagate end user identities to Athena workgroups, run the following `update-identity-propagation-config` API from the AWS CLI, replacing the following values:
+ Replace {{us-west-2}} with the AWS Region that your IAM Identity Center instance is in.
+ Replace {{111122223333}} with your AWS account ID.

```
aws quicksight update-identity-propagation-config \
--service ATHENA \
--region {{us-west-2}} \
--aws-account-id {{111122223333}}
```

### Create an Athena dataset in Quick
<a name="athena-trusted-identity-propagation-create-dataset"></a>

Now, create an Athena dataset in Quick configured with the IAM Identity Center enabled Athena workgroup you want to connect to. For information about how to create an Athena dataset, see [Creating a dataset using Amazon Athena data](create-a-data-set-athena.md).

### Key callouts, considerations, and limits
<a name="athena-trusted-identity-propagation-callouts-considerations"></a>

The following list contains some important considerations when using trusted identity propagation with Quick and Athena.
+ Quick Athena data sources that use trusted identity propagation have Lake Formation permissions evaluated against the IAM Identity Center end user and the IAM Identity Center groups that the user might belong to.
+ When using Athena data sources that use trusted identity propagation, we recommend any fine tuned access control is done in Lake Formation. However, If you elect to use Quick’s scope down policy feature, scope down policies will be evaluated against the end user.
+ The following features are disabled for data sources and data sets that use trusted identity propagation: SPICE datasets, Custom SQL on data sources, threshold alerts, email reports, Q Topics, stories, scenarios, CSV, Excel, and PDF exports, anomaly detection.
+ If you experience high latency or timeouts, it may be because of a combination of high number of IAM Identity Center groups, Athena databases, tables, and Lake Formation rules. We recommend trying to use only the necessary number of those resources.
