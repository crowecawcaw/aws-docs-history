  {{measure}} 
  ,{{[ sortorder_field ASC_or_DESC, ... ] }} 
  ,{{[ partition_field, ... ]}}

```

## Arguments
<a name="runningMax-function-arguments"></a>

 *measure*   
An aggregated measure that you want to see the running maximum for. 

 *sort order field*   
One or more measures and dimensions that you want to sort the data by, separated by commas. You can specify either ascending (**ASC**) or descending (**DESC**) sort order.   
Each field in the list is enclosed in {} (curly braces), if it is more than one word. The entire list is enclosed in [ ] (square brackets).

 *partition field*

## Example
<a name="runningMax-function-example"></a>

The following example calculates a running maximum of `sum(Sales)`, sorted by `Sales`, partitioned by `City` and `State`.

```
runningMax
(
  sum(Sales), 
  [Sales ASC], 
  [City, State]
)
```

The following example calculates a running maximum of `Billed Amount`, sorted by month (`[truncDate("MM",Date) ASC]`). The fields in the table calculation are in the field wells of the visual.

```
runningMax
(
  sum({Billed Amount}),
  [truncDate("MM",Date) ASC]
)
```
