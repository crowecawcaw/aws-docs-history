# Adding and managing sheets

A _sheet_ is a set of visuals that are viewed together in a single
page. When you create an analysis, you place visuals in the workspace on a sheet. You
can imagine this as a sheet from a newspaper, except that it is filled with data
visualizations. You can add more sheets, and make them work separately or together in
your analysis.

The top sheet, also called the default sheet, is the one on the far left. This sheet
displays on top in an analysis or dashboard. Each analysis can contain up to 20
sheets.

You can share analyses and publish dashboards with multiple sheets. You can also
schedule email reports for any combination of sheets in an analysis.

When you create a new analysis or a new sheet in an existing analysis, you choose
whether to make the new sheet an **Interactive sheet** or a
**Pixel perfect report**. This way, you can have analyses for
interactive sheets only, analyses for pixel perfect reports only, or you can have an
analysis that includes both interactive sheets and pixel perfect reports.

An _Interactive Sheet_ is a collection of data expressed in visuals
that users can interact with when the sheet is published to a dashboard. Amazon Quick
authors can add different controls and filters to their interactive sheets. Dashboard
viewers can use these to gain detailed information from the published data. For more
information on interactive sheets, see [Working with interactive sheets in Amazon Quick Sight](../../../quicksight/latest/user/working-with-interactive-sheets.md "../../../quicksight/latest/user/working-with-interactive-sheets.md").

A _Paginated Report_ is a collection of tables, charts, and visuals
that are used to convey business critical information, such as daily transaction
summaries or weekly business reports. In order to create pixel perfect reports in
Quick Sight, add the **Pixel perfect reporting Add-on** to your
Quick account. To get the **Pixel perfect reporting Add-on**
and start working with pixel perfect reports, see [Working
with pixel perfect reports in Amazon Quick Sight](../../../quicksight/latest/user/working-with-reports.md "../../../quicksight/latest/user/working-with-reports.md").

Use the following list of actions to work with sheets:

- To add a new sheet, choose the plus sign (+) to the right of the sheet
  tabs, choose the type of sheet that you want, and then choose
  **ADD**.
- To rename a sheet, choose the name of the sheet and start typing.
  **Rename** is also available from the sheet menu.
- To duplicate a sheet, choose the name of the sheet, then choose
  **Duplicate** from the sheet menu. You can only duplicate a
  sheet if **Autosave** is turned on.
- To duplicate an interactive sheet and convert it to a pixel perfect report, choose
  the name of the sheet, then choose **Duplicate to report** from
  the sheet menu. You can't convert a pixel perfect report to an interactive
  sheet.
- To delete a sheet, choose the name of the sheet, then choose
  **Delete** from the sheet menu. You can't delete the
  sheet if it's the only sheet in the analysis.
- To change the order of the sheets, choose the name of the sheet and drag it to
  a new position.
- To copy a visual to a new sheet, choose **Duplicate visual
  to** from the on-visual menu. Then choose the target sheet. Filters
  exist only on the sheet that you create them on. To duplicate filters, recreate
  them on the target sheet.
- To highlight specific data points across visuals in a sheet, go to the
  **Sheets** tab and select **Layout
  Settings**. Under the **Interactivity** section,
  select either **On selection** or **On hover**
  to turn highlighting on, or **No highlight** to turn it off. By
  default, sheet highlighting follows the same settings as analysis
  highlighting.

When you select or hover over a data point on a visual, related data across
other visuals will stand out, while unrelated data is dimmed. Highlighting
allows you to understand correlations, spot patterns, trends, and outliers, and
facilitate stronger, more informed analyses.
You can use the parameter controls on the top sheet to control multiple sheets. To do
this, open each sheet that you want to work with the parameter. Then add a filter that
uses the same parameter used in the control on the top sheet. Or, if you want a new
sheet to operate independently, you can add parameters and parameter controls to it that
are separate from those on the top sheet.
