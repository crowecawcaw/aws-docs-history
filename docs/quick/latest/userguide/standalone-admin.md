# Managing a Amazon Quick Free or Plus account
<a name="standalone-admin"></a>

Amazon Quick Free and Plus accounts – created through the direct signup process at [aws.com/quick](https://aws.com/quick) – include a built-in administration interface for managing your account, users, assets, billing, and support. This interface is accessible directly within the Amazon Quick web application, without requiring access to the AWS Management Console.

**Note**  
This section applies to Amazon Quick Free and Plus accounts only. If your organization accesses Amazon Quick through the AWS Management Console, see [Administering Amazon Quick](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/quicksuite/latest/userguide/qsysadmin.html) for information about managing your account using IAM, IAM Identity Center, and other AWS services.

## Account administration overview

When you create a Amazon Quick Free or Plus account at aws.com/quick, the person who completes the signup process is automatically assigned the **administrator** role. As the account administrator, you have full access to all account management capabilities, including user management, asset oversight, plan and billing configuration, and support resources.

Free and Plus account administration is organized into the following sections:

| --- | --- | 
| Users | Invite team members, manage active users, view usage statistics, and manage pending invitations. For more information, see [Managing users in a Amazon Quick Free or Plus account](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/quicksuite/latest/userguide/standalone-users.html). |

| Plan and billing | View your current plan, estimated charges, payment methods, and billing history. Upgrade or change your plan.

The following table summarizes the key differences between Free and Plus account administration and AWS Console–based administration.


| Feature | Free or Plus account (aws.com/quick) | AWS Console account | 
| --- | --- | --- | 
| Identity provider | Email or social login | IAM Identity Center, IAM, or federated identity | 
| Admin interface | Built-in Quick web UI (Manage Account page) | AWS Management Console | 
| User management | Email-based invitations | IAM Identity Center groups, IAM users | 
| Billing | Billing portal (account.global.app.aws) | AWS Billing and Cost Management console |

Regardless of how your Amazon Quick account was created, all product features – including chat, chat agents, spaces, research, automations, Amazon Quick Sight, integrations, and extensions – function identically. The differences are limited to account setup, identity management, and billing.
