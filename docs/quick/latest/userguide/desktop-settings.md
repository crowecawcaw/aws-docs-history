# Settings

You can configure the Amazon Quick desktop application through the **Settings** panel. To open Settings, choose the gear icon at the
bottom of the sidebar. Settings are organized into four categories: **Capabilities**, **My computer**,
**My context**, and **Customization**.

## Capabilities

The Capabilities settings control the tools, integrations, and extensions
available to Quick. The Capabilities page is organized into five
tabs: **Connections**, **Skills**, **Scheduled tasks**, **MCP**, and **System**.

To open Capabilities, choose **Settings** in the
sidebar and then choose **Capabilities**.

### Connections tab

The Connections tab is where you connect messaging, email, cloud storage,
and other external services to Quick. When you connect a
service, Quick can access the information in that service to
provide more relevant and personalized responses.

#### Authentication

At the top of the Connections tab, the **Authentication** section displays your sign-in status.
Quick uses Amazon Federate for Bedrock and
Quick Web access. You must be signed in to use AI models
and access Quick Web features.

To sign out, choose **Sign out** in the
Authentication section.

#### Built-in connections

Quick provides connections to popular services.
Each connection has a **Sign
in** button that opens a sign-in page for the service and
returns you to Quick automatically.

You can use the **Search connections**
bar and **filter dropdown** to find
specific connections.

#### Browse more connections

Below the built-in connections, the **Browse more
connections** section provides a link to Quick on
the web, where you can browse and add additional connections such as
project management tools, CRMs, and developer platforms. Connections
added on the web appear automatically in the desktop
application.

### Skills tab

The Skills tab lets you view, create, and manage skills. You can create
custom skills with AI or by uploading a `SKILL.md` file, and
you can toggle built-in skills on or off. For more information about
skills, see [Skills and agents](skills-and-agents-desktop.md "skills-and-agents-desktop.md").

### Scheduled Tasks tab

The Scheduled Tasks tab lets you view and manage automated agents that
run on a recurring schedule. Each agent has four configuration tabs:
Overview, Schedule, Capabilities, and Prompt. For more information about
scheduled agents, see [Skills and agents](skills-and-agents-desktop.md "skills-and-agents-desktop.md").

###### Important

Scheduled agents run locally on your computer. Your computer must be
turned on and the Amazon Quick desktop application must be running for
scheduled agents to execute at their configured times.

### MCP tab

The MCP (Model Context Protocol) tab lets you connect custom MCP servers
to extend Quick capabilities with additional tools. You can add
local, imported, or remote MCP servers, and configure coding agents. For
more information, see [Configuring MCP servers](mcp-servers-desktop.md "mcp-servers-desktop.md").

### System tab

The System tab displays the built-in system tools that provide core
capabilities to Quick. Each tool has an enable/disable toggle
and a **Manage permissions** button for
granular access control. For more information, see
[System tools](system-tools-desktop.md "system-tools-desktop.md").

## My Computer

The My Computer settings control how Quick accesses and indexes
files on your local machine.

To open My Computer, choose **Settings** in the
sidebar and then choose **My computer**.

At the top of the page, the **My computer** card
shows the connection status. Choose the three-dot menu next to the card to
access **Manage permissions**.

### Manage permissions

The Manage Permissions panel provides granular control over file
operations. It includes the following controls.

- **Access Level** – Choose
  Full Access (Read & write), Read Only (View only), or Ask

  Page Raster, File Rag Search, File Rag Status.
- **Write Operations** (6
  operations) – File Write, File Edit, File Move, File Copy,
  File Delete, Folder Create.

Each operation has its own permission dropdown that you can set
independently.

### Local folders

The **Local folders** section lists the
folders you have granted Quick access to. For each folder, the
following information and options are displayed.

- **Folder name and path** –
  The name and full path of the folder.
- **File count** – The number
  of files in the folder.
- **Last indexed** – When the
  folder was last indexed.

Each folder has three indexing options that you can toggle
independently.

| Option                            | Description                                                                                                                                                                  |
| --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Keyword<br>search**             | Builds a keyword index of file contents for fast text<br>search. When enabled, displays the index status (Ready or<br>Indexing), file count, entry count, and index<br>size. |
| **Semantic<br>search**            | Builds a semantic (vector) index of file contents for<br>meaning-based search.                                                                                               |
| **Knowledge graph<br>extraction** | Extracts entities and relationships from files and<br>adds them to your personal knowledge graph.                                                                            |

To add a new folder, choose **+ Add
folder** at the bottom of the Local folders section.

### Search indexing

The **Search indexing** section displays
storage metrics and lets you configure indexing limits.

- **Disk space bar** – Shows
  your current free disk space. Indexing automatically stops when
  free space falls below 8.0 GiB.
- **Local folder and graph
  storage** – Shows how much storage is used by
  indexes and graph data.
- **Storage limit** – Slider
  that sets the maximum disk space for the knowledge database.
  Indexing pauses when this limit is reached.
- **Max file size for indexing**
  – Slider that sets the maximum size of individual files to
  index. Files larger than this are skipped during indexing but are
  still available to the agent through direct search.
- **Max folder size for
  indexing** – Slider that sets the maximum total
  indexable content for a folder. Folders exceeding this limit are
  not ingested. You can increase the limit and retry.

## My Context

The My Context settings manage how Quick builds and uses knowledge
about you and your work. The page has two tabs — **Knowledge graph** and **Memory** —
and a **Configuration** button in the upper-right
corner.

To open My Context, choose **Settings** in the
sidebar and then choose **My context**.

### Knowledge graph tab

The Knowledge graph tab displays an interactive visualization of the
entities and relationships that Quick has extracted from your
connected data sources. You can search, browse, and explore entities and
their connections. For more information, see
[Knowledge graph](knowledge-graph-desktop.md "knowledge-graph-desktop.md").

### Memory tab

The Memory tab displays the facts, procedures, and patterns that
Quick has learned from your conversations.

The following table describes the filtering and search controls.

| Control                        | Description                                             |
