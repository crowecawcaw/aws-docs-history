# Conditional formatting on visual

types in Quick

In some visual types, you can add conditional formatting to highlight some of your
data. The conditional formatting options currently supported include changing text or
background color and using symbolic icons. You can use icons from the provided set, or
you can use Unicode icons instead.

Conditional formatting is available on the following visuals:

- Gauge charts
- Key performance indicators (KPIs)
- Pivot tables
- Tables
  For tables and pivot tables, you can set multiple conditions for fields or supported
  aggregations, along with format options to apply to a target cell. For KPIs and gauge
  charts, you can format the primary value based on conditions that are applied to any
  dimension in the dataset. For gauge charts, you can also format the foreground color of
  the arc based on conditions.

###### To use conditional formatting on a visual

1. On the analysis page, choose the visual that you want to format.
2. On the visual, open the context menu on the down icon at the upper-right. Then
   choose **Conditional formatting**.

Options for formatting display on the left. Choose one of the
following:

    * **For pivot
     tables** – Begin by choosing a measure
     that you want to use. You can set conditional formatting on one or more
     fields. The selection is limited to the measures that are in the
     **Values** field well.
    * **For
     tables** – Begin by choosing a field that
     you want to use. You can set conditional formatting on one or more
     fields. You can also choose to apply formatting to the entire row.
     Formatting the entire row adds an option to **Apply on
     top**, which applies the row formatting in addition to
     formatting added by other conditions.
    * **For
     KPIs** – Apply formatting to the primary
     value or the progress bar or both.

3. For the remaining steps in this procedure, choose the features that you want
