# avgIf

Based on a conditional statement, the `avgIf` function averages the set of
numbers in the specified measure, grouped by the chosen dimension or dimensions. For
example, `avgIf(ProdRev,CalendarDay >= ${BasePeriodStartDate} AND CalendarDay <=
 ${BasePeriodEndDate} AND SourcingType <> 'Indirect')` returns the average
for that measure grouped by the (optional) chosen dimension, if the condition evaluates
to true.

## Syntax

```
avgIf(`dimension or measure, condition`)
```

## Arguments

_decimal_

The argument must be a measure. Null values are omitted from the
