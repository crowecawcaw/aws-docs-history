# max
<a name="max-function"></a>

The `max` function returns the maximum value of the specified measure or date, grouped by the chosen dimension or dimensions. For example, `max(sales goal)` returns the maximum sales goals grouped by the (optional) chosen dimension.

## Syntax
<a name="max-function-syntax"></a>

```
max(measure, [group-by level])
```

## Arguments
<a name="max-function-arguments"></a>

 *measure*   
The argument must be a measure or a date. Null values are omitted from the results. Literal values don't work. The argument must be a field.  
Maximum dates work only in the **Value** field well of tables and pivot tables. 

 *group-by level*   
(Optional) Specifies the level to group the aggregation by. The level added can be any dimension or dimensions independent of the dimensions added to the visual.  
The argument must be a dimension field. The group-by level must be enclosed in square brackets `[ ]`. For more information, see [Level-aware calculation - aggregate (LAC-A) functions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/quicksight/latest/user/level-aware-calculations-aggregate.html).

## Examples
<a name="max-function-example"></a>

The following example returns the max sales value for each region. It is compared to the total, minimum, and median sales values.

```
max({Sales})
```

You can also specify at what level to group the computation using one or more dimensions in the view or in your dataset. This is called a LAC-A function. For more information about LAC-A functions, see [Level-aware calculation - aggregate (LAC-A) functions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/quicksight/latest/user/level-aware-calculations-aggregate.html). The following example calculates the max sales at the Country level, but not across other dimensions (Region) in the visual.

```
max({Sales}, [Country])
```
