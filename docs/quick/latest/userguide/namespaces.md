# Supporting multitenancy with isolated namespaces

Amazon Quick Enterprise edition supports multitenancy through namespaces. An
Amazon Quick _namespace_ is a logical container that you
can use to organize clients, subsidiaries, teams, and so on. Namespaces can help you achieve
the following goals:

- You can allow the users of your Amazon Quick subscription to discover shared
  content and share with other users. At the same time, you can be sure that users in
  one namespace can't see or interact with users in another namespace.
- You can securely isolate data and also support diverse workloads without adding
  additional AWS accounts. Access to data is still strictly controlled by AWS
  security features. Users can see assets (like data and dashboards) only if they have
  the correct resource permissions. Also, users who have permissions can't
  inadvertently expose content to people who outside of their namespace. For more
  information, see [Supporting multitenancy with isolated
  namespaces](../../../quicksight/latest/user/namespaces.md "../../../quicksight/latest/user/namespaces.md").
- You can monitor data flows and usage reports, neatly partitioned by namespace.
  Categorizing data and reports by namespace can help simplify cost and security
  analysis.
- After you've registered users into your namespace, there's no additional
  administrative complexity or overhead.
- Namespaces are designed to span AWS Regions, so the use containment doesn't
  change even if a person signs in to a different AWS Region.
  Namespaces currently have the following limitations:

- Custom namespaces—those that are not the default namespace—are only
  accessible to IAM Federated Single-Sign On users.
- Use default namespaces instead of custom namespaces if you need to support the
  following:
  - Integrating your Amazon Quick account with IAM Identity Center. For more information on
    integrating your Amazon Quick account with IAM Identity Center, see [AWS
    security in Amazon Quick](../../../quicksight/latest/user/security.md "../../../quicksight/latest/user/security.md").
  - Password-based logins.
  - Credential-based Active Directory logins.

- You can't transfer users directly from one namespace to another. You can choose to
  do some or all of this work programmatically. For more information, see the [Quick API reference](../../../quicksight/latest/APIReference/Welcome.md "../../../quicksight/latest/APIReference/Welcome.md"). At the bottom of the page of each API
  operation, there's a list of links to the same operation in the SDKs for other
  languages. To see what SDKs are available, see [SDKs and toolkits](aws.amazon.comgetting-started/tools-sdks.md "aws.amazon.comgetting-started/tools-sdks.md") in the
  [AWS getting started resource
  center](aws.amazon.md "aws.amazon.md").
- Namespaces are useful for isolating users and permissions, but not for sharing
  assets. Dashboards, datasets, and analyses can be shared with users in different
  namespaces. By default, users can't access items that exist in the same
  namespace by default, but gain access to specific assets when the asset is shared
  with them.
  If you don't have an existing AWS account or you need to sign up for Amazon Quick, read
  the following guidelines, then follow the applicable instructions in [Signing up for an Amazon Quick
  subscription](../../../quicksight/latest/user/signing-up.md "../../../quicksight/latest/user/signing-up.md"):

- Sign up for Enterprise edition.
- When asked which method you want to connect with, choose **Role Based
  Federation (IAM)**. Currently, namespaces support only customers who
  use an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role with a web identity federation. For more information,
  see [Creating a role for a third-party Identity Provider (federation)](../../../IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-idp.md "../../../IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-idp.md")
- Complete the process of signing up.
- Use the Amazon Quick [CreateNamespace](../../../quicksight/latest/APIReference/API_CreateNamespace.md "../../../quicksight/latest/APIReference/API_CreateNamespace.md") API operation to create one or more namespaces.
- To start adding users, first follow the instructions in [Setting up IdP federation using IAM and Amazon Quick](../../../quicksight/latest/user/external-identity-providers-setting-up-saml.md "../../../quicksight/latest/user/external-identity-providers-setting-up-saml.md").
  Then use the [RegisterUser](../../../quicksight/latest/APIReference/API_RegisterUser.md "../../../quicksight/latest/APIReference/API_RegisterUser.md") API operation to add users to the appropriate
  namespace.
  If you already signed up for Standard edition, you can easily upgrade your subscription to
  Enterprise edition. The person performing the upgrade must be a Amazon Quick user with
  administrator privileges. For more information, see [Upgrading
  your Amazon Quick subscription](../../../quicksight/latest/user/upgrading-subscription.md "../../../quicksight/latest/user/upgrading-subscription.md").

If you have an Enterprise edition subscription that you've been using for some time, it's
also possible to migrate your users into namespaces. When you sign up for Amazon Quick and
add users, all of them reside in the default namespace. All of the users can interact
directly with each other and share data and dashboards with each other. To isolate your
users from each other, you can create one or more additional namespaces.

###### Important

Amazon Quick assets and resources, including datasets, data sources, dashboards,
analyses, and so on, exist outside of any namespace. They're visible only to users who
have resource permissions granted to them.

To implement namespaces, you use the following Amazon Quick API operations:

- [CreateNamespace](../../../quicksight/latest/APIReference/API_CreateNamespace.md "../../../quicksight/latest/APIReference/API_CreateNamespace.md")
- [DescribeNamespace](../../../quicksight/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeNamespace.md "../../../quicksight/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeNamespace.md")
- [ListNamespaces](../../../quicksight/latest/APIReference/API_ListNamespaces.md "../../../quicksight/latest/APIReference/API_ListNamespaces.md")
- [DeleteNamespace](../../../quicksight/latest/APIReference/API_DeleteNamespace.md "../../../quicksight/latest/APIReference/API_DeleteNamespace.md")
  Namespaces are not supported in the Regions listed below:

- `af-south-1` Africa (Cape Town)
- `ap-southeast-3` Asia Pacific (Jakarta)
- `eu-south-1` Europe (Milan)
- `eu-central-2` Europe (Zurich)

###### Note

If you need to install the AWS CLI, see [Installing the AWS
CLI version 2](../../../cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.md "../../../cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.md") in the _AWS Command Line Interface User Guide._

To add users to a namespace, you use the [RegisterUser](../../../quicksight/latest/APIReference/API_RegisterUser.md "../../../quicksight/latest/APIReference/API_RegisterUser.md") API operation. Each namespace has a completely independent set of
users.
The user ARNs include the namespace qualifier to
distinguish them, as shown in the following examples:

- Amazon Quick considers these two entities to be different persons:
  - `arn:aws:quicksight:us-east-1:111122223333:user/**namespace-123**/username123`
  - `arn:aws:quicksight:us-east-1:111122223333:user/**namespace-456**/username123`

- Amazon Quick considers these two entities to be the same person:

      + `arn:aws:quicksight:**us-east-1**:111122223333:user/**namespace-123**/username123`
      + `arn:aws:quicksight:**us-west-2**:111122223333:user/**namespace-123**/username123`

  When you use [RegisterUser](../../../quicksight/latest/APIReference/API_RegisterUser.md "../../../quicksight/latest/APIReference/API_RegisterUser.md"), you select an access level for each user. After a person's user
  name is assigned to one of the security cohorts, their access to the console and API is
  restricted. People using Amazon Quick can have a single access level, as follows:

- Reader access, for read-only subscribers of a dashboard
- Author access, for analysts and dashboard designers
- Admin access, for Amazon Quick administrators

## To migrate existing users in one namespace to a

different namespace

Follow the procedure below to migrate existing users from one namespace to a different
namespace.

1. Identify the users that you want to transfer to a different namespace by using
   the Amazon Quick user and group API operations. For more information, see [API operations for controlling access](../../../quicksight/latest/APIReference/controlling-access.md#quicksight-groups "../../../quicksight/latest/APIReference/controlling-access.md#quicksight-groups") in the [Quick API reference](../../../quicksight/latest/APIReference/Welcome.md "../../../quicksight/latest/APIReference/Welcome.md").
2. Create users in the new namespace by using the [RegisterUser](../../../quicksight/latest/APIReference/API_RegisterUser.md "../../../quicksight/latest/APIReference/API_RegisterUser.md") API operation. Within
   a namespace, user names are unique.

If a namespace user starts using the Amazon Quick console or API in a new
AWS Region, that user is still constrained to the namespace that you added
them to. Each namespace represents a user directory of an identity provider. As
such, it originates in the primary AWS Region where Amazon Quick is set up.
However, because the user directory is propagated globally in your AWS
account, the namespace is accessible from any AWS Region where your users are
using Amazon Quick. 3. To identify the asset and resource permissions that the new namespace users
need, use the Amazon Quick API operations associated with each type of asset
(dashboards, datasets, and so on). For more information, see [QuickSight API operations to control assets](../../../quicksight/latest/APIReference/qs-assets.md "../../../quicksight/latest/APIReference/qs-assets.md") in the [Quick API reference](../../../quicksight/latest/APIReference/Welcome.md "../../../quicksight/latest/APIReference/Welcome.md").

For example, let's say you are focusing on dashboards. You can use
`ListDashboards` to list all the dashboard IDs in your AWS
account. Then, to determine which users or groups can access these dashboards,
you can use `DescribeDashboardPermissions` on the result set
generated by `ListDashboards`. If you need to identify specific
versions of a dashboard, you can `ListDashboardVersions` for that.
You can also collect information about the location of the data that's used in
the dashboard with the data source and dataset API operations. For more
information, see [QuickSight
API operations to control data resources](../../../quicksight/latest/APIReference/qs-data.md "../../../quicksight/latest/APIReference/qs-data.md") in the [Quick API reference](../../../quicksight/latest/APIReference/Welcome.md "../../../quicksight/latest/APIReference/Welcome.md").

For more information about filtering API response output, see the SDK
documentation for the language you're using. For information relating to the
AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), see [Controlling command output from the AWS CLI](../../../cli/latest/userguide/cli-usage-output.md#cli-usage-output-filter "../../../cli/latest/userguide/cli-usage-output.md#cli-usage-output-filter") in the [AWS Command Line Interface User Guide](../../../cli/latest/userguide.md "../../../cli/latest/userguide.md"). 4. For Amazon Quick assets and resources, copy the permissions that the source
namespace user has for each asset. Then use, for example,
`UpdateDashboardPermissions` to apply the same permissions to the
target namespace user. Each asset type has its own separate set of API
operations for controlling the permissions that users have to use it. For more
information, see [QuickSight API operations for asset and resource permissions](../../../quicksight/latest/APIReference/controlling-access.md#asset-permissions "../../../quicksight/latest/APIReference/controlling-access.md#asset-permissions") in the
[Quick API reference](../../../quicksight/latest/APIReference/Welcome.md "../../../quicksight/latest/APIReference/Welcome.md"). 5. When you are finished adding users and permissions, it's a good practice to
allow some time for user acceptance testing. Doing this ensures that everyone is
successfully using the new namespace. It also ensures that all assets and
resources are accessible in the new namespace.

After you're certain that you no longer need the original user names, you can
begin to deprecate their permissions in the original namespace. Finally, when
the users are ready, you can remove the unused group and user names in the
source namespace. Do this in each AWS Region where your users were previously
active.
