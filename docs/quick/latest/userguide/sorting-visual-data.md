# Sorting visual data in Amazon Quick

You can sort data using multiple methods for most visual types. You can choose the
sort order of on-visual data by using the quick sort option or field wells. You can also
use field wells to sort data by an off-visual metric. The visual element you can sort by
depends on the visual type and whether sorting is supported for that visual. For more
information on which visual types support sorting, see [Analytics formatting per type in
Quick](analytics-format-options.md "analytics-format-options.md").

Pivot tables behave differently than tables when sorting values. For more information
about sorting pivot tables, see [Sorting pivot tables in
Quick](sorting-pivot-tables.md "sorting-pivot-tables.md").

For SPICE datasets, you can sort text strings of sizes up to the
following limitations:

- Up to two million (2,000,000) unique values
- Up to 16 columns
  When you exceed the limitations, the visual displays a notification at the upper
  right.

You can sort any visual type that supports sorting. If a visual type supports sorting,
you can sort by using either the quick sort option or a field well.

###### To quickly sort dimensions and measures

- Do one of the following:
  - Choose the sort icon that appears near the field name on either axis.
    In direct queries, this icon appears for any data type. For
    SPICE, this icon is available only for datetime,
    numeric, and decimal data types.
  - Choose the field name and then choose the sort option from the menu.
    If the label doesn't display on the axis, check the visual format
    to see if the axis is set to display labels. The display labels are
    automatically hidden on smaller visuals. You might need to make the
    visual large enough to display labels.

###### To sort by using an off-visual metric

1. Open the analysis with the visual that you want to sort. Visuals pane will be
   open by default.
2. Choose a field well that supports sorting, then choose **Sort
   by**, **Sort options**.
3. On the **Sort options** pane, sort by specific fields, choose
   an aggregation, or sort ascending or descending, or do a combination of these.
4. Choose **Apply** to save your changes. Or choose
   **Clear** to start over or **Cancel** to
   go back.

###### To sort by using a field well
