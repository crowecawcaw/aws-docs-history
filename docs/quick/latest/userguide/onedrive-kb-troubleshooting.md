## Sign-in errors with user-managed setup
<a name="onedrive-kb-troubleshooting-user-signin"></a>


**User-managed setup sign-in errors**  

| Issue | Cause | Resolution | 
| --- | --- | --- | 
| "Need admin approval" error during sign-in | Your tenant restricts user consent for third-party apps. | Ask a Global Administrator to grant admin consent. For more information, see [Admin consent for Microsoft 365](onedrive-kb-user-managed.md#onedrive-kb-user-admin-consent). | 
| Sign-in window closes without completing | Browser popup blocker or cookie settings. | Allow popups from the Amazon Quick domain and ensure third-party cookies are enabled. | 
| "AADSTS65004: User declined to consent" | User chose Cancel or Deny on the consent dialog. | Retry the sign-in and choose Accept on the consent dialog. | 

## Token refresh with user-managed setup
<a name="onedrive-kb-troubleshooting-token-refresh"></a>

User-managed setup uses the `offline_access` scope to obtain refresh tokens. Delegated credentials last approximately 90 days. If the refresh token expires or is revoked (for example, by a password change, session revocation, or admin action), syncs fail and you need to re-authenticate.

To re-authenticate:

1. Navigate to the **Knowledge bases** list page in Amazon Quick.

1. Locate the knowledge base that requires a refresh. In the **Actions** column, choose the three-dot menu and choose **Edit integration**.

1. The **Edit integration** dialog opens. You can optionally update the integration name.

1. Choose **Save and Reauthenticate**.

1. A Microsoft sign-in window opens. Complete the sign-in flow using the same credentials that were originally used to create the integration.

**Important**  
When you re-authenticate, sign in using the same Microsoft 365 account that was used during the original setup. Using different credentials might cause issues with connected resources. The new account might have different OneDrive permissions than the original account.

**Common OneDrive knowledge base errors**  

| Issue | Cause | Resolution | 
| --- | --- | --- | 
| Unable to access KMS key | The KMS key ARN is incorrect, the key does not exist in the specified Region, or the KMS key has not been added in the Amazon Quick admin console. | Verify the KMS key ARN and Region. Confirm the KMS key has been added under Manage account, AWS resources, AWS Key Management Service. Confirm the key is enabled and has not been scheduled for deletion. Multi-Region keys are not supported. | 
| Invalid Tenant ID | The Tenant ID is malformed or does not match a valid Entra tenant. | Copy the Tenant ID directly from the Entra admin center: Microsoft Entra ID, Overview. | 
| Invalid Client ID | The Client ID is incorrect or the app registration does not exist. | Copy the Application (Client) ID from App Registrations, your app, Overview. | 
| Certificate validation failed | The thumbprint does not match the certificate in Entra, or the certificate has expired. | Verify the thumbprint using the base64url-encoded SHA-1 value from the certificate generation step. Ensure the certificate has not expired. | 
| Unable to connect to OneDrive | One or more credentials are incorrect, or the Entra app is missing required API permissions or admin consent. | Review all field values. Confirm the Entra app has the correct API permissions and that admin consent has been granted. | 
| Error loading the file picker with user-managed setup | The file picker is unable to establish a connection to OneDrive on behalf of the signed-in user. | Close the error message and choose Add content again to retry. If the error persists, close the creation dialog, reopen the flow, and sign in to OneDrive again. | 

## Check document access (ACL verification)
<a name="onedrive-kb-troubleshooting-acl"></a>

Admin-managed OneDrive knowledge bases always enforce document-level access control. You can verify document-level access control for individual items using the Permission Checker in sync reports. For detailed instructions, see [Check document access (ACL verification)](sync-reports-observability.md#sync-reports-acl-verification).

## Sync monitoring and reports

For detailed information about sync schedules, sync activity, sync reports, filtering items, and downloading reports, see [Sync reports and observability](sync-reports-observability.md).

**Tip**  
To trigger a sync on demand, choose **Sync now** on the knowledge base detail page.

After you resolve the issue, verify your fix by running a sync. For more information about sync monitoring, see [Sync reports and observability](sync-reports-observability.md).
