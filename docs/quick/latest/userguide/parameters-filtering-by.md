# Using filters with parameters in

Amazon Quick

Use this section to filter the data in an analysis or dashboard by a single-value
parameter value. To use a multivalued parameter—one with a multiselect
drop-down control—create a custom filter that is equal (or not equal) to the
values.

Before using a filter with a parameter, you should already know how to work with
filters.

1. Verify that your analysis has a parameter already created. Choose
   **Edit** from either the parameter or the control menu
   to find out what settings are in use.
2. Choose the **Filter** pane from the left of the screen.
   If there is already a filter for the field that you want to use, choose it
   to open its settings. Otherwise, create a filter for the field that you want
   to filter by parameter.
3. Choose **Use Parameters**.
4. Choose your parameters from the list or lists below **Use
   parameters**. For text (string) fields, first choose
   **Custom Filter**, and then enable **Use
   Parameters**.

For date fields, choose the **Start date** and
**End date** parameters, as shown in the following
screenshot.

For fields with other data types, choose **Select a
parameter** and then choose your parameter from the list.

###### Note

Parameters that can hold multiple values must use equal or not equal
as the comparison type. 5. Choose **Apply** to save your changes.
Test your new filter by choosing the control near the top of the analysis. In this
example, we use a basic parameter that has no defaults, and a dynamic control that
is linked to the **Region** field in the sample dataset named
**Sales Pipeline**. The control queries the data, returning all
values.

If you delete or recreate a parameter that you are using in a filter, you can
update the filter with the new parameter. To do this, open the filter, choose the
new parameter that you want to use, and then choose
**Apply**.

If you rename a parameter, you don't need to update the filter or any other
consumers.
