# Different editions of Amazon Quick

Amazon Quick offers Standard and Enterprise editions. Both editions offer a full set of
features for creating and sharing data visualizations. Enterprise edition additionally
offers encryption at rest and Microsoft Active Directory integration. In Enterprise edition,
you select a Microsoft Active Directory directory in Directory Service. You use that active directory to
identify and manage your Quick users and administrators.

For more information about the different features offered by the Quick
editions and about pricing, see [Amazon Quick pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/quicksuite/pricing/ "https://aws.amazon.com/quicksuite/pricing/").

## Availability of editions

All editions are available in any AWS Region that is currently supported by
Amazon Quick.

The capacity region in which you start your Amazon Quick subscription is where your
account's default [SPICE](../../../quicksight/latest/user/spice.md "../../../quicksight/latest/user/spice.md") capacity is allocated. However, you can purchase additional
SPICE capacity and access your AWS resources in any other supported
AWS Region.

New Amazon Quick features are not available in the Standard edition. If you are an
existing customer on the Standard edition, you can upgrade to Enterprise edition and
provision appropriate roles to access Amazon Quick features.

To manage Enterprise account settings, you must temporarily change your region for
your session to US East (N. Virginia) Region. You can change it back when you have
finished editing your account settings. These settings include changing your
subscription's notification email, enabling IAM access requests, editing access to AWS
resources, and unsubscribing from Amazon Quick.

## User management between editions

User management is different between the Amazon Quick Standard and Enterprise
editions. However, both editions support identity federation, or Federated Single
Sign-On (IAM Identity Center), through Security Assertion Markup Language 2.0 (SAML 2.0).

### User management for standard

edition

In the Standard edition, as a system administrator, you can invite an AWS Identity and Access Management
user and allow that user to use their credentials to access Amazon Quick.
Alternatively, you can invite any person with an email address to create an
Amazon Quick–only account. When you create a Amazon Quick user account,
Amazon Quick sends an email to that user inviting them to activate their
account.

When you create a Amazon Quick user account, you also choose to assign it either
an administrative or a user role. This role assignment determines the user's
permissions in Amazon Quick. You perform all management of users by adding,
changing, and deleting accounts in Amazon Quick.

### User management for enterprise

edition

In the Enterprise edition, as a system administrator, you can select one or more
IAM Identity Center or Microsoft Active Directory groups for administrative access. All users in
these groups are authorized to sign in to Amazon Quick as Amazon Quick
administrators. You can also select one or more IAM Identity Center or Microsoft
Active Directory groups in Directory Service for user access. All users in these groups are
authorized to sign in to Amazon Quick as users.

###### Important

With IAM Identity Center, share the AWS sign in portal with end users to access
Amazon Quick. For more information, see [Sign in to the AWS access portal](../../../signin/latest/userguide/iam-id-center-sign-in-tutorial.md "../../../signin/latest/userguide/iam-id-center-sign-in-tutorial.md").

With Active Directory, Amazon Quick Administrators and users aren't
automatically notified of their access to Amazon Quick. You must email users
with the sign-in URL, the account name, and their credentials.

You can only add or remove Enterprise edition accounts by adding or removing a
person from the IAM Identity Center or Microsoft Active Directory group that you
associated with Amazon Quick. When you add a Amazon Quick user account, its
permissions depend on whether the IAM Identity Center or Microsoft Active Directory group is an
administrative group or a user group in Amazon Quick.

To remove a user's access to Amazon Quick, remove the user from an IAM Identity Center or
Microsoft Active Directory group or remove their IAM Identity Center or Microsoft Active Directory
group from an associated role in Amazon Quick.

## Permissions for the different editions

In the Standard edition, all Amazon Quick administrators can manage subscriptions and
SPICE capacity. They can also add, modify, and delete accounts.

Additional IAM permissions are required to manage Amazon Quick permissions to AWS
resources and to unsubscribe from Amazon Quick. These tasks can only be performed by an
IAM user who also has administrative permissions in Amazon Quick, or by the IAM user
or AWS account (system administrator) that created the Amazon Quick account.

To manage access to AWS resources from Amazon Quick, you must be logged in as one of
the following:

- Any IAM user who is an Amazon Quick administrator
- The IAM user or AWS root account that created the Amazon Quick account
  (system administrator)

All IAM Identity Center or Microsoft Active Directory users that are Amazon Quick administrators can
manage subscriptions and SPICE capacity.

Additional IAM permissions are required to manage access to AWS resources or to
unsubscribe from Amazon Quick. Administrators need to sign in with IAM permissions to
perform these tasks.

For more information on admin user permissions, see [Amazon Quick
user types](../../../quicksuite/latest/userguide/user-types.md "../../../quicksuite/latest/userguide/user-types.md").
