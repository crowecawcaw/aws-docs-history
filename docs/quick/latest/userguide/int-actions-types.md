# Types of actions

Amazon Quick supports two methods of invoking actions, each serving different use cases and authentication models.

## On-demand actions

On-demand actions execute immediately when you trigger them. These actions support interactive operations that require real-time response.

**Key characteristics:**

- User-initiated execution - You trigger actions through natural language in the chat interface.
- Interactive form completion - You fill out forms with required parameters before the action executes.
- Immediate response - Actions execute in real-time and provide instant feedback on success or failure.
- Personal authentication (3LO) - Uses your individual credentials and permissions from the target service.

**Common use cases:**

- Creating tickets in Jira.
- Sending messages in Slack.
- Updating Salesforce records.
- Retrieving information from SharePoint.

## Automated workflows

Automated workflows execute actions on a schedule or in response to specific triggers. These are useful for background and system-level operations.

**Key characteristics:**

- System-level execution - Actions run automatically without user intervention based on predefined triggers.
- Scheduled or event-triggered - Execute on time-based schedules or in response to specific system events.
- Non-interactive operation - Run in the background without requiring user input or form completion.
- Service-level authentication - Use system credentials rather than individual user authentication.

**Common use cases:**

- Regular data synchronization.
- Scheduled report generation.
- Automated ticket updates.
- System health checks.
