# Amazon Quick JSON expression language for

Highcharts visuals

Highcharts visuals accept most [valid JSON
values](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_json_datatypes.asp "https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_json_datatypes.asp"), standard arithmetic operators, string operators, and conditional
operators. The following JSON values are not supported for Highcharts
visuals:

- Functions
- Dates
- Undefined values
  Quick authors can use JSON expression language create JSON schemas for
  a highcharts visual. JSON expression language is used to bind JSON to APIs or
  datasets to allow dynamic population and modification of JSON structures. Developers
  can also use JSON expression language to inflate and transform JSON data with
  concise and intuitive expressions.

With JSON expression language, expressions are represented as arrays, where the
first element specifies the operation and subsequent elements are the arguments. For
example, `["unique", [1, 2, 2]]` applies the `unique`
operation to the array `[1, 2, 2]`, resulting in `[1, 2]`.
This array-based syntax allows for flexible expressions, that allow complex
transformations on JSON data.

JSON expression language supports _nested expressions_. Nested
expressions are expressions that contain other expressions as arguments. For example
`["split", ["toUpper", "hello world"], " "]` first converts the
string `hello world` into an uppercase, then splits it into array of
words, resulting in `["HELLO", "WORLD"]`.
