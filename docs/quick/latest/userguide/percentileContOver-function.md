# percentileContOver
<a name="percentileContOver-function"></a>

The `percentileContOver` function calculates the percentile based on the actual numbers in `measure`. It uses the grouping and sorting that are applied in the field wells. The result is partitioned by the specified dimension at the specified calculation level. 

Use this function to answer the following question: Which actual data points are present in this percentile? To return the nearest percentile value that is present in your dataset, use `percentileDiscOver`. To return an exact percentile value that might not be present in your dataset, use `percentileContOver` instead. 

## Syntax
<a name="percentileContOver-function-syntax"></a>

```
percentileContOver (
    {{measure}}
  , {{percentile-n}}
  , [{{partition-by, …}}]
  , {{calculation-level}}
)
```

## Arguments
<a name="percentileContOver-function-arguments"></a>

 *measure*   
Specifies a numeric value to use to compute the percentile. The argument must be a measure or metric. Nulls are ignored in the calculation. 

 *percentile-n*   
The percentile value can be any numeric constant 0–100. A percentile value of 50 computes the median value of the measure. 

 *partition-by*   
(Optional) One or more dimensions that you want to partition by, separated by commas. Each field in the list is enclosed in { } (curly braces), if it is more than one word. The entire list is enclosed in [ ] (square brackets).

 *calculation-level*   
 Specifies where to perform the calculation in relation to the order of evaluation. There are three supported calculation levels:  
+ PRE\_FILTER
+ PRE\_AGG
+ POST\_AGG\_FILTER (default) – To use this calculation level, specify an aggregation on `measure`, for example `sum(measure)`.
PRE\_FILTER and PRE\_AGG are applied before the aggregation occurs in a visualization. For these two calculation levels, you can't specify an aggregation on `measure` in the calculated field expression. To learn more about calculation levels and when they apply, see [Order of evaluation in Amazon Quick](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/quicksight/latest/user/order-of-evaluation-quicksight.html) and [Using level-aware calculations in Quick](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/quicksight/latest/user/level-aware-calculations.html).

## Returns
<a name="percentileContOver-function-return-type"></a>

The result of the function is a number. 

## Example of percentileContOver

The following example helps explain how percentileContOver works.

**Example Comparing calculation levels for the median**  
The following example shows the median for a dimension (category) by using different calculation levels with the `percentileContOver` function. The percentile is 50. The dataset is filtered by a region field. The code for each calculated field is as follows:  
+ `example = left( {{category}}, 1 )` (A simplified example.)
+ `pre_agg = percentileContOver ( {Revenue} , 50 , [ example ] , PRE_AGG)`
+ `pre_filter = percentileContOver ( {Revenue} , 50 , [ example ] , PRE_FILTER) `
+ `post_agg_filter = percentileContOver ( sum ( {Revenue} ) , 50 , [ example ], POST_AGG_FILTER )`

```
