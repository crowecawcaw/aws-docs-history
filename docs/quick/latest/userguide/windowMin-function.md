# windowMin

The `windowMin` function calculates the minimum of the aggregated measure
in a custom window that is partitioned and sorted by specified attributes. Usually, you
use custom window functions on a time series, where your visual shows a metric and a
date field. You can use `windowMin` to help you identify the minimum of the
metric over a period time.

Window functions aren't supported for MySQL versions earlier than 8 and MariaDB
versions earlier than 10.2.

## Syntax

The brackets are required. To see which arguments are optional, see the following
descriptions.

```
windowMin
	(
	     `measure`
            , `[sort_order_field ASC/DESC, ...]`
            , `start_index`
            , `end_index`
	     ,`[ partition_field, ... ]`
	)
```

## Arguments

_measure_

The aggregated metric that you want to get the average for, for
example `sum({Revenue})`.

_sort attribute_

One or more aggregated fields, either measures or dimensions or both,
that you want to sort the data by, separated by commas. You can either
specify ascending (`ASC`) or descending
(`DESC`) sort order.

Each field in the list is enclosed in {} (curly braces), if it's
more than one word. The entire list is enclosed in [ ] (square
brackets).

_start index_

The start index is a positive integer, indicating _n_ rows above the current row. The start
index counts the available data points above the current row, rather
than counting actual time periods. If your data is sparse (missing
months or years, for example), adjust the indexes accordingly.

_end index_

The end index is a positive integer, indicating _n_ rows below the current row. The end index
counts the available data points below the current row, rather than
counting actual time periods. If your data is sparse (missing months or
years, for example), adjust the indexes accordingly.

_partition field_

(Optional) One or more dimensions that you want to partition by,
separated by commas.

Each field in the list is enclosed in {} (curly braces), if it's
more than one word. The entire list is enclosed in [ ] (square
brackets).

## Example

The following example calculates the trailing 12-month minimum of
`sum(Revenue)`, partitioned by `SaleDate`. The calculation
includes 12 rows above and 0 row below of the current row.

```
windowMin
	(
	     sum(Revenue),
	     [SaleDate ASC],
	     12,
               0
	)
```

The following screenshot shows the results of this trailing 12-month example. The
sum(Revenue) field is added to the chart to show the difference between the revenue
and the trailing 12-month minimum revenue.
