## Overview
<a name="web-browser-overview"></a>

Browser actions provide a comprehensive automation toolkit for performing web interactions. Browser sessions are automatically managed — opened, maintained, and closed as needed. Quick Automate supports flexible element identification through AI-powered natural language descriptions and precise XPath selectors. Key capabilities include intelligent element targeting with fallback mechanisms, self-healing features that automatically handle popups and retry failed actions, data extraction including structured table content, and a full suite of interaction methods from basic clicks and typing to advanced AI-driven multi-step tasks.

**Element identification methods**
+ **Description method:** Uses AI to identify elements using natural language descriptions (e.g., "Log In button"), making automations more resilient to UI changes.
+ **XPath selector method:** Uses precise XPath expressions for exact element targeting (e.g., `//button[text()='Log in']`).
+ **Combined approach:** When both methods are enabled, XPath is tried first before falling back to the description method, combining precision with adaptability.

**Self-Healing features available for type-ins and clicks**
+ **HandlePopups:** Automatically detects and handles unexpected dialogs, cookie notices, and overlays, preventing blocking elements from interrupting workflows.
+ **ValidateAndRetry:** Verifies action success through screenshot comparison and retries if needed, reducing false failures.

## Browser Session Management
<a name="browser-session-management"></a>

Browser instances are automatically created, maintained throughout workflows, and properly cleaned up when complete. The `restart_browser` action allows fresh sessions when needed for scenarios such as login timeouts or session expiration.

## Start Browser Session

**Note**  
All browser actions must be placed within a browser session scope
Each browser scope is a browser session. Browser automatically closes when actions inside a scope completes.

## Limitations
<a name="web-browser-limitations"></a>

**Element Identification Uncertainty**: If the AI cannot reliably identify UI elements, actions fail with 'LowConfidence' errors. In these cases, use more specific XPath selectors or element descriptions. **Browser Compatibility**: The system operates exclusively with Chrome browser instances and utilizes Playwright as the underlying automation framework, which means compatibility is limited to Chrome-supported web technologies and may not work with browser-specific features from other vendors. **Dynamic Content Challenges**: Highly dynamic pages with frequent layout changes, heavy JavaScript frameworks, or complex single-page applications may require additional wait times, retry logic, or specialized handling approaches. **Performance Overhead**: AI-powered features like natural language element targeting and self-healing capabilities require more processing time than direct XPath targeting.
