<a name="vpc-amazon-virtual-private-cloud"></a>

A *virtual private cloud (VPC)* is a virtual network dedicated to your AWS account. The Amazon VPC service that provides it is a networking layer for your AWS resources. Using Amazon VPC, you can define a virtual network in your own logically isolated area within the AWS Cloud. A VPC closely resembles a traditional network that you might operate in your own data center, with the benefits of using the AWS scalable infrastructure. Amazon VPC for Amazon EC2 virtual computing environments, known as *instances*, can be used for a variety of AWS resources. 

VPCs offer options that allow for flexibility in a secure environment, for example:
+ To configure your VPC, you can set its IP address range, create subnets, configure route tables, network gateways, network interfaces, and security settings.
+ To make the AWS Cloud an extension of your data center, you can connect your VPC to your own corporate data center.
+ You can connect your instances in the VPC to the internet, or keep your instances isolated on a private network.
+ To protect the resources in each subnet, you can use multiple layers of security, including security groups and network access control lists (ACLs). 

For more information, see the [Amazon VPC User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/what-is-amazon-vpc.html). 

If you have a default VPC and don't specify a subnet when you launch an instance, the instance is launched into your default VPC. You can launch instances into your default VPC without needing to know anything about Amazon VPC. 

If you don't already have a VPC or want to use a new one, you can create one by following the instructions in [Getting started with Amazon VPC](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-getting-started.html) in the *Amazon VPC User Guide*. This section offers guidance on how to set up your VPC. The guidance includes options for public and private subnets and for AWS Site-to-Site VPN access for your corporate network (known as *on-premises access*). You can also use VPC peering or Direct Connect to reach an on-premises database instance. 

**Using the AWS CLI**

You can start to set up a VPC in Amazon EC2 by using the [`aws ec2 create-vpc`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/create-vpc.html) command. To learn more about VPC settings for the AWS CLI, see [Examples for VPC](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_Scenarios.html) in the *Amazon VPC User Guide*.

**Using the Amazon EC2 console**

To view your VPC or create a new one in Amazon EC2, sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon VPC console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/). To create a new VPC, choose **Launch VPC Wizard** and follow the instructions. Note your new VPC ID for future reference. To view VPCs, choose **Your VPCs** on the left side.
