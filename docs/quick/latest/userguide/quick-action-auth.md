# Authentication methods

Amazon Quick supports multiple authentication methods for connectors. The available methods depend on the specific connector. During setup, you choose your authentication method from the **OAuth Configuration** options or from the connector-specific authentication settings.

## Default OAuth app

Default OAuth app (also known as managed authentication or 3LO) is the
recommended authentication method for personal access to third-party
services. With this method, Amazon Quick manages the OAuth flow and no
additional credentials are required from your organization.

**Key features:**

- No additional credentials or configuration required.
- User-specific authentication through provider sign-in.
- Secure credential storage managed by Amazon Quick.
- Automatic token refresh.
- 90-day refresh token lifecycle.

**Setup process:**

1. Choose **Default OAuth app** as your OAuth
   configuration.
2. Complete the service provider sign-in flow.
3. Grant the requested permissions.
4. Confirm the connection.

###### Note

Not all connectors support Default OAuth app. Check the
connector-specific documentation for available authentication
methods.

## Custom OAuth app

Custom OAuth app authentication is for organizations that require
specific control over the OAuth application configuration. Like Default
OAuth app, this method uses a three-legged OAuth (3LO) flow where users
sign in directly with the service provider. The difference is that you
provide your own OAuth credentials instead of using the Amazon Quick
managed application.

**Required information:**

- Client ID
- Client Secret
- Domain URL
- Authorization URL
- Token URL
- Redirect URL

**Setup process:**

1. Create an OAuth application in your service provider's developer
   console.
2. Choose **Custom OAuth app** as your OAuth
   configuration.
3. Enter the credentials from your OAuth application.
4. Complete the sign-in flow and validate the connection.

## Service-to-Service OAuth

Service-to-Service OAuth uses client credentials for server-to-server
authentication without user interaction. This method is suitable for
automated workflows and shared connectors where actions run under a
service account.

**Required information:**

- Client ID
- Client Secret
- Domain URL
- Token URL
- Service-specific parameters (varies by connector)

## API key authentication

Some connectors support API key authentication for service-level
access. This method uses a single token for authentication and is
common for connectors that don't support OAuth.

**Required information:**

- Valid API key from the service provider
- Base URL or domain
- Service-specific parameters (such as email or account ID)
