# Creating a pivot table

Use the following procedure to create a pivot table.

###### To create a pivot table

1. On the analysis page, choose the **Visualize** icon on
   the tool bar.
2. On the **Visuals** pane, choose **+
   Add**, and then choose the pivot table icon.
3. From the **Fields list** pane, choose the fields that you
   want to include. Amazon Quick automatically places these into the field
   wells.

To change the placement of a field, drag it to the appropriate field
wells. Typically, you use dimension or measure fields as indicated by the
target field well. If you choose to use a dimension field as a measure, the
**Count** aggregate function is automatically applied
to it to create a numeric value.

    * To create a single-measure pivot table, drag a dimension to the
     **Rows** field well, a dimension to the
     **Columns** field well, and a measure to the
     **Values** field well.
    * To create a multi-measure pivot table, drag a dimension to the
     **Rows** field well, a dimension to the
     **Columns** field well, and two or more
     measures to the **Values** field well.
    * To create a clustered pivot table, drag one or more dimensions to
     the **Rows** field well, one or more dimensions to
     the **Columns** field well, and a measure to the
     **Values** field well.

You can also select multiple fields for all of the pivot table field wells
if you want to. Doing this combines the multi-measure and clustered pivot
table approaches.

###### Note

To view roll-ups for calculated fields, make sure that you are using
aggregates. For example, a calculated field with `field-1 / field-2` doesn't display a summary when rolled up. However,
`sum(field-1) / sum(field-2)` does display a roll-up summary.

## Choosing a layout

When you create a pivot table in Amazon Quick, you can further customize the
way your data is presented with Tabular and Hierarchy layout options. For pivot
tables that use a tabular layout, each row field is displayed in its own column.
For pivot tables that use a hierarchy layout, all row fields are displayed in a
single column. Indentation is used to differentiate row headers of different
fields. To change the layout of a pivot table visual, open the **Format
visual** menu of the pivot table that you want to change and choose
the layout option that you want from the **Pivot options**
section.

Depending on the layout that you choose for your pivot table visual, different
formatting options are available. For more information about formatting
differences between tabular and hierarchy pivot tables, see [Table and pivot table formatting options in
Quick](format-tables-pivot-tables.md "format-tables-pivot-tables.md").
