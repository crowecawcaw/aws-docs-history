# lead
<a name="lead-function"></a>

The `lead` function calculates the lead (following) value for a measure based on specified partitions and sorts.

## Syntax
<a name="lead-function-syntax"></a>

The brackets are required. To see which arguments are optional, see the following descriptions.

```
lead
(
{{     measure
     ,[ sortorder_field ASC_or_DESC, ... ]  
     ,lookup_index,
     ,[ partition_field, ... ]}}
)
```

## Arguments
<a name="lead-function-arguments"></a>

*measure*   
The measure that you want to get the lead for. This can include an aggregate, for example `sum({Sales Amt})`.

*sort order field*   
One or more measures and dimensions that you want to sort the data by, separated by commas. You can specify either ascending (**ASC**) or descending (**DESC**) sort order.   
Each field in the list is enclosed in {} (curly braces), if it is more than one word. The entire list is enclosed in [ ] (square brackets).

*lookup index*   
The lookup index can be positive or negative, indicating a following row in the sort (positive) or a previous row in the sort (negative). The lookup index can be 1–2,147,483,647. For the engines MySQL, MariaDB, and Amazon Aurora MySQL-Compatible Edition, the lookup index is limited to just 1.

 *partition field*   
(Optional) One or more dimensions that you want to partition by, separated by commas.   
Each field in the list is enclosed in {} (curly braces), if it is more than one word. The entire list is enclosed in [ ] (square brackets).

## Example
<a name="lead-function-example"></a>

The following example calculates the next `sum(sales)`, partitioned by the state of origin, in the ascending sort order on `cancellation_code`.

```
lead
(
     sum(sales), 
     [cancellation_code ASC], 
     1, 
     [origin_state_nm]
)
```

The following example uses a calculated field with lead to display the amount for the next row beside the amount for the current row, sorted by `Customer Segment`. The fields in the table calculation are in the field wells of the visual.

```
lead(
     sum({Billed Amount}),
     [{Customer Segment} ASC],
     1
)
```

The following screenshot shows the results of the example.
