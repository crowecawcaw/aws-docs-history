## Table calculations
<a name="table-calculations"></a>

Table calculations form a group of functions that provide context in an analysis. They provide support for enriched aggregated analysis. By using these calculations, you can address common business scenarios such as calculating percentage of total, running sum, difference, common baseline, and rank. 

When you are analyzing data in a specific visual, you can apply table calculations to the current set of data to discover how dimensions influence measures or each other. Visualized data is your result set based on your current dataset, with all the filters, field selections, and customizations applied. To see exactly what this result set is, you can export your visual to a file. A table calculation function performs operations on the data to reveal relationships between fields.
