# Using custom actions for filtering and

navigating

To add interactive options for dashboard subscribers (Quick readers), you
create custom actions on one or more visuals in your analysis. Enhancing dashboards with
custom actions helps people explore data by adding more context from within the dataset.
It can make it easier to drill into the details and to find new insights in the same
dashboard, a different dashboard, or a different application. You can add up to 10
custom actions to each visual in a dashboard.

Before you begin, it's helpful to do some planning. For example, identify fields that
are good candidates for filtering, for opening a different sheet, for opening a URL, or
for sending email. For each sheet, identify the widgets that display these fields. Then
decide which widgets are going to contain actions. It's also a good idea to create a
naming scheme so the names of the actions are consistent throughout the entire analysis.
Consistent names make it easier for the person using your analysis to figure out what
the action will do, plus they make it easier for you to maintain actions that you might
be duplicating throughout the analysis.

Actions only exist on the dashboard widget where you create them and they work in the
context of that widget's parent sheet and child fields that it displays. You can create
actions only on specific types of widget: visuals and insights. You can't add them to
other widgets, for example filter or list controls. Custom actions can only be activated
from the widget where you create them.

To activate an action, the person using the analysis can left-click (select) or
right-click (use the context menu) on a data point. A _data
point_ is an item in the dataset, for example a point on a line chart, a
cell in a pivot table, a slice on a pie chart, and so on. If the person clicks a visual
element, the _select_ action is activated. This is the
action that is currently a member of the **On select** category of the
**Actions** in an analysis. If the person instead right-clicks a
visual element, they can choose from a list of _menu_
actions. Any action listed is currently a member of the **Menu option**
category of the **Actions** in an analysis. The **On
select** category can contain one and only one member action.

By default, the first action you create becomes the select action—the one
activated by left-clicking. To remove an action from the **On select**
category, change the action's **Activation** setting to **Menu
option**. After you save that change, you can set a different action's
**Activation** setting to **Select**.

You can choose from three **Action types** when you configure an
action:

- **Filter action** – Filter data included
  in visual or in the entire sheet. By default, filters are available for all
  fields in the parent visual. Cascading filters are enabled by default. Filter
  actions work across multiple datasets by using automatically generated field
  mappings.

If the analysis uses more than one dataset, you can view the automatically
generated field mappings for fields that exist in multiple datasets. To do this,
choose **View field
mapping** at the end of the action settings, while
you're editing an action. If you are viewing a list of actions, choose
**View field
mapping** from the menu for each action. The field
mappings appear in a new screen that shows the mapping between the initial
dataset and all the other datasets in the visual. If no fields are automatically
mapped, a message displays with a link to [Mapping and Joining Fields](mapping-and-joining-fields.md "mapping-and-joining-fields.md").

- **Navigation actions** – Enable navigation
  between different sheets in the same analysis.
- **URL actions** – Open a link to another
  web page. If you want to open a different dashboard, use a URL action. You can
  use a URL action to send data points and parameters to other URLs. You can
  include any available field or parameter.

If the URL uses the `mailto` scheme, running the action opens your
default email editor.
