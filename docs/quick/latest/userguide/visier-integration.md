# Visier integration

###### Note

This guide covers an integration validated with a third-party MCP server.
Visier manages the setup and availability of the MCP server.

With the Visier integration in Amazon Quick, you can access Visier's people
analytics platform directly through Model Context Protocol (MCP) server connectivity.
You can query live workforce data, analyze headcount trends, assess retention health,
generate workforce briefings, and more without leaving Amazon Quick.

Visier is available as an MCP-based connector in Amazon Quick. To set up this
integration, complete the following two steps. First, prepare your Visier account
with the required API access and MCP server configuration. Then, create the
integration in Amazon Quick and authenticate with your Visier credentials.

## Prerequisites

Before you set up the integration, make sure that you have the following
resources and access.

- An active Visier account with API access and MCP server enabled. For
  information about enabling the MCP server and configuring authentication,
  see [Visier MCP Server documentation](https://docs.visier.com/developer/agents/mcp/mcp-server-set-up.htm "https://docs.visier.com/developer/agents/mcp/mcp-server-set-up.htm").
- Appropriate data access scopes configured in your Visier account for
  the workforce data you want to query.
- For information about subscription requirements, see [Set up integrations in the console](integration-console-setup-process.md "integration-console-setup-process.md").

## Verify your Visier account

Before you configure Amazon Quick, verify that your Visier account meets the
following requirements.

- Your Visier account is active and you can sign in to your Visier
  environment.
- You enabled the MCP Server capability in your Visier admin console under
  **Settings**, **API &
  Integrations**.
- The workforce data and analytics you want to query are accessible to
  your account.

## Set up the integration in Amazon Quick

After you verify your Visier account access, create the integration in
Amazon Quick. The setup wizard has four steps: Connect, Authenticate, Review,
and Share integration.

### Connect

1. In the Amazon Quick console, choose
   **Connectors**.
2. Choose the **Create for your team** tab.
3. Find and choose **Model Context Protocol
   (MCP)**.
4. On the **Create integration** page, enter the
   following fields:
   - **Name** – A descriptive name for your
     Visier integration.
   - **Description** (Optional) – Notes about
     how you plan to use this connection.
   - **MCP server endpoint** – The MCP server
     endpoint URL from your Visier admin console.
   - **Connection type** – Choose
     **Public network**.

5. Choose **Next**.

### Authenticate

1.  Under **Authentication settings**, enter the
    OAuth credentials from your Visier MCP server
    configuration:

        * **Client ID** – The OAuth client
         ID.
        * **Client secret** – The OAuth client
         secret.
        * **Token URL** – The OAuth token
         endpoint.
        * **Authorization URL** – The OAuth
         authorization endpoint.

    Amazon Quick pre-fills the **Redirect URL**.

2.  Choose **Create and continue**.
3.  In the Visier sign-in popup that appears, enter your Visier
    credentials and choose **Sign in** to authorize
    Amazon Quick to access Visier on your behalf.

### Review

1. On the **Review** page, Amazon Quick discovers
   the tools exposed by the Visier MCP server and displays them in a
   table. Review the list of available actions to confirm that the
   expected tools are present.
2. Choose **Next**.

### Share integration

1. (Optional) On the **Share integration** page,
   search for teams or groups to share the integration with.
2. Choose **Done**.

The integration appears in the **Existing actions** panel with
a status of **Available**.

## Available actions

After you set up the integration, you can use the following actions. The Visier
MCP server exposes its people analytics capabilities as callable tools.

| Visier available actions                | Action                                                                                                         | Description |

## Manage and troubleshoot

To edit, share, or delete your integration, see [Managing existing integrations](integration-workflows.md#managing-existing-integrations "integration-workflows.md#managing-existing-integrations").

### Authentication issues

- **MCP server connection fails** –
  Verify that you enabled the MCP Server capability in your Visier admin
  console under **Settings**, **API &
  Integrations**. Confirm that you entered the endpoint URL and credentials
  correctly in Amazon Quick.
- **Data access errors** – Verify that
  the data access scopes configured in your Visier account include the
  workforce data you are trying to query. Contact your Visier
  administrator to review your account permissions.
- **No tools discovered** – If
  Amazon Quick does not discover any tools after you enter the MCP
  server URL, confirm that the MCP server is active. Also verify that your
  authentication credentials have not expired.
