# Microsoft OneDrive action integration
<a name="onedrive-action-integration"></a>

Use the Microsoft OneDrive connector to manage OneDrive files, folders, and Excel workbooks directly in Amazon Quick through natural language.

Amazon Quick supports multiple authentication methods for Microsoft OneDrive. Choose the method that best fits your organization's security requirements.
+ **Default OAuth app** – Uses an AWS-managed OAuth application. No additional credentials are needed. Users authenticate directly with their Microsoft account.
+ **Custom OAuth app** – Uses a customer-managed application registered in Microsoft Entra. This option gives your organization full control over the OAuth configuration. Users authenticate on behalf of a signed-in user (delegated permissions).
+ **Service-to-Service OAuth** – Uses client credentials for server-to-server authentication without user interaction (application permissions). Suitable for automated workflows.

For more information about the authentication methods that Amazon Quick supports, see [Authentication methods](quick-action-auth.md).

## Before you begin
<a name="onedrive-action-prerequisites"></a>

Make sure you have the following before you set up the integration.
+ A Microsoft 365 account with OneDrive access.
+ For **Custom OAuth app** or **Service-to-Service OAuth**: Access to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com/) on the Microsoft website with at least Application Developer permissions.
+ For subscription requirements, see [Set up integrations in the console](integration-console-setup-process.md).

## Configure Microsoft Entra
<a name="onedrive-entra-setup"></a>

If you are using **Default OAuth app** authentication, skip this section and proceed to [Setting up the connector in Amazon Quick](#onedrive-action-integration-setup).

Before you configure Amazon Quick, create an app registration in Microsoft Entra. Complete all of the following steps in Entra before moving to the Amazon Quick console.

For more information about app registrations, see [Register an application with the Microsoft identity platform](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/quickstart-register-app) in the Microsoft documentation.

### Register the application
<a name="entra-app-registration"></a>

1. Open the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com/).

1. In the left navigation, choose **Entra ID**, then choose **App registrations**.

1. Choose **New registration**.

1. For **Name**, enter a descriptive name for your integration.

1. For **Supported account types**, choose **Accounts in this organizational directory only**.

1. For **Redirect URI**, select **Web** and enter `https://{{{region}}}.quicksight.aws.amazon.com/sn/oauthcallback`. Replace {{{region}}} with the AWS Region where your Amazon Quick instance is deployed.

1. Choose **Register**.

1. On the overview page, copy the **Application (client) ID** and **Directory (tenant) ID**. You need these values for the Amazon Quick configuration.

### Create a client secret
<a name="entra-client-secret"></a>

Amazon Quick needs a client secret to authenticate with Microsoft Entra. This secret acts as a password for the app registration.

1. From your app registration, choose **Certificates & secrets**.

1. Choose **New client secret**.

1. Enter a description and choose an expiration period.

1. Choose **Add**.

1. Copy the **Value** immediately. This value is only displayed once.

**Important**  
Copy the secret **Value**, not the Secret ID. The Value is the longer string used for authentication.

### Configure API permissions
<a name="onedrive-entra-api-permissions"></a>

This integration uses delegated permissions, which allow the app to act on behalf of a signed-in user. For more information, see [Overview of Microsoft Graph permissions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-overview) in the Microsoft documentation.

1. From your app registration, choose **API permissions**.

1. Choose **Add a permission**, then choose **Microsoft Graph**.

1. Choose **Delegated permissions** and add the permissions from the table below.

1. Choose **Grant admin consent for [your tenant name]** to approve the permissions.

Add the following as Delegated permissions in your Entra app registration. For the full permissions reference, see [Microsoft Graph permissions reference](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-reference) in the Microsoft documentation.


**OneDrive action integration – delegated permissions**  

| Permission | Description | 
| --- | --- | 
| Files.ReadWrite | Allows the app to read, create, update, and delete the signed-in user's files. | 
| Files.ReadWrite.All | Allows the app to read, create, update, and delete all files the signed-in user can access. | 
| offline\_access | Allows the app to refresh access tokens without requiring the user to sign in again. This reduces how often users need to re-authenticate. | 
| Sites.Read.All | Allows the app to read documents and list items in all site collections on behalf of the signed-in user. | 
| User.Read | Allows the app to read the signed-in user's profile. | 
| User.Read.All | Allows the app to read the full set of profile properties of all users in the organization on behalf of the signed-in user. | 

### Record your credentials
<a name="entra-record-credentials"></a>

Before leaving the Microsoft Entra admin center, confirm you have the following values. You need them for the Amazon Quick configuration.


**Required credentials from Microsoft Entra**  

| Value | Where to find it | 
| --- | --- | 
| Application (client) ID | App registration overview page | 
| Directory (tenant) ID | App registration overview page | 
| Client secret value | Certificates & secrets page |

## Manage and troubleshoot
<a name="entra-troubleshooting"></a>

To edit, share, or delete your integration, see [Managing existing integrations](integration-workflows.md#managing-existing-integrations).

### Authentication issues
<a name="entra-troubleshooting-auth"></a>
+ **Incorrect app registration** – Verify the app registration in Microsoft Entra includes the required API permissions and that admin consent has been granted.
+ **Expired client secret** – Check if the client secret has expired in **Certificates & secrets** and generate a new one if needed.
+ **Incorrect redirect URI** – Verify the redirect URI in Microsoft Entra matches `https://{{{region}}}.quicksight.aws.amazon.com/sn/oauthcallback`.

### Common error messages
<a name="entra-troubleshooting-errors"></a>
+ **`Access denied. You do not have permission to perform this action`** – The authenticated user does not have the required permissions. Contact your administrator to verify and grant appropriate permissions.
+ **`AADSTS50020: User account from identity provider does not exist in tenant`** – The user account is not configured in the correct Microsoft Entra tenant. Verify the user account exists in the tenant that matches the Directory (tenant) ID in your app registration.

## Admin consent for Microsoft 365
<a name="onedrive-action-admin-consent"></a>

When you use the **Default OAuth app** authentication method, Amazon Quick uses an AWS-managed application to access Microsoft OneDrive on behalf of the signed-in user. Most users can complete setup without any extra steps. However, if your Microsoft 365 tenant restricts third-party app access, a Microsoft 365 administrator must grant one-time consent before users can connect.

If you see an error when you sign in during connector setup, your organization might restrict third-party app access. Share the following information with your Microsoft 365 administrator:
+ **What to do:** Grant admin consent for the Amazon Quick Microsoft OneDrive integration application.
+ **Why:** Amazon Quick needs delegated access to OneDrive files, folders, and Excel workbooks to perform actions on behalf of users.

An administrator can grant consent in one of the following ways:
+ **Through the consent dialog** – A Global Administrator or Privileged Role Administrator initiates the connector setup flow. In the Microsoft sign-in dialog, they select the **Consent on behalf of your organization** check box and choose **Accept**.
+ **Through the Microsoft Entra admin center** – Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com/) on the Microsoft website. Choose **Enterprise applications**, locate the Amazon Quick application, choose **Permissions**, and choose **Grant admin consent for {{Your Organization}}**.

After consent is granted, any user in your organization can connect without being prompted for individual consent.

**Note**  
To check whether your tenant restricts user consent, go to the Microsoft Entra admin center and choose **Enterprise applications**, **Consent and permissions**, **User consent settings**. If the setting is **Do not allow user consent**, an administrator must grant consent before users can use the connector.
