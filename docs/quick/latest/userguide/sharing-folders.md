# Create and manage membership permissions for

Quick Sight shared folders

**Shared folders (unrestricted)**

To create a shared folder and to share the folder with one or more groups in the
Quick console, you must be an Amazon QuickSight administrator. You can also
create a shared folder with the `CreateFolder` API operation. Use the
following procedure to share or modify the membership permissions of a shared
folder.

1. From the left navigation, choose **Folders** then
   **Shared Folders**. Find the folder that you want to share
   or manage permissions for.
2. To open the actions menu for that folder's row, choose the ellipsis
   (three dots).
3. Choose **Share**.
4. In the **Share folder** modal, add the groups and users with
   whom you want to share the contents of the folder.
5. For each user and group that you add, choose a permission level from the
   **Permissions** menu in that row.
6. To update the permission type for an existing user, choose **Manage
   folder access**.
7. When you're done setting user and group permissions for the folder,
   choose **Share**. Users are not notified that they now have
   access to the folder.
   **Restricted shared folders**

Restricted shared folders can only be created with the `CreateFolder` API
operation. The following example creates a restricted shared folder.

```
aws quicksight create-folder \
--aws-account-id `AWSACCOUNTID` \
--region `us-east-1` \
--folder-id `example-folder-name` \
--folder-type RESTRICTED \
--name `"Example Folder"` \
```

After you create a restricted shared folder, assign folder contributor and viewer
permissions with a `UpdateFolderPermissions` API call. The following example
updates the permissions of a restricted shared folder to grant contributor permissions
to a user.

```
aws quicksight update-folder-permissions \
--aws-account-id `AWSACCOUNTID` \
--region `us-east-1` \
--folder-id `example-folder-name` \
--grant-permissions Principal=arn:aws:quicksight::`us-east-
1`::`AWSACCOUNTID`:user/default/:username,Actions=quicksight:CreateFolder
,quicksight:DescribeFolder, \
quicksight:CreateFolderMembership,quicksight:DeleteFolderMembership,qu
icksight:DescribeFolderPermissions \
```

The permissions that you pass to the user depend on the type of folder role that you
want to grant them. Use the following lists to determine which permissions are needed
for the user that you want to grant folder access to.

###### Folder owner

- quicksight:CreateFolder
- quicksight:DescribeFolder
- quicksight:UpdateFolder
- quicksight:DeleteFolder
- quicksight:CreateFolderMembership
- quicksight:DeleteFolderMembership

  After you create a shared folder, you can begin using the folder in
  Quick Sight.

You can also use the Quick Sight APIs to create special scaled folders that can be
shared with up to 3000 namespaces. To learn more about creating a scaled folder, see
[Creating Quick Sight scaled folders with the
Quick Sight APIs](folders-scaled.md "folders-scaled.md").
