# Zoom integration

With the Zoom connector, you can access the Zoom platform directly in
Amazon Quick through natural language. You can create and manage meetings, access
recordings and meeting summaries, view webinar details, and search contacts without
leaving Amazon Quick.

Amazon Quick supports multiple authentication methods for Zoom. Choose the
method that best fits your organization's security requirements.

- **Default OAuth app** – Uses an
  AWS-managed OAuth application. No additional credentials are needed.
  Users authenticate directly with their Zoom account.
- **Custom OAuth app** – Uses a
  customer-managed OAuth application registered in the Zoom App
  Marketplace. This option gives your organization full control over the
  OAuth configuration.
  For more information about the authentication methods that Amazon Quick
  supports, see [Authentication methods](quick-action-auth.md "quick-action-auth.md").

## Before you begin

Make sure that you have the following before you set up the
integration.

- An active Zoom account with access to the meetings, recordings,
  and webinars that you want to use.
- For **Custom OAuth app**: Access
  to the [Zoom App
  Marketplace](https://marketplace.zoom.us/ "https://marketplace.zoom.us/") on the Zoom website to create an
  app.
- For Amazon Quick subscription requirements, see [Set up integrations in the console](integration-console-setup-process.md "integration-console-setup-process.md").

## Configuring Zoom

If you are using **Default OAuth app**
authentication, skip this section and proceed to [Setting up the connector in Amazon Quick](#zoom-quicksuite-setup "#zoom-quicksuite-setup").

For Custom OAuth app authentication,
complete the following steps in the Zoom App Marketplace before
configuring Amazon Quick.

### Create a Zoom app (Custom OAuth app)

Create an app in the Zoom App Marketplace to obtain the client
credentials that you need for Amazon Quick. For more information, see
[OAuth](https://developers.zoom.us/docs/integrations/oauth/ "https://developers.zoom.us/docs/integrations/oauth/")
on the Zoom Developer website.

1. Sign in to the [Zoom App
   Marketplace](https://marketplace.zoom.us/ "https://marketplace.zoom.us/") on the Zoom website and go to the
   app creation portal.
2. Create a new application. Choose
   **General** for user-based OAuth or
   **Server-to-Server OAuth** for
   service-to-service authentication.
3. On the **Basic Information** tab, under
   **App Credentials**, record the following
   values. You need them when you configure Amazon Quick.

   - **Client ID**
   - **Client secret**

4. In the **OAuth Information** section, for
   **Authorized Redirect URI**, add the
   Amazon Quick callback URL:
   `https://`{region}`.quicksight.aws.amazon.com/sn/oauthcallback`
5. Choose the **Scopes** tab and choose
   **+ Add Scopes** to select the permissions
   that your integration requires. For the recommended scopes,
   see [Recommended scopes](#zoom-oauth-scopes "#zoom-oauth-scopes").

### Recommended scopes

The following scopes are requested when you connect to Zoom.
When you create a custom Zoom app, add these scopes on the
**Scopes** tab.

## Managing and troubleshooting

To edit, share, or delete your connector, see [Managing existing integrations](integration-workflows.md#managing-existing-integrations "integration-workflows.md#managing-existing-integrations").

### Authentication issues

- **Sign-in fails (Default OAuth app or
  Custom OAuth app)** – Verify that your Zoom
  account is active and that you can sign in to
  [zoom.us](https://zoom.us "https://zoom.us") on the Zoom website directly.
  For Custom OAuth app, confirm that the redirect URI in your
  Zoom app matches the Amazon Quick callback URL.
- **Invalid client credentials
  (Custom OAuth app)** – Verify that the Client ID and Client
  secret match the values in your Zoom app. You can view your
  credentials from the app settings in the Zoom App
  Marketplace.
- **Insufficient permissions** –
  Verify that the scopes configured for your Zoom app include
  the permissions required for the actions that you want to
  use. See [Recommended scopes](#zoom-oauth-scopes "#zoom-oauth-scopes").
