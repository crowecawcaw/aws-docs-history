# How Amazon Quick works

When you use Quick, the following components work together to process
your requests.

## You start in chat

Chat is the primary interface for Quick. You type a question, give an
instruction, or describe what you need. Quick interprets your request
and determines how to respond: answering from connected data, generating content,
running a workflow, conducting research, or taking action in an external application.
For more information, see [Ask questions, explore data, and get insights with chat in Amazon Quick](using-quick-chat.md "using-quick-chat.md").

## Agents process your requests

Behind every interaction is an agent. Agents are configured with instructions that
define their behavior, knowledge sources that ground their responses, and tools that
let them take action. Quick provides a default agent, and you can create
custom agents for specific domains. For more information, see [Create, customize, and deploy AI-powered chat agents in Amazon Quick](working-with-agents.md "working-with-agents.md").

## Spaces organize context

Spaces bring together the resources an agent needs: documents, dashboards,
datasets, knowledge bases, and connectors. When you assign a space to an
agent, it draws on everything in that space to answer questions and complete tasks.
You share spaces with your team so everyone benefits from the same context. For more
information, see [Organize, collaborate, and share resources with spaces in Amazon Quick](working-with-spaces.md "working-with-spaces.md").

## Integrations connect Quick to your world

Integrations give Quick access to external information and the ability
to act on your behalf:

**Knowledge bases**

Bring external content into Quick for AI retrieval.
Sources include Amazon S3, SharePoint, OneDrive, Confluence, Google Drive,
and web crawlers. Quick keeps the index in sync as sources
update.

**Connectors**

Let Quick read data, trigger workflows, and update
records in external services. You create connectors from OpenAPI
specifications or Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers.

**Extensions**

Embed Quick inside Chrome, Slack, Microsoft Teams, and
Microsoft 365 applications so you interact with agents without leaving
the app you're working in.

**Structured data connections**

Connect Quick Sight to databases, data warehouses, and data lakes
for analytics and visualization.
