<a name="desktop-interface"></a>

The Amazon Quick desktop application interface is organized into a sidebar for navigation, a top bar with panel toggles, and a main content area. You use the sidebar to access core features and manage your settings, and the top bar to open overlay panels for your activity feed, agents, tasks, and connected data sources.

## Sidebar navigation
