# Using Snowflake with Amazon Quick Sight

Snowflake is an AI data cloud platform that provides data solutions from data
warehousing and collaboration to data science and generative AI. Snowflake is an [AWS
Partner](https://partners.amazonaws.com/partners/001E000000d8qQcIAI/Snowflake "https://partners.amazonaws.com/partners/001E000000d8qQcIAI/Snowflake") with multiple AWS accreditations that include AWS ISV
Competencies in Generative AI, Machine Learning, Data and Analytics, and Retail.

Amazon Quick Sight offers two ways to connect to Snowflake: with your Snowflake login credentials
or with OAuth client credentials. Use the following sections to learn about both methods
of connection.

## Creating an Quick Sight data

source connection to Snowflake with login credentials

Use this section to learn how to create a connection between Quick Sight and
Snowflake with your Snowflake login credentials. All traffic between Quick Sight
and Snowflake is enabled by SSL.

###### To create a connection between Quick Sight and Snowflake

1. Open the [Quick console](https://quicksight.aws.amazon.com/ "https://quicksight.aws.amazon.com/").
2. From the left navigation pane, choose **Data**, then
   choose **Create**, then choose **New
   Dataset**.
3. Choose the **Snowflake** data source card.
4. In the pop up that appears, enter the following information:
   1. For **Data source name**, enter a descriptive
      name for your Snowflake data source connection. Because you can
      create many datasets from a connection to Snowflake, it's bets to
      keep the name simple.
   2. For **Connection type**, choose the type of
      network that you're using. Choose **Public
      network** if your data is shared publicly. Choose
      **VPC** if your data is located inside a VPC.
      To configure a VPC connection in Quick Sight, see [Managing VPC connection in
      Amazon Quick](vpc-creating-a-connection-in-quicksight.md "vpc-creating-a-connection-in-quicksight.md").
   3. For **Database server** enter the hostname
      specified in your Snowflake connection details.

5. For **Database name and Warehouse**, enter the respective
   Snowflake database and wearehouse that you want to connect.
6. For **Username** and **Password**, enter
   your Snowflake credentials.

After you have successfully created a data source connection between your
Quick Sight and Snowflake accounts, you can begin [Creating datasets](creating-data-sets.md "creating-data-sets.md") that contain
Snowflake data.

## Creating an

Quick Sight data source connection to Snowflake with OAuth
client credentials

You can use OAuth client credentials to connect your Quick Sight
account with Snowflake through the [Quick Sight
APIs](../../../quicksight/latest/APIReference/API_CreateDataSource.md "../../../quicksight/latest/APIReference/API_CreateDataSource.md"). _OAuth_ is a standard
authorization protocol that is often utilized for applications that have advanced
security requirements. When you connect to Snowflake with OAuth client credentials,
you can create datasets that contain Snowflake data with the Quick Sight APIs and
in the Quick Sight UI. For more information about configuring OAuth
in Snowflake, see [Snowflake OAuth overview](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/oauth-snowflake-overview "https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/oauth-snowflake-overview").

Quick Sight supports the `client credentials`
OAuth grant type. OAuth client credentials is used to
obtain an access token for machine-to-machine communication. This method is suitable
for scenarios where a client needs to access resources that are hosted on a server
without the involvement of a user.

In the client credentials flow of OAuth 2.0, there are several
client authentication mechanisms that can be used to authenticate the client
application with the authorization server. Quick Sight supports client credentials
based OAuth for Snowflake for the following two mechanisms:

- **Token (Client secrets-based
  OAuth)**: The secret-based client authentication
  mechanism is used with the client credentials to grant flow in order to
  authenticate with authorization server. This authentication scheme requires
  the `client_id` and `client_secret` of the
  OAuth client app to be stored in Secrets Manager.
- **X509 (Client private key JWT-based
  OAuth)**: The X509 certificate key-based
  solution provides an additional security layer to the OAuth
  mechanism with client certificates that are used to authenticate instead of
  client secrets. This method is primarily used by private clients who use
  this method to authenticate with the authorization server with strong trust
  between the two services.

Quick Sight has validated OAuth connections with the following
Identity providers:

- OKTA
- PingFederate

### Storing

OAuth credentials in Secrets Manager

OAuth client credentials are meant for machine-to-machine use cases and are
not designed to be interactive. To create a datasource connection between
Quick Sight and Snowflake, create a new secret in Secrets Manager that contains your
credentials for the OAuth client app. The secret ARN that is
created with the new secret can be used to create datasets that contain
Snowflake data in Quick Sight. For more information about using Secrets Manager keys in
Quick Sight, see [Using AWS Secrets Manager secrets instead of
database credentials in Quick](secrets-manager-integration.md "secrets-manager-integration.md").

The credentials that you need to store in Secrets Manager are determined by the
OAuth mechanism that you use. The following key/value pairs
are required for X509-based OAuth secrets:

- `username`: The Snowflake account username to be used when
  connecting to Snowflake
- `client_id`: The OAuth client ID
- `client_private_key`: The OAuth client
  private key
- `client_public_key`: The OAuth client
  certificate public key and its encrypted algorithm (for example,
  `{"alg": "RS256", "kid", "cert_kid"}`)

The following key/value pairs are required for token-based
OAuth secrets:

- `username`: The Snowflake account username to be used when
  connecting to Snowflake
- `client_id`: The OAuth client ID
- `client_secret`: the OAuth client
  secret

### Creating a

Snowflake OAuth connection with the Quick Sight APIs

After you create a secret in Secrets Manager that contains your Snowflake
OAuth credentials and have connected your Quick
account to Secrets Manager, you can establish a data source connection between
Quick Sight and Snowflake with the Quick Sight APIs and SDK. The following
example creates a Snowflake data source connection using token
OAuth client credentials.

```

{
    "AwsAccountId": "`AWSACCOUNTID`",
    "DataSourceId": "`UNIQUEDATASOURCEID`",
    "Name": "`NAME`",
    "Type": "SNOWFLAKE",
    "DataSourceParameters": {
        "SnowflakeParameters": {
            "Host": "`HOSTNAME`",
            "Database": "`DATABASENAME`",
            "Warehouse": "`WAREHOUSENAME`",
            "AuthenticationType": "TOKEN",
            "DatabaseAccessControlRole": "`snowflake-db-access-role-name`",
            "OAuthParameters": {
              "TokenProviderUrl": "`oauth-access-token-endpoint`",
              "OAuthScope": "`oauth-scope`",
              "IdentityProviderResourceUri" : "`resource-uri`",
              "IdentityProviderVpcConnectionProperties" : {
                "VpcConnectionArn": "`IdP-VPC-connection-ARN`"
             }
        }
    },
    "VpcConnectionProperties": {
        "VpcConnectionArn": "`VPC-connection-ARN-for-Snowflake`"
    }
    "Credentials": {
        "SecretArn": "`oauth-client-secret-ARN`"
    }
}
```

For more information about the CreateDatasource API operation, see [CreateDataSource](../../../quicksight/latest/APIReference/API_CreateDataSource.md "../../../quicksight/latest/APIReference/API_CreateDataSource.md").

Once the connection between Quick Sight and Snowflake is established and a
data source is created with the Quick Sight APIs or SDK, the new data source is
displayed in Quick Sight. Quick Sight authors can use this data source to
create datasets that contain Snowflake data. Tables are displayed based on the
role used in the `DatabaseAccessControlRole` parameter that is passed
in a `CreateDataSource` API call. If this parameter is not defined
when the data source connection is created, the default Snowflake role is
used.

After you have successfully created a data source connection between your
Quick Sight and Snowflake accounts, you can begin [Creating datasets](creating-data-sets.md "creating-data-sets.md") that
contain Snowflake data.
