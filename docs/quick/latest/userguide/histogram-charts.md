# Using histograms

Use a histogram chart in Amazon Quick to display the distribution of continuous
numerical values in your data. Amazon Quick uses un-normalized histograms, which use an
absolute count of the data points or events in each bin.

To create a histogram, you use one measure. A new histogram initially displays ten
_bins_ (also called _buckets_) across the X-axis. These appear as bars on the chart. You can
customize the bins to suit your dataset. The Y-axis displays the absolute count of the
values in each bin.

Make sure that you adjust the format settings so that you have a clearly identifiable
shape. If your data contains outliers, this becomes clear if you spot one or more values
off to the side of the X-axis. For information about how Amazon Quick handles data that
falls outside display limits, see [Display limits](working-with-visual-types.md#display-limits "working-with-visual-types.md#display-limits").

## Creating a histogram

Use the following procedure to create a histogram.

###### To create a histogram

1. On the analysis page, choose **Visualize** on the tool
   bar.
2. Choose **Add** on the application bar, and then choose
   **Add visual**.
3. On the **Visual types** pane, choose the histogram
   icon.
4. On the **Fields list** pane, choose the field that you
   want to use in the **Value** field well. A
   **Count** aggregate is automatically applied to the
   value.

The resulting histogram shows the following:

    * The X-axis displays 10 bins by default, representing the intervals
     in the measure that you choose. You can customize the bins in the
     next step.
    * The Y-axis displays the absolute count of individual values in
     each bin.

5. (Optional) Choose **Format** on the visual control to
   change the histogram format. You can format the bins either by count or
   width, not both together. The count setting changes how many bins display.
   The width setting changes how wide or long of an interval each bin contains.

## Formatting a histogram

Use the following procedure to format a histogram.

###### To format a histogram

1. Choose the histogram chart that you want to work with. It should be the
   highlighted selection. The visual controls display on the top right of the
   histogram.
2. Choose the cog icon on the visual control menu to view the
   **Format visual** options.
3. On the **Properties** pane, set the following options to
   control the display of the histogram:
   - **Histogram** settings. Chose
     _one_ of the following settings:
     - Bin count (option 1): The number of bins that display on
       the X-axis.
     - Bin width (option 1): The width (or length) of each
       interval. This setting controls the number of items or
       events to include in each bin. For example, if your data is
       in minutes, you can set this to 10 to show 10-minute
       intervals.

   - With the following settings, you can explore the best way to
     format the histogram for your dataset. For example, in some cases,
     you might have a tall peak in one bin, while most of the other bins
     look sparse. This isn't a useful view. You can use the
     following settings individually or together:
     - Change the **Number of data points
       displayed** in the **X-axis**
       settings.

     Amazon Quick displays up to 100 bins (buckets) by default.
     If you want to display more (up to 1,000), change the X-axis
     setting for **Number of data points
     displayed**.
     - Enable **Logarithmic scale** in the
       **Y-axis** settings.

     Sometimes your data doesn't fit the shape that you
     want and this can provide misleading results. For example,
     if the shape is skewed so far to the right that you
     can't read it properly, you can apply a log scale to
     it. Doing this doesn't normalize your data; however, it
     does reduce the skew.
     - Display **Data labels**.

     You can enable the display of data labels to see the
     absolute counts in the chart. Even if you don't want to
     display these in most cases, you can enable them while
     you're developing an analysis. The labels can help you
     decide on formatting and filtering options because they
     reveal counts in bins that are too small to stand out.

     To see all the data labels, even if they overlap, enable
     **Allow labels to overlap**.

4. (Optional) Change other visual settings. For more information, see [Formatting in Amazon Quick](formatting-a-visual.md "formatting-a-visual.md").

## Understanding histograms

Although histograms look similar to bar charts, they are very different. In fact,
the only similarity is their appearance because they use bars. On a histogram, each
bar is called a _bin_ or a _bucket_.

Each bin contains a range of values called an _interval_. When you pause on one of the bins, details about the
interval appear in a tooltip that shows two numbers enclosed in glyphs. The type of
enclosing glyphs indicates if the numbers inside them are part of the interval
that's inside the selected bin, as follows:

- A square bracket next to a number means that the number is included.
- A parenthesis next to a number means that the number is excluded.

For example, let's say that the first bar in a histogram displays the
following notation.

```
[1, 10)
```

The square bracket means that the number 1 is included in the first interval. The
parenthesis means that the number 10 is excluded.

In the same histogram, a second bar displays the following notation.

```
[10, 20)
```

In this case, 10 is included in the second interval, and 20 is excluded. The
number 10 can't exist in both intervals, so the notation shows us which one
includes it.

###### Note

The pattern used for marking intervals in a histogram comes from standard
mathematical notation. The following examples show the possible patterns, using
a set of numbers that includes 10, 20, and every number in between.

- [10, 20] – This set is closed. It has hard boundaries on both
  ends.
- [10, 21) – This set is half open. It has a hard boundary on the
  left and a soft boundary on the right.
- (9, 20] – This set is half open. It has a soft boundary on the
  left and a hard boundary on the right.
- (9, 21) – This set is open. It has soft boundaries on both
  ends.

Because the histogram uses quantitative data (numbers) rather than qualitative
data, there's a logical order to the distribution of the data. This is called a
_shape_. The shape is often described the
qualities the shape possesses, based on the count in each bin. Bins that contain a
higher number of values form a _peak_. Bins that
contain a lower number of values form a _tail_ on
the edge of a chart, and a _valley_ between peaks.
Most histograms fall into one of the following shapes:

- Asymmetrical or _skewed_ distributions
  have values that cluster near the left or the right—the low or high
  end of the X-axis. The direction of skewness is defined by where the longer
  tail of the data is, not by where the peak is. It's defined this way
  because this direction also describes the location of the mean (average). In
  skewed distributions, the mean and the median are two different numbers. The
  different types of skewed distribution are as follows:
  - _Negatively_ skewed or _left_ skewed – A chart that has
    the mean to the left of the peak. It has a longer tail to the left
    and a peak to the right, sometimes followed by a shorter
    tail.
  - _Positively_ skewed or _right_ skewed – A chart that has
    the mean to the right of the peak. It has a longer tail to the right
    and a peak to the left, sometimes preceded by a shorter tail.

- Symmetrical or _normal_ distributions
  have a shape that's mirrored on each side of a center point (for
  example, a bell curve). In a normal distribution, the mean and the median
  are the same value. The different types of normal distribution are as
  follows:
  - Normal distribution, or _unimodal_ – A chart that has one central peak
    representing the most common value. This is commonly called a bell
    curve, or a Gaussian distribution.
  - Bimodal – A chart that has two peaks representing the most
    common values.
  - Multimodal – A chart that has three or more peaks
    representing the most common values.
  - Uniform – A chart that has no peaks or valleys, with a
    relatively equal distribution of data.

The following table shows how a histogram differs from a bar chart.
