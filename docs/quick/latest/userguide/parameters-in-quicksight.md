# Parameters in Amazon Quick

_Parameters_ are named variables that can transfer a
value for use by an action or an object. By using parameters, you can create an easier way
for a dashboard user to interact with dashboard features in a less technical way. Parameters
can also connect one dashboard to another, allowing a dashboard user to drill down into data
that's in a different analysis.

For example, a dashboard user can use a list to choose a value. That value sets a
parameter that in turn sets a filter, calculation, or URL action to the chosen value. Then
the visuals in the dashboard react to the user's choices.

To make the parameters accessible to the dashboard viewer, you add a parameter control.
You can set up cascading controls, so that a selection in one control filters the options
that display in another control. A control can appear as a list of options, a slider, or a
text entry area. If you don't create a control, you can still pass a value to your
parameter in the dashboard URL.

For a parameter to work, it needs to be connected to something in your analysis,
regardless of whether it has a related control. You can reference parameters in the
following:

- Calculated fields (except for multivalue parameters)
- Filters
- Dashboard and analysis URLs
- Actions
- Titles and descriptions throughout an analysis
  Some ways that you can use parameters are the following:

- Using a calculation, you can transform data that is shown in an analysis.
- If you add a control with a filter to an analysis you are publishing, the
  dashboard users can filter the data without creating their own filters.
- Using controls and custom actions, you can let dashboard users set values for the
  URL actions.
