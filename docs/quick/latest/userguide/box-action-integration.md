<a name="box-action-integration"></a>

With the Box connector, you can access Box AI features, manage files and folders, and organize content in hubs directly in Amazon Quick through natural language.

Amazon Quick supports the following authentication methods for Box Agent.
+ **Default OAuth app** – Uses an AWS-managed OAuth application. No additional credentials are needed. You authenticate directly with your Box account.
+ **Custom OAuth app** – Uses a customer-managed OAuth 2.0 application registered in the Box Developer Console. This option gives your organization full control over the OAuth configuration.

For more information about the authentication methods that Amazon Quick supports, see [Authentication methods](quick-action-auth.md).

## Before you begin

+ A Box account with access to files and folders.
