# Sync reports and observability
<a name="sync-reports-observability"></a>

With Amazon Quick, you can view sync schedules, sync activity logs, and detailed sync reports for every knowledge base. If your knowledge base has document-level access control (ACL) enabled, you can also verify individual document permissions.

## Sync schedules and activity
<a name="sync-reports-schedules"></a>

To view sync schedules and activity, open a knowledge base and choose the **Sync schedules** tab.

Sync schedule  
Displays the configured sync frequency and timing. The table shows the occurrence (for example, Daily), the start time for the next scheduled sync, and the email notification status. You can add or modify sync schedules. To receive email notifications for sync failures, turn on **Email on sync failure**.

Sync activity  
Displays a historical log of all past syncs. You can filter by time frame (for example, Last 90 days) and sync status (for example, All, Completed, Failed).

The following table describes the sync activity columns:


**Sync activity columns**  

| Column | Description | 
| --- | --- | 
| Start time | The date and time the sync began. | 
| Sync status | The outcome of the sync: Queued (waiting to run), Completed (all items processed), Completed with issues (some items were skipped or failed), or Failed. | 
| Duration | How long the sync took to complete. | 
| Total items scanned | The number of items processed during the sync. | 
| Type | Whether the sync was Scheduled (automatic) or Manual (initiated by choosing the Sync now button). | 
| Sync report | A View report link that opens the detailed sync report for that run. | 

**Tip**  
To start a sync on demand, choose **Sync now** on the knowledge base detail page.

### Sync items
<a name="sync-reports-items"></a>

The sync items section shows all items that were processed during the sync, organized into the following categories:

Available items  
Items that are present and indexed in the knowledge base after the sync:  
+ **Unmodified** – Items already indexed that have not changed since the last sync.
+ **Modified** – Previously indexed items that were updated and re-indexed.
+ **Added** – New items indexed for the first time.

Unavailable items  
Items that are not available in the knowledge base after the sync:  
+ **Skipped** – Items filtered out (for example, empty files, unsupported formats, or items outside the date filter range).
+ **Failed** – Items that could not be processed because of an error.
+ **Deleted** – Items previously indexed that have been removed from the source.

### Filter and inspect individual items
<a name="sync-reports-filter"></a>

The **All items** tab displays the complete list of items that were processed during the sync. You can narrow the results by using the following filters:


**Sync item filters**  

| Filter | Description | 
| --- | --- | 
| Filter by status | Filter items by their sync status (for example, Added, Modified, Unmodified, Skipped, Failed, Deleted). | 
| Filter by error type | Filter failed or skipped items by their specific error type. | 
| Filter by item title | Search for a specific item by name. | 

After you set your filters, choose **Apply filters** to update the results.

The following table describes the sync item columns:


**Sync item columns**  

| Column | Description | 
| --- | --- | 
| Item Title | The name of the file, page, or item. | 
| Item Status | The sync status for this item. | 
| Error type | The category of error, if applicable. | 
| Error message | A detailed description of why the item failed or was skipped. | 

### Download report

To export the full sync results for offline analysis, choose **Download detailed report (.csv)** in the Sync items section. The CSV file includes all items with their status, error type, and error message.

## Check document access (ACL verification)
<a name="sync-reports-acl-verification"></a>

If your knowledge base has document-level access control (ACL) enabled, you can verify whether a specific user has access to a particular document. Use this feature to troubleshoot when users cannot see documents that you expect them to access, or to confirm that sensitive documents are properly restricted.

**Note**  
ACL verification is available for admin-managed SharePoint and Google Drive knowledge bases with ACL management enabled. Amazon S3 knowledge bases with document-level ACLs are not included in this feature. Because the ACL configuration files are customer-managed, you can verify them directly in Amazon S3.

1. Open the knowledge base and choose the **Sync reports** tab.

1. In the sync items list, choose the actions menu (**⋮**) for an item.

1. Choose **View Access Details**.

The **Access Details** panel shows:
+ The document name, status, and last synced timestamp.
+ **Permission Checker** – Enter a user's email address and choose **Check Access** to verify whether that user can access the document.
+ **Users and group membership** – Lists all users and groups with access to the document.

The following table describes the permission checker results:


**Permission checker results**  

| Result | Meaning | 
| --- | --- | 
| User has access | The user's identity matches the document's ACL. They see this document in Quick responses. | 
| [user] does not have access to this document | The user is not in the document's ACL. Quick does not surface this document for them. | 
| No access control list found | The ACL was not crawled for this document. Either ACL management is not enabled, or the required permissions are not configured correctly. | 

If you see "No access control list found", take the following steps:
+ Verify that ACL management is enabled in the knowledge base settings.
+ Confirm the app registration has the required ACL permissions for your data source.
+ Run a full sync after you fix the permissions.
