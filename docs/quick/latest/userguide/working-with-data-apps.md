# Working with data in apps in Quick

You can persist and manage data within your apps in Quick apps in multiple ways.

## Built-in app storage

The simplest way to persist data is with built-in app storage. It is a key-value
system that requires no external setup and scales to support large numbers of records.

### Storage scopes

- **Private storage** — Data visible only
  to the current user. Use for personal settings, preferences, saved filters,
  bookmarks, and per-user state.
- **Shared storage** — Data visible to
  anyone with app access. Use for collaborative lists, comments, votes, shared
  configuration, and team data.

### Storage operations

| Operation   | Private | Shared | Description                                  |
| ----------- | ------- | ------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| Put Item    | Yes     | Yes    | Store or update a key-value item.            |
| Get Item    | Yes     | Yes    | Retrieve an item by key.                     |
| List Items  | Yes     | Yes    | List items with optional key prefix filter.  |
| Delete Item | Yes     | Yes    | Remove an item by key.                       |
| List by Tag | No      | Yes    | Query shared items by tag (secondary index). |

### Key concepts

- **Tables** — Logical groupings for your
  data. You define table names; no setup is required.
- **Keys** — Each item has a unique key
  within its table. Keys can be up to 255 characters.
- **Values** — String values up to 350 KB.
  Use JSON serialization for structured data.
- **Tags (shared only)** — Optional
  categorization strings on shared items. Tags enable efficient querying by
  category.
- **Write modes** — UPSERT (default)
  overwrites existing items. INSERT fails if the key already exists, which is
  useful for preventing duplicates.

###### Note

Each app has completely separate storage. Data persists across user sessions
and app reloads.

## Exporting data

You can ask the agent to add export functionality. Apps in Quick supports exporting
data as CSV, JSON, PDF, and Excel files through the bridge API. You can also have your
app write data snapshots to a connected space. This serves as a backup and makes
the data available to other Quick capabilities.

## Handling write approvals when AI inference is active

When an app uses AI inference and writes data (to shared storage or through an action
connector), you must review and approve each write payload. This security measure
ensures that you review AI-generated content before the app persists it.

Three strategies can reduce the frequency of approval prompts:

1. **Batch writes** — Collect all items and
   save them under a single storage key in one operation.
2. **Separate AI from writes** — Design the
   app so that AI processing and data persistence happen in distinct user
   actions.
3. **Remove AI inference when not needed** —
   If your app does not use AI-generated content, ensure the AI inference
   integration is not registered. Without AI inference, you can choose "Allow on
   this app" for write operations. The permission persists across
   sessions.

## Accessing user information

With apps in Quick, you can access the current user's identity at runtime. This lets you
personalize the app experience, display the user's name, or implement per-user
logic.

Available user information includes email, first name, last name, and identity
name.

###### Tip

Combine user identity with private storage to build personalized experiences such
as greetings, saved preferences, bookmarks, and custom dashboards per user.
