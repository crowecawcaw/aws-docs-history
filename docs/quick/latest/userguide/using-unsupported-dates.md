# Using unsupported or custom dates

Amazon Quick Sight natively supports a limited number of date formats. However, you can’t always
control the format of the data provided to you. When your data contains a date in an
unsupported format, you can tell Amazon Quick Sight how to interpret it.

You can do this by editing the dataset, and changing the format of the column from
text or numeric to date. A screen appears after you make this change, so you can enter
the format. For example, if you are using a relational data source, you can specify
MM-dd-yyyy for a text field containing '09-19-2017', so it is interpreted as
2017-09-19T00:00:00.000Z. If you are using a nonrelational data source, you can do the
same thing starting with a numeric field or a text field.

Amazon Quick Sight only supports text to date for relational (SQL) sources.

For more information on supported date formats, see [Supported date formats](supported-data-types-and-values.md#supported-date-formats "supported-data-types-and-values.md#supported-date-formats").

Use this procedure to help Amazon Quick Sight understand dates in different formats.

1. For a dataset containing unsupported date formats, edit the data as follows.
   For the column containing your datetime data, change the data type from text to
   date. Do this by choosing the colorful data type icon beneath the column name in
   the data preview.

###### Note

Integer dates that aren’t Unix epoch datetimes don't work as is. For
example, these formats are not supported as integers: `MMddyy`,
`MMddyyyy`, `ddMMyy`, `ddMMyyyy`, and
`yyMMdd`. The workaround is to first change them to text
format. Make sure all your rows contain six digits (not five). Then change
the text data type to datetime.

For more information on Unix epoch datetimes, see [epochDate](epochDate-function.md "epochDate-function.md").

When you change the data type to date, the **Edit date
format** screen appears. 2. Enter your date format, indicating which parts are month, date, year, or time.
Formats are case-sensitive. 3. Choose **Validate** to make sure Amazon Quick Sight can now interpret
your datetime data with the format you specified. Rows that don't validate are
skipped and omitted from the dataset. 4. When you are satisfied with the results, choose **Update**.
Otherwise, choose **Close**.
