# netWorkDays
<a name="netWorkDays-function"></a>

`netWorkDays` returns the number of working days between the provided two date fields or even custom date values generated using other Quick date functions such as `parseDate` or `epochDate` as an integer. 

`netWorkDays` assumes a standard 5-day work week starting from Monday and ending on Friday. Saturday and Sunday are assumed to be weekends. The calculation is inclusive of both `startDate` and `endDate`. The function operates on and shows results for DAY granularity. 

## Syntax
<a name="netWorkDays-function-syntax"></a>

```
netWorkDays({{startDate}}, {{endDate}})
```

## Arguments
<a name="netWorkDays-function-arguments"></a>

 *startDate*   
A valid non-NULL date that acts as the start date for the calculation.   
+ Dataset fields: Any `date` field from the dataset that you are adding this function to.
+ Date Functions: Any date output from another `date` function, for example, `parseDate`.
+ Calculated fields: Any Quick calculated field that returns a `date` value.
+ Parameters: Any Quick `DateTime` parameter.
+ Any combination of the above stated argument values.

 *endDate*   
A valid non-NULL date that acts as the end date for the calculation.   
+ Dataset fields: Any `date` field from the dataset that you are adding this function to.
+ Date Functions: Any date output from another `date` function, for example, `parseDate`.
+ Calculated fields: Any Quick calculated field that returns a `date` value.
+ Parameters: Any Quick `DateTime` parameter.
+ Any combination of the above stated argument values.

## Return type
<a name="netWorkDays-function-return-type"></a>

Integer 

## Ouptut values
<a name="netWorkDays-function-output-type"></a>

Expected output values include:
+ Positive integer (when start\_date < end\_date)
+ Negative integer (when start\_date > end\_date)
+ NULL when one or both of the arguments get a null value from the `dataset field`.

## Example
<a name="netWorkDays-function-example"></a>

The following example returns the number of work days falling between two dates.

Let's assume that there's a field named `application_date` with the following values:

```
netWorkDays({startDate}, {endDate})
```

The following are the given field values.

```
startDate	endDate	netWorkDays
        9/4/2022	9/11/2022	5
        9/9/2022	9/2/2022	-6
        9/10/2022	9/11/2022	0
        9/12/2022	9/12/2022	1
```

The following example calculates the number of days worked by each employee and the salary expended per day for each employee:

```
days_worked = netWorkDays({employment_start_date}, {employment_end_date})
        salary_per_day = {salary}/{days_worked}
```

The following example filters employees whose employment ends on a work day and determines whether their employment began on work day or a weekend using conditional formatting:

```
is_start_date_work_day = netWorkDays(employment_start_date)
        is_end_date_work_day = netWorkDays(employment_end_date)
```
