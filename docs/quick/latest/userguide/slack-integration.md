# Slack integration

With the Slack connector, you can access the Slack platform directly in
Amazon Quick through natural language. You can send messages, manage channels,
search content, and interact with users and user groups without leaving
Amazon Quick.

Amazon Quick supports multiple authentication methods for Slack. Choose the
method that best fits your organization's security requirements.

- **Default OAuth app** – Uses an
  AWS-managed OAuth application. No additional credentials are needed.
  You authenticate directly with your Slack workspace.
- **Custom OAuth app** – Uses a
  customer-managed Slack app. This option gives your organization full
  control over the OAuth configuration.
- **Bearer Token** – Uses a Slack bot
  token for authentication. This method is suitable for bot-level access
  to a workspace.
  For more information about the authentication methods that Amazon Quick
  supports, see [Authentication methods](quick-action-auth.md "quick-action-auth.md").

## Before you begin

Make sure that you have the following before you set up the
integration.

- A Slack workspace with access to the channels and data that you
  want to use.
- For **Custom OAuth app**: Access to
  the [Slack API
  dashboard](https://api.slack.com/apps "https://api.slack.com/apps") on the Slack website to create an app.
- For **Bearer Token**: A bot token
  (starts with `xoxb-`) from a Slack app. For more
  information, see [Quickstart
  app settings](https://docs.slack.dev/app-management/quickstart-app-settings "https://docs.slack.dev/app-management/quickstart-app-settings") on the Slack website.
- For Amazon Quick subscription requirements, see [Set up integrations in the console](integration-console-setup-process.md "integration-console-setup-process.md").

## Configuring Slack

If you are using **Default OAuth app**
authentication, skip this section and go to [Setting up the connector in Amazon Quick](#slack-quicksuite-setup "#slack-quicksuite-setup").

For Custom OAuth app or Bearer Token authentication, complete the
applicable steps in Slack before you configure Amazon Quick.

### Create a Slack app for Custom OAuth app or Bearer Token

Create a Slack app to get the client credentials or bot token that
you need for Amazon Quick.

1. Go to the [Slack API
   dashboard](https://api.slack.com/apps "https://api.slack.com/apps") on the Slack website and choose
   **Create New App**.
2. Choose **From scratch**.
3. Enter an **App Name** and select your Slack
   workspace. Choose **Create App**.
4. In the left sidebar, choose **OAuth &
   Permissions**.
5. Under **Redirect URLs**, choose
   **Add New Redirect URL** and enter the
   Amazon Quick callback URL:
   `https://`{region}`.quicksight.aws.amazon.com/sn/oauthcallback`

Choose **Add**, then choose
**Save URLs**. 6. Under **Scopes**, add the Bot Token Scopes
that your integration requires. For the recommended scopes,
see [Recommended scopes](#slack-oauth-scopes "#slack-oauth-scopes"). 7. In the left sidebar, choose **Basic
Information**. Under **App
Credentials**, record the following values:

    * **Client ID**
    * **Client secret**

8. For **Bearer Token**: Install
the app to your workspace from the **OAuth &
Permissions** page. After installation, copy the
**Bot User OAuth Token** (starts with
`xoxb-`).

### Recommended scopes

The following scopes are requested when you connect to Slack.
When you create a custom Slack app, add these scopes on the
**OAuth & Permissions** page. For Custom OAuth
app, add them as **User Token Scopes**. For Bearer
Token, add them as **Bot Token Scopes**.

## Setting up the connector in Amazon Quick

### Connect from the Available tab

If you want to use Default OAuth app authentication, you can connect
directly from the **Available** tab without additional
configuration.

1. In the Amazon Quick console, choose
   **Connectors**.
2. On the **Available** tab, find
   **Slack** and choose
   **Connect**.
3. Complete the Slack sign-in flow and grant the requested
   permissions.

To configure a connector with Custom OAuth app or Bearer Token
instead, use the **Create for your team** tab as
described below.

### Create from the Create for your team tab

After you complete any required Slack configuration, create the connector
in Amazon Quick.

## Managing and troubleshooting

To edit, share, or delete your connector, see [Managing existing integrations](integration-workflows.md#managing-existing-integrations "integration-workflows.md#managing-existing-integrations").

### Authentication issues

- **Sign-in fails (Default OAuth app or
  Custom OAuth app)** – Verify that your Slack
  workspace is active and that you can sign in to
  [the Slack website](https://slack.com "https://slack.com") directly.
  For Custom OAuth app, confirm that the redirect URL in your
  Slack app matches the Amazon Quick callback URL.
- **Invalid client credentials (Custom
  OAuth app)** – Verify that the Client ID and
  Client secret match the values in your Slack app's Basic
  Information section.
- **Bearer Token rejected** –
  Verify that your bot token is active and starts with
  `xoxb-`. Tokens can be revoked from the Slack API
  dashboard.
- **Insufficient permissions** –
  Verify that the scopes configured for your Slack app include
  the permissions required for the actions that you want to
  use. See [Recommended scopes](#slack-oauth-scopes "#slack-oauth-scopes").
- **Channel not found or not in
  channel** – Verify that the bot has been added
  to the channel. Invite the bot to the channel before
  attempting to post messages or read history.
