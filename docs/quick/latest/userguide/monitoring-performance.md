<a name="automation-summary-charts"></a>

The dashboard includes three main performance visualizations:
+ **Automation Distribution** - Shows the number of deployed automations organized by automation group, helping you understand your automation footprint across the organization
+ **Success Rate** - Displays the percentage of cases that completed successfully versus those that encountered exceptions, providing insight into automation reliability
+ **Time Savings** - Calculates total hours saved based on successful case completions multiplied by the estimated time savings configured for each automation project

### Automation details table
<a name="automation-details-table"></a>

Each automation is listed with key metrics and status information:
+ **Automation name** - Name and version of the deployed automation
+ **Latest run** - Most recent execution status and timestamp
+ **Case metrics** - Count of cases processed, broken down by:
  + Successfully completed cases
  + Cases with business exceptions
  + Cases with system exceptions
+ **Tasks** - Number of human-in-the-loop tasks created by the automation

## Runs dashboard
<a name="runs-dashboard"></a>

The Runs tab provides detailed visibility into individual automation executions and their outcomes.

### Run statuses
<a name="run-statuses"></a>

Automations can be in one of these run statuses:
+ **Waiting** - The automation is queued and awaiting available system resources to begin execution. This is typically a brief transitional state.
+ **In Progress** - The automation is actively executing its configured steps. You can monitor real-time progress through the logs.
+ **Completed** - The automation has finished all steps successfully.
+ **Failed** - The automation encountered an error it could not recover from and stopped execution. Detailed error information is available in the logs.
+ **Stopped** - A user manually interrupted the automation execution using either the Exit or Terminate action.

**Note**  
Count of incomplete runs includes Waiting and In Progress.

### Run details table
<a name="run-details-table"></a>

Each run provides comprehensive execution information through the following columns:
+ **Status** - Current run status (as defined in Run Status Types)
+ **Automation** - Name of the automation being run
+ **Version** - Specific version number of the automation which ran
+ **Start time** - When the automation run began
+ **End time** - When the automation completed or stopped
+ **Duration** - Total running time of the automation
+ **Case metrics** - Count of cases processed, broken down by:
  + Successfully completed cases
  + Cases with business exceptions
  + Cases with system exceptions
+ **Tasks** - Number of human-in-the-loop tasks created in the run

## Cases dashboard
<a name="cases-dashboard"></a>

The Cases tab enables tracking of individual case records through their lifecycle.

### Case charts
<a name="case-charts"></a>

The dashboard includes two main performance visualizations:
+ **Total cases created** - Shows the number of cases created over time, helping you understand your automation volumes.
+ **Top exceptions** - Displays the top 5 exception reasons and the relative count of each, helping you prioritize your optimization efforts to improve success rates.

### Case statuses
<a name="case-statuses"></a>

Cases can be in one of these processing statuses:
+ **Ready** - The case has been created and is waiting to be picked up for processing. This is the initial state of all new cases.
+ **In Progress** - The case is actively being processed by the automation. You can monitor real-time progress through the logs.
+ **Pending Resolution** - The case is waiting for a human-in-the-loop task to be completed before processing can continue. Cases move back to Ready status after tasks are resolved.
+ **Successful** - The case has completed without any exceptions.
+ **Failed** - The case encountered one of the following exception types:
  + **Business Exception** - The case encountered a handled business rule violation and stopped processing. Detailed exception information is available in the logs.
  + **System Exception** - The case experienced a technical error and stopped processing. Detailed error information is available in the logs.

For detailed information about case handling and orchestration patterns, see [Orchestration actions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/actions-orchestration.html).

## Search and filtering
<a name="search-and-filtering"></a>

The Performance dashboard includes search and filtering capabilities available across all monitoring views to help you find specific information. Filter by:
+ Time range
+ Status
+ Automation group
+ Automation

**Note**  
You can also search on the cases page by reference name or exception reason.

### Environment selection
<a name="environment-selection"></a>

Switch between viewing metrics from:
+ Test - Data from automation testing in development environment
+ Deployed - Data from deployed automations

**Note**  
Your selected environment applies across all dashboard tabs until changed.

## CloudWatch
<a name="cloudwatch"></a>
