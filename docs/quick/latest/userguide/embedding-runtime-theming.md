# Customize the look and feel of

Amazon Quick Sight embedded dashboards and visuals

You can use the Amazon Quick Sight Embedding SDK (version 2.5.0 and higher) to make
changes to the theming of your embedded Amazon Quick Sight dashboards and visuals at
runtime. Runtime theming makes it easier to integrate your Software as a service
(SaaS) application with your Amazon Quick Sight embedded assets. Runtime theming allows
you to synchronize the theme of your embedded content with the themes of the parent
application that your Amazon Quick Sight assets are embedded into. You can also use
runtime theming to add customization options for readers. Theming changes can be
applied to embedded assets at initialization or throughout the lifetime of your
embedded dashboard or visual.

For more information about themes, see [Using themes in Amazon Quick Sight](themes-in-quicksight.md "themes-in-quicksight.md"). For more information about using the
Amazon Quick Sight Embedding SDK, see the [amazon-quicksight-embedding-sdk](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-quicksight-embedding-sdk "https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-quicksight-embedding-sdk") on GitHub.

**Prerequisites**

Before you can get started, make sure that you have the following
prerequisites.

- You are using the Amazon Quick Sight Embedding SDK version 2.5.0 or
  higher.
- Permissions to access the theme that you want to work with. To grant
  permissions to a theme in Amazon Quick Sight, make a
  `UpdateThemePermissions` API call or use the
  **Share** icon next to the theme in the
  Amazon Quick Sight console's analysis editor.

## Terminology and concepts

The following terminology can be useful when working with embedded runtime
theming.

- _Theme_ – A collection of settings that you
  can apply to multiple analyses and dashboards that change how the
  content is displayed.
- _ThemeConfiguration_ – A configuration
  object that contains all of the display properties for a theme.
- _Theme Override_ – A
  `ThemeConfiguration` object that is applied to the active
  theme to override some or all aspects of how content is
  displayed.
- _Theme ARN_ – An Amazon Resource Name (ARN)
  that identifies a Amazon Quick Sight theme. Following is an example of
  custom theme ARN.

`arn:aws:quicksight:region:account-id:theme/theme-id`

Amazon Quick Sight provided starter themes don't have a region in
their theme ARN. Following is an example of a starter theme ARN.

`arn:aws:quicksight::aws:theme/CLASSIC`

## Setting up

Make sure that you have the following information ready to get started working
with runtime theming.

- The theme ARNs of the themes that you want to use. You can choose an
  existing theme, or you can create a new one. To obtain a list all themes
  and theme ARNs in your Amazon Quick Sight account, make a call to the
  [ListThemes](../../../quicksight/latest/APIReference/API_ListThemes.md "../../../quicksight/latest/APIReference/API_ListThemes.md") API operation. For information on preset
  Amazon Quick Sight themes, see [Setting a default theme for
  Amazon Quick analyses with the Amazon Quick APIs](customizing-quicksight-default-theme.md "customizing-quicksight-default-theme.md").
- If you are using registered user embedding, make sure that the user
  has access to the themes that you want to use.

If you are using anonymous user embedding, pass a list of theme ARNs
to the `AuthorizedResourceArns` parameter of the
`GenerateEmbedUrlForAnonymousUser` API. Anonymous users
are granted access to any theme that is listed in the
`AuthorizedResourceArns` parameter.

## SDK method interface

**Setter methods**

The following table describes different setter methods that developers can use
for runtime theming.

| Method                                                   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| -------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `setTheme(themeArn: string)`                             | Replaces the active theme of a dashboard or visual with<br>another theme. If applied, the theme override is<br>removed.<br>An error is returned if you don't have access to the theme<br>or if the theme doesn't exist.                                                                                                                                  |
| `setThemeOverride(themeOverride:<br>ThemeConfiguration)` | Sets a dynamic `ThemeConfiguration` to override<br>the current active theme. This replaces the previously set<br>theme override. Any values that are not supplied in the new<br>`ThemeConfiguration` are defaulted to the<br>values in the currently active theme.<br>An error is returned if the<br>`ThemeConfiguration` that you supply is<br>invalid. |

## Initializing embedded content

with a theme

To initialize an embedded dashboard or visual with a non-default theme, define
a `themeOptions` object on the `DashboardContentOptions`
or `VisualContentOptions` parameters, and set the
`themeArn` property within `themeOptions` to the
desired theme ARN.

The following example initializes an embedded dashboard with the
`MIDNIGHT` theme.

```
import { createEmbeddingContext } from 'amazon-quicksight-embedding-sdk';

const embeddingContext = await createEmbeddingContext();

const {
    embedDashboard,
} = embeddingContext;

const frameOptions = {
    url: '<YOUR_EMBED_URL>',
    container: '#experience-container',
};
const contentOptions = {
    themeOptions: {
        themeArn: "arn:aws:quicksight::aws:theme/MIDNIGHT"
    }
};

// Embedding a dashboard experience
const embeddedDashboardExperience = await embedDashboard(frameOptions, contentOptions);
```

## Initializing

embedded content with a theme override

Developers can use theme overrides to define the theme of an embedded
dashboard or visual at runtime. This allows the dashboard or visual to inherit a
theme from a third-party application without the need to pre-configure a theme
within Amazon Quick Sight. To initialize an embedded dashboard or visual with a
theme override, set the `themeOverride` property within
`themeOptions` in either the `DashboardContentOptions`
or `VisualContentOptions` parameters. The following example overrides
the font of a dashboard's theme from the default font to `Amazon
 Ember`.

```
import { createEmbeddingContext } from 'amazon-quicksight-embedding-sdk';

const embeddingContext = await createEmbeddingContext();

const {
    embedDashboard,
} = embeddingContext;

const frameOptions = {
    url: '<YOUR_EMBED_URL>',
    container: '#experience-container',
};
const contentOptions = {
    themeOptions: {
        "themeOverride":{"Typography":{"FontFamilies":[{"FontFamily":"Comic Neue"}]}}
    }
};

// Embedding a dashboard experience
const embeddedDashboardExperience = await embedDashboard(frameOptions, contentOptions);
```

## Initializing

embedded content with preloaded themes

Developers can configure a set of dashboard themes to be preloaded on
initialization. This is most beneficial for quick toggling between different
views, for example dark and light modes. An embedded dashboard or visual can be
initialized with up to 5 preloaded themes. To use preloaded themes, set the
`preloadThemes` property in either
`DashboardContentOptions` or `VisualContentOptions`
with an array of up to 5 `themeArns`. The following example preloads
the `Midnight` and `Rainier` starter themes to a
dashboard.

```
import { createEmbeddingContext } from 'amazon-quicksight-embedding-sdk';

const embeddingContext = await createEmbeddingContext();

const {
    embedDashboard,
} = embeddingContext;

const frameOptions = {
    url: '<YOUR_EMBED_URL>',
    container: '#experience-container',
};
const contentOptions = {
    themeOptions: {
        "preloadThemes": ["arn:aws:quicksight::aws:theme/RAINIER", "arn:aws:quicksight::aws:theme/MIDNIGHT"]
    }
};

// Embedding a dashboard experience
const embeddedDashboardExperience = await embedDashboard(frameOptions, contentOptions);
```
