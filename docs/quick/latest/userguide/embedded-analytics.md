# Embedded analytics for Amazon Quick Sight

###### Important

Amazon Quick Sight has new API operations for embedding analytics:
`GenerateEmbedUrlForAnonymousUser` and
`GenerateEmbedUrlForRegisteredUser`.

You can still use the `GetDashboardEmbedUrl` and
`GetSessionEmbedUrl` API operations to embed dashboards and the
Amazon Quick Sight console, but they don't contain the latest embedding capabilities. For
more information about embedding using the old API operations, see [Embedding analytics using the
GetDashboardEmbedURL and GetSessionEmbedURL API
operations](embedded-analytics-deprecated.md "embedded-analytics-deprecated.md").

With Amazon Quick Sight embedded analytics, you can seamlessly integrate data-driven experiences
into your software applications. You can style the embedded components to match your brand.
This capability brings the power of Amazon Quick Sight to your end users, where they can
analyze and interact with data without ever leaving the application. Improving the user
experience by reducing cognitive complexity gives users a better opportunity for deeper
understanding and effectiveness.

Amazon Quick Sight supports embedding for these elements:

- Amazon Quick Sight console (full authoring experience for registered users )
- Amazon Quick Sight dashboards and visuals (for registered users, anonymous users,
  public end users)
- Amazon Quick Sight Q search bar (for registered users and anonymous users)
  With an embedded Amazon Quick Sight console, you embed the full Amazon Quick Sight
  experience. Doing this makes it possible to use Amazon Quick Sight authoring tools as part of
  your application, rather than in the context of the AWS Management Console or a standalone website. Users
  of an embedded Amazon Quick Sight console need to be registered as Amazon Quick Sight authors
  or admins in your AWS account. They also need to be authenticated into the same
  AWS account, using any of the Amazon Quick Sight-supported authentication methods.

With an embedded Amazon Quick Sight dashboard or visual, readers get the same functionality
and interactivity as they do in a published dashboard or visual. To use an embedded
dashboard or visual, readers (viewers) can include any of the following:

- Amazon Quick Sight users authenticated in your AWS account by any method
  supported by Amazon Quick Sight.
- Unauthenticated visitors to a website or application – This option requires
  session packs with capacity pricing
  . For information about subscription types,
  see [Understanding Amazon Quick Sight subscriptions and
  roles](../../../quicksight/latest/user/user-types.md#subscription-role-mapping "../../../quicksight/latest/user/user-types.md#subscription-role-mapping").
- Multiple end users viewing a display on monitors or large screens by programmatic
  access.
  If your app also resides in AWS, the app doesn't need to reside on the same
  AWS account as the Amazon Quick Sight subscription. However, the app needs to be able to
  assume the AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that you use for the API calls.

Before you can embed content, make sure that you're using Amazon Quick Sight
Enterprise edition in the AWS account where you plan to use embedding.

Amazon Quick Sight embedding is available in all supported AWS Regions.
