# Adding an ML insight to

detect outliers and key drivers

You can add an ML insight that detects _anomalies_, which are outliers that seem significant. To get
started, you create for your insight a widget, also known as an _autonarrative_. As you configure your options, you
can view a limited screenshot of your insight in the
**Preview** pane at screen right.

In your insight widget, you can add up to five dimension fields that are not
calculated fields. In the field wells, values for
**Categories** represent the dimensional values that
Amazon Quick Sight uses to split the metric. For example, let's say that you are
analyzing revenue across all product categories and product SKUs. There are 10
product categories, each with 10 product SKUs. Amazon Quick Sight splits the metric by the
100 unique combinations and runs anomaly detection on each combination for the
split.

The following procedure shows how to do this, and also how to add contribution
analysis to detect the key drivers that are causing each anomaly. You can add
contribution analysis later, as described in [Using contribution
analysis for key drivers](anomaly-detection-adding-key-drivers.md "anomaly-detection-adding-key-drivers.md").

###### To set up outlier analysis, including key drivers

1.  Open your analysis and in the toolbar, choose
    **Insights**, then **Add**. From
    the list, choose **Anomaly detection** and
    **Select**.
2.  Follow the screen prompt on the new widget, which tells you to choose
    fields for the insight. Add at least one date, one measure, and one
    dimension.
3.  Choose **Get started** on the widget. The
    configuration screen appears.
4.  Under **Compute options**, choose values for the
    following options.
    1. For **Combinations to be analysed**, choose
       one of the following options:
       1. **Hierarchical**

       Choose this option if you want to analyze the fields
       hierarchically. For example, if you chose a date (T), a
       measure (N), and three dimension categories (C1, C2, and
       C3), Quick Sight analyses the fields hierarchically, as
       shown following.

       ```
       T-N, T-C1-N, T-C1-C2-N, T-C1-C2-C3-N
       ```

       2. **Exact**

       Choose this option if you want to analyze only the
       exact combination of fields in the Category field well,
       as they are listed. For example, if you chose a date
       (T), a measure (N), and three dimension categories (C1,
       C2, and C3), Quick Sight analyses only the exact
       combination of category fields in the order they are
       listed, as shown following.

       ```
       T-C1-C2-C3-N
       ```

       3. **All**

       Choose this option if you want to analyze all field
       combinations in the Category field well. For example, if
       you chose a date (T), a measure (N), and three dimension
       categories (C1, C2, and C3), Quick Sight analyses all
       combinations of fields, as shown following.

       ````
       T-N, T-C1-N, T-C1-C2-N, T-C1-C2-C3-N, T-C1-C3-N, T-C2-N, T-C2-C3-N, T-C3-N
       ```If you chose a date and a measure only, Quick Sight analyses
       the fields by date and then by measure.
       ````

    In the **Fields to be analyzed** section, you
    can see a list of fields from the field wells for
    reference. 2. For **Name**, enter a descriptive
    alphanumeric name with no spaces, or choose the default value.
    This provides a name for the computation.

    If you plan on editing the narrative that automatically
    displays on the widget, you can use the name to identify this
    widget's calculation. Customize the name if you plan to edit the
    autonarrative and if you have other similar calculations in your
    analysis.

5.  In the **Display options** section, choose the
    following options to customize what is displayed in your insight widget.
    You can still explore all your results, no matter what you
    display.
    1. **Maximum number of anomalies to show**
       – The number of outliers you want to display in the
       narrative widget.
    2. **Severity** – The minimum level of
       severity for anomalies that you want to display in the insight
       widget.

    A _level of severity_ is a
    range of anomaly scores that is characterized by the lowest
    actual anomaly score included in the range. All anomalies that
    score higher are included in the range. If you set severity to
    **Low**, the insight displays all of the
    anomalies that rank between low and very high. If you set the
    severity to **Very high**, the insight displays
    only the anomalies that have the highest anomaly scores.

    You can use the following options:

        * **Very high**
        * **High and above**
        * **Medium and above**
        * **Low and above**

    3. **Direction** – The direction on the
       x-axis or y-axis that you want to identify as anomalous. You can
       choose from the following:
       - **Higher than expected** to identify
         higher values as anomalies.
       - **Lower than expected** to identify
         lower values as anomalies.
       - **[ALL]** to identify all anomalous
         values, high and low (default setting).

    4. **Delta** – Enter a custom value to
       use to identify anomalies. Any amount higher than the threshold
       value counts as an anomaly. The values here change how the
       insight works in your analysis. In this section, you can set the
       following:
       - **Absolute value** – The
         actual value to use. For example, suppose this is 48.
         Amazon Quick Sight then identifies values as anomalous when the
         difference between a value and the expected value is
         greater than 48.
       - **Percentage** – The
         percentage threshold to use. For example, suppose this
         is 12.5%. Amazon Quick Sight then identifies values as anomalous
         when the difference between a value and the expected
         value is greater than 12.5%.

    5. **Sort by** – Choose a sort method for
       your results. Some methods are based on the anomaly score that
       Amazon Quick Sight generates. Amazon Quick Sight gives higher scores to data points
       that look anomalous. You can use any of the following options:
       - **Weighted anomaly score** –
         The anomaly score multiplied by the log of the absolute
         value of the difference between the actual value and the
         expected value. This score is always a positive number.
       - **Anomaly score** – The actual
         anomaly score assigned to this data point.
       - **Weighted difference from expected
         value** – The anomaly score
         multiplied by the difference between the actual value
         and the expected value (default).
       - **Difference from expected value**
         – The actual difference between the actual value
         and the expected value (that is,
         actual−expected).
       - **Actual value** – The actual
         value with no formula applied.

6.  In the **Schedule options** section, set the schedule
    for automatically running the insight recalculation. The schedule runs
    only for published dashboards. In the analysis, you can run it manually
    as needed. Scheduling includes the following settings:
    - **Occurrence** – How often that you
      want the recalculation to run: every hour, every day, every
      week, or every month.
    - **Start schedule on** – The date and
      time to start running this schedule.
    - **Timezone** – The time zone that the
      schedule runs in. To view a list, delete the current entry.

7.  In the **Top contributors** section, set Amazon Quick Sight to
    analyze the key drivers when an outlier (anomaly) is detected.

For example, Amazon Quick Sight can show the top customers that contributed to a
spike in sales in the US for home improvement products. You can add up
to four dimensions from your dataset. These include dimensions that you
didn't add to the field wells of this insight widget.

For a list of dimensions available for contribution analysis, choose
**Select fields**. 8. Choose **Save** to confirm your choices. Choose
**Cancel** to exit without saving. 9. From the insight widget, choose **Run now** to run
the anomaly detection and view your insight.
The amount of time that anomaly detecton takes to complete varies depending on
how many unique data points you are analyzing. The process can take a few
minutes for a minimum number of points, or it can take many hours.

While it's running in the background, you can do other work in your analysis.
Make sure to wait for it to complete before you change the configuration, edit
the narrative, or open the **Explore anomalies** page for this
insight.

The insight widget needs to run at least once before you can see results. If
you think the status might be out of date, you can refresh the page. The insight
can have the following states.
