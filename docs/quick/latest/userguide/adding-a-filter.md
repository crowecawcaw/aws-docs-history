# Filtering data in Amazon Quick Sight

You can use filters to refine the data in a dataset or an analysis. For example, you can
create a filter on a region field that excludes data from a particular region in a dataset.
You can also add a filter to an analysis, such as a filter on the range of dates that you
want to include in any visuals in your analysis.

When you create a filter in a dataset, that filter applies to the entire dataset. Any
analyses and subsequent dashboards created from that dataset contains the filter. If someone
creates a dataset from your dataset, the filter also is in the new dataset.

When you create a filter in an analysis, that filter only applies to that analysis and any
dashboards you publish from it. If someone duplicates your analysis, the filter persists in
the new analysis. In analyses, you can scope filters to a single visual, some visuals, all
visuals that use this dataset, or all applicable visuals.

Also, when you create filters in an analysis, you can add a filter control to your
dashboard. For more information about filter controls, see [Adding filter controls to analysis sheets](filter-controls.md "filter-controls.md").

Each filter you create applies only to a single field. You can apply filters to both
regular and calculated fields.

There are several types of filters you can add to datasets and analyses. For more
information about the types of filters you can add, and some of their options, see [Filter types in Amazon Quick](filtering-types.md "filtering-types.md").

If you create multiple filters, all top-level filters apply together using AND. If you
group filters by adding them inside a top-level filter, the filters in the group apply using
OR.

Amazon Quick Sight applies all of the enabled filters to the field. For example, suppose that there
is one filter of `state = WA` and another filter of `sales >=
 500`. Then the dataset or analysis only contains records that meet both of those
criteria. If you disable one of these, only one filter applies.

Take care that multiple filters applied to the same field aren't mutually
exclusive.
