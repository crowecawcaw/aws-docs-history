# Human-in-the-loop task center

Human-in-the-loop (HITL) tasks enable you to incorporate human judgment at critical points in your automated processes. The Task Center provides a centralized interface for managing HITL tasks. Users can review, resolve, and track tasks that require human intervention.

## Overview

The Task center displays tasks requiring human attention and provides metrics on task processing.

### Task metrics

The dashboard shows key performance indicators:

- **Open tasks** - Total number of tasks awaiting completion
- **Critical tasks** - Count of high-priority tasks requiring attention
- **Overdue tasks** - Number of tasks past their due date

### Task details table

Each task provides comprehensive information through the following columns:

- **Title** - Brief description of what needs to be done
- **Status** - Current task state (Open, Completed, Archived)
- **Due date** - When the task should be completed (includes overdue warning)
- **Severity** - Task priority (Low, Moderate, Critical)
- **Assignee** - User or group responsible for the task
- **Creation time** - When the task was created
- **Completion time** - When the task resolution was submitted by a user

### Prerequisites

Before working with tasks, you need:

- Task permissions - Access granted through automation deployment settings
- Active automations - At least one automation with HITL tasks must be run

## Types of tasks

### Chat tasks

Interactive conversations where AI agents gather input through natural language. To participate in a chat task:

- Select the task
- Review the conversation history
- Respond to agent questions in the chat interface
- The agent will close the task once it has sufficient information

###### Note

Chat tasks are closed automatically by the AI agent. You can archive unresolvable tasks, which the agent will treat as exceptions.

### Form tasks

Tasks requiring structured input through form fields. To complete a form task:

- Select the task
- Fill in the required form fields
- Click Submit when finished

###### Note

Enable "Automatically open next task" to streamline processing multiple tasks. Use "Save as Draft" to preserve partial progress.

## Managing tasks
