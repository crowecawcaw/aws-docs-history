Use the following procedure to add filters to datasets.

**To add a filter to a dataset**

1. Open the [Quick console](https://quicksight.aws.amazon.com/).

1. From the Quick homepage, choose **Data** at left.

1. In the **Datasets** tab, choose the dataset that you want, and then choose **Edit dataset**.

1. On the data preparation page that opens, choose **Add filter** at lower left, and then choose a field that you want to filter.

   The filter is added to the **Filters** pane.

1. Choose the new filter in the pane to configure the filter. Or you can choose the three dots to the right of the new filter and choose **Edit**.

   Depending on the data type of the field, your options for configuring the filter vary. For more information about the types of filters that you can create and their configurations, see [Filter types in Amazon Quick](filtering-types.md).

1. When finished, choose **Apply**.
**Note**  
The data preview shows you the results of your combined filters only as they apply to the first 1,000 rows. If all of the first 1,000 rows are filtered out, then no rows show in the preview. This effect occurs even when rows after the first 1,000 aren't filtered out.
