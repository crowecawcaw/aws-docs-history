# Granting everyone in

your Amazon Quick Sight account access to a dashboard

Alternatively, you can share your Amazon Quick Sight dashboard with everyone in your
account. When you do this, everyone in your account can access the dashboard,
even if they weren't granted access individually and assigned permissions. They
can access the dashboard if they have a link to it (shared by you) or if it's
embedded.

Sharing the dashboard with everyone in your account doesn't affect email
reports. For example, suppose that you choose to share the dashboard with
everyone in your account. Suppose also that you choose **Send email
report to all users with access to dashboard** when setting up an
email report for the same dashboard. In this case, the email report is sent only
to people who have access to the dashboard. They receive access either through
someone explicitly sharing it with them, through groups, or through shared
folders.

###### To grant everyone in your account access to a dashboard

1. Open the published dashboard and choose **Share** at
   upper right. Then choose **Share dashboard**.
2. In the **Share dashboard** page that opens, for
   **Enable access for** at bottom left, toggle on
   **Everyone in this account**. Accounts that sign in
   with an Active Directory can't access the **Everyone in this
   account** switch. Accounts that use Active Directory can
   enable this setting with an `UpdateDashboardPermissions` API
   call. For more information on `UpdateDashboardPermissions`,
   see [UpdateDashboardPermissions](../../../quicksight/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateDashboardPermissions.md "../../../quicksight/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateDashboardPermissions.md") in the _Amazon Quick Sight API
   Reference_.
3. (Optional) Toggle on **Discoverable in
   Quick Sight**.

When you share a dashboard with everyone in the account, owners can
also choose to make the dashboard discoverable in Quick Sight. A
dashboard that's discoverable appears in everyone's list of dashboards
on the **Dashboards** page. When this option is turned
on, everyone in the account can see and search for the dashboard. When
this option is turned off, they can only access the dashboard if they
have a link or if it's embedded. The dashboard doesn't appear on the
**Dashboards** page, and users can't search for
it.
