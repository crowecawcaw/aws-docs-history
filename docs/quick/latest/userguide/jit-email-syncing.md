###### Note

IAM identity federation doesn't support syncing identity provider groups
with Amazon Quick.

In Amazon Quick Enterprise edition, as an administrator you can restrict new users
from using personal email addresses when provisioning through their identity provider
(IdP) directly to Quick. Quick then uses the preconfigured email
addresses passed through the IdP when provisioning new users to your account. For
example, you can make it so that only corporate-assigned email addresses are used when
users are provisioned to your Amazon Quick account through your IdP.

###### Note

Make sure that your users are federating directly to Amazon Quick through their
IdP. Federating to the AWS Management Console through their IdP and then clicking into
Amazon Quick results in an error and they won't be able to access
Amazon Quick.

When you configure email syncing for federated users in Amazon Quick, users who log in
to your Amazon Quick account for the first time have preassigned email addresses. These
are used to register their accounts. With this approach, users can manually bypass by
entering an email address. Also, users can't use an email address that might differ from
the email address prescribed by you, the administrator.

Amazon Quick supports provisioning through an IdP that supports SAML or OpenID Connect
(OIDC) authentication. To configure email addresses for new users when provisioning
through an IdP, you update the trust relationship for the IAM role that they use with
`AssumeRoleWithSAML` or `AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity`. Then you
add a SAML attribute or OIDC token in their IdP. Last, you turn on email syncing for
federated users in Amazon Quick.

The following procedures describe these steps in detail.

## Step 1: Update the trust relationship for

the IAM role with AssumeRoleWithSAML or
AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity

You can configure email addresses for your users to use when provisioning through
your IdP to Amazon Quick. To do this, add the `sts:TagSession` action to
the trust relationship for the IAM role that you use with
`AssumeRoleWithSAML` or `AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity`. By
doing this, you can pass in `principal` tags when users assume the
role.

The following example illustrates an updated IAM role where the IdP is Okta. To
use this example, update the `Federated` Amazon Resource Name (ARN) with
the ARN for your service provider. You can replace items in red with your AWS and
IdP service-specific information.

```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17"		 	 	 ,
    "Statement": [
    {
        "Effect": "Allow",
        "Principal": {
        "Federated": "arn:aws:iam::`account-id`:`saml-provider`/`Okta`"
        },
        "Action": "sts:AssumeRoleWithSAML",
        "Condition": {
        "StringEquals": {
            "SAML:aud": "https://signin.aws.amazon.com/saml"
        }
        }
    },
    {
        "Effect": "Allow",
        "Principal": {
        "Federated": "arn:aws:iam::`account-id`:`saml-provider`/`Okta`"
        },
        "Action": "sts:TagSession",
        "Condition": {
        "StringLike": {
            "aws:RequestTag/Email": "*"
        }
        }
    }
    ]
    }
```

## Step 2: Add a SAML attribute or OIDC

token for the IAM principal tag in your IdP

After you update the trust relationship for the IAM role as described in the
preceding section, add a SAML attribute or OIDC token for the IAM
`Principal` tag in your IdP.

The following examples illustrate a SAML attribute and an OIDC token. To use these
examples, replace the email address with a variable in your IdP that points to a
user's email address. You can replace items highlighted in red with your
information.

- **SAML attribute**: The following example
  illustrates a SAML attribute.

```
<Attribute Name="https://aws.amazon.com/SAML/Attributes/PrincipalTag:Email"><AttributeValue>`john.doe@example.com`</AttributeValue></Attribute>
```

###### Note

If you're using Okta as your IdP, make sure to turn on a feature flag
in your Okta user account to use SAML. For more information, see [Okta and AWS Partner to Simplify Access Via Session Tags](https://www.okta.com/blog/2019/11/okta-and-aws-partner-to-simplify-access-via-session-tags/ "https://www.okta.com/blog/2019/11/okta-and-aws-partner-to-simplify-access-via-session-tags/")
on the Okta blog.

- **OIDC token**: The following example
  illustrates an OIDC token example.

```
"https://aws.amazon.com/tags": {"principal_tags": {"Email": ["`john.doe@example.com`"]
```

## Step 3: Turn on email syncing for

federated users in Amazon Quick

As described preceding, update the trust relationship for the IAM role and add a
SAML attribute or OIDC token for the IAM `Principal` tag in your IdP.
Then turn on email syncing for federated users in Amazon Quick as described in the
following procedure.

###### To turn on email syncing for federated users

1. From any page in Amazon Quick, choose your username at top right, and then
   choose **Manage Amazon Quick**.
2. Choose **Single sign-on (IAM federation)** in the menu
   at left.
3. On the **Service Provider Initiated IAM federation**
   page, for **Email Syncing for Federated Users**, choose
   **ON**.

When email syncing for federated users is on, Amazon Quick uses the email
addresses that you configured in steps 1 and 2 when provisioning new users
to your account. Users can't enter their own email addresses.

When email syncing for federated users is off, Amazon Quick asks users to
input their email address manually when provisioning new users to your
account. They can use any email addresses that they want.
