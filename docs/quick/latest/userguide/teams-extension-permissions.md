<a name="teams-extension-permissions"></a>

The Amazon Quick Microsoft Teams extension uses Microsoft's Resource-Specific Consent (RSC) framework. The bot only gets access to the specific meetings and chats where it is installed — not tenant-wide access to all Teams data. These permissions are granted automatically when the app is added to a meeting or chat; no additional admin action is needed.

The following table lists the RSC permissions used by the Teams extension.


| Permission | Purpose | Feature | 
| --- | --- | --- | 
| ChatMessage.Read.Chat | Read chat messages for AI assistant context | General chat assistant | 
| ChatMember.Read.Chat | Resolve attendee emails and identify the meeting organizer for summary delivery | Meeting Summary | 
| OnlineMeeting.ReadBasic.Chat | Read meeting name, schedule, and organizer info | Meeting Summary | 
| OnlineMeetingTranscript.Read.Chat | Retrieve transcripts after a meeting ends | Meeting Summary | 
| OnlineMeetingParticipant.Read.Chat | Read participant join/leave times and roles | Meeting Summary | 
| ChannelMessage.Read.Group | Read thread context when the bot is @mentioned in a channel | General chat assistant | 
| ChannelMeeting.ReadBasic.Group | Read basic properties of channel meetings | Meeting Summary | 
| ChannelMeetingTranscript.Read.Group | Retrieve transcripts of channel meetings | Meeting Summary | 
| ChannelMeetingParticipant.Read.Group | Read participant info for channel meetings | Meeting Summary |
