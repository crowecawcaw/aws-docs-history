<a name="table-sort-off-visual"></a>

Quick authors can configure an off-visual sort to sort the values in a table by a field and aggregation that is a part of the dataset that the table uses but not in one of the table's field wells. One off-field sort can be configured to a single table at a time.

Use the procedure below to configure an off-visual sort.

**To add an off-visual sort to a table**

1. Open the [Quick console](https://quicksight.aws.amazon.com/).

1. Open the analysis that you want to work in and navigate to the table that you want to sort.

1. Choose the header of any column in the table.

1. For **Sort by**, choose the arrow icon, and then choose **Off-visual field**.

1. In the **Off-visual field** pane that appears, open the **Sort by** dropdown menu and choose the field that you want to sort.

1. For **Aggregation** open the dropdown menu and choose the aggregation that you want to use.

1. For **Sort order**, choose if you want the sort to be in an ascending or descending order.

1. When you are finished, choose **Apply**.

After a off-visual sort is applied to a table, the sort is shown in the **Sort visual** menu. The sort order of a table that contains an off-visual sort depends on the sort configuration of the table when the off-visual sort is added. If an off-visual sort is added to a table that already has a single or multi column sort configured, the off-visual sort overrides all other sorts. If the off-visual sort is applied before single or multi column sorts, you can add and reorder more sorts to the table.
