  For a VPC data source to be accessed from Amazon Quick Sight, the following statements must be true
  of your configuration:

1. The Domain Name System (DNS) name of the VPC data source can be resolved from
   outside of your VPC.
2. The connection returns the private IP address of your instance. Databases hosted
   by Amazon Redshift, Amazon RDS, and Aurora automatically meet this requirement.
3. There is a clearly defined network path from the data source to Amazon Quick Sight.
4. You registered the VPC with Amazon Quick by creating or using a VPC connection
   with the Amazon Quick console.
