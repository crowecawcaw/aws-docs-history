# ServiceNow integration

Use the ServiceNow integration to perform actions within your ServiceNow instances,
including managing incidents, problems, change requests, knowledge base articles, and
attachments. This integration uses the ServiceNow REST API. For more information, see
[REST API](https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/xanadu-api-reference/page/build/applications/concept/api-rest.html "https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/xanadu-api-reference/page/build/applications/concept/api-rest.html") in the ServiceNow documentation.

Setting up this integration involves two steps. First, you configure an OAuth
application in your ServiceNow instance. Then, you create the integration in
Amazon Quick and connect it to your ServiceNow app. For information about the
authentication methods that Amazon Quick supports, see [Authentication methods](quick-action-auth.md "quick-action-auth.md").

## Before you begin

Before you set up the integration, verify that you have the following.

- A ServiceNow instance. This integration is validated against the
  Xanadu release.
- A ServiceNow user account with permissions to create OAuth
  applications (`admin` role required).
- For service authentication (client credentials), your instance must
  be running the Washington DC release or later.
- For subscription requirements, see [Set up integrations in the console](integration-console-setup-process.md "integration-console-setup-process.md").

## Configure ServiceNow OAuth

Before you configure Amazon Quick, create an OAuth application endpoint in
your ServiceNow instance. Complete all of the following steps in ServiceNow
before moving to the Amazon Quick console.

For more information, see [Create an endpoint for clients to access the instance](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/bundle/xanadu-platform-security/page/administer/security/task/t_CreateEndpointforExternalClients.html "https://www.servicenow.com/docs/bundle/xanadu-platform-security/page/administer/security/task/t_CreateEndpointforExternalClients.html") in the
ServiceNow documentation.

### Register the OAuth application

To register the OAuth application, complete the following steps.

1. In your ServiceNow instance, navigate to **All**
   > **System OAuth** > **Application
   > Registry** and choose
   > **New**.
2. Choose **Create an OAuth API endpoint for external
   clients**.
3. Complete the form:
   - **Name** – A descriptive name for the
     OAuth application.
   - **Redirect URL** –
     `https://`{region}`.quicksight.aws.amazon.com/sn/oauthcallback`

   Replace `{region}` with your
   AWS Region (for example,
   `us-east-1`).

4. Choose **Submit**.
5. Reopen the application registry entry and choose the lock icon
   next to **Client Secret** to reveal the
   value.
6. Copy the **Client ID** and **Client
   Secret** values. You need these when you configure the
   integration in Amazon Quick.

### Additional steps for service authentication (client credentials)

If you plan to use service authentication, complete these additional
steps after registering the OAuth application. The client credentials grant
type was introduced in the ServiceNow Washington DC release. For more
information, see [Up Your OAuth2.0 Game: Inbound Client Credentials with Washington
DC](https://www.servicenow.com/community/developer-blog/up-your-oauth2-0-game-inbound-client-credentials-with-washington/ba-p/2816891 "https://www.servicenow.com/community/developer-blog/up-your-oauth2-0-game-inbound-client-credentials-with-washington/ba-p/2816891") in the ServiceNow Community.

1. Enable the client credentials grant type. Navigate to
   `sys_properties.list` using the filter navigator and
   create a new system property with the following values:
   - **Name** –
     `glide.oauth.inbound.client.credential.grant_type.enabled`
   - **Type** – `true |
false`
   - **Value** –
     `true`

2. Verify that the following plugins are installed (navigate to
   **Admin** > **Application
   Manager**):
   - OAuth 2.0
     (`com.snc.platform.security.oauth`)
   - REST API Provider
     (`com.glide.rest`)
   - Authentication scope
     (`com.glide.auth.scope`)
   - REST API Auth Scope Plugin
     (`com.glide.rest.auth.scope`)

3. Return to your OAuth application in **System
   OAuth** > **Application
   Registry**. Add the **OAuth Application
   User** field to the form if it isn't visible (use
   **Configure** > **Form
   Builder** to add it).
4. Set the **OAuth Application User** to an
   appropriately permissioned user, such as a user with the System
   Administrator role.

###### Important

With service authentication, all actions execute as the configured
OAuth application user. Any Amazon Quick user with access to this
integration can perform actions using that account's permissions. Configure
the account permissions to match your organization's security
requirements.

## Set up the integration in Amazon Quick

After you complete the ServiceNow OAuth configuration, create the integration
in Amazon Quick.

1. In the Amazon Quick console, choose
   **Integrations**.
2. Choose **ServiceNow** and choose the Add (plus "+")
   button.
3. Enter the integration details:
   - **Name** – Descriptive name for your
     ServiceNow integration.
   - **Description** (Optional) – Purpose of the
     integration.

4. Choose your connection type and fill in the connection
   settings:
   1. For **User authentication
      (OAuth)**, configure the following fields:
      - **Base URL** –
        `https://`{your-instance}`.service-now.com`
      - **Client ID** – Client ID from your
        ServiceNow OAuth application.
      - **Client Secret** – Client secret
        from your ServiceNow OAuth application.
      - **Token URL** –
        `https://`{your-instance}`.service-now.com/oauth_token.do`
      - **Auth URL** –
        `https://`{your-instance}`.service-now.com/oauth_auth.do`
      - **Redirect URL** –
        `https://`{region}`.quicksight.aws.amazon.com/sn/oauthcallback`

   2. For **Service authentication (client
      credentials)**, configure the following
      fields:
      - **Authentication type** –
        Service-to-service OAuth
      - **Base URL** –
        `https://`{your-instance}`.service-now.com`
      - **Client ID** – Client ID from your
        ServiceNow OAuth application.
      - **Client Secret** – Client secret
        from your ServiceNow OAuth application.
      - **Token URL** –
        `https://`{your-instance}`.service-now.com/oauth_token.do`

5. Choose **Create and continue**.
6. Choose users to share the integration with.
7. Choose **Next**.

For user authentication, navigate to **Integrations** >
**Actions** > your ServiceNow integration name, and choose
**Sign in** to complete the OAuth authorization
flow.

## Available actions

After you set up the integration, the following actions are available.

###### Note

The specific actions available depend on the permissions configured in
your ServiceNow instance and the authentication method used.

## Limitations

This integration interacts with ServiceNow through the REST API, which does
not enforce UI policies, UI actions, or client scripts. These rules only apply
in the ServiceNow browser interface. Server-side business rules, ACLs, and data
policies are enforced. For more information, see [REST API](https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/xanadu-api-reference/page/integrate/inbound-rest/concept/c_RESTAPI.html "https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/xanadu-api-reference/page/integrate/inbound-rest/concept/c_RESTAPI.html") in the ServiceNow documentation.

## Manage and troubleshoot

To edit, share, or delete your integration, see [Managing existing integrations](integration-workflows.md#managing-existing-integrations "integration-workflows.md#managing-existing-integrations").

### Authentication issues

- **OAuth authorization fails** –
  Verify that the Client ID and Client Secret match the values in
  your ServiceNow Application Registry. Confirm the Redirect URL in
  ServiceNow matches the URL in your Amazon Quick configuration
  exactly.
- **Service authentication fails** –
  Verify that the
  `glide.oauth.inbound.client.credential.grant_type.enabled`
  system property is set to `true`. Confirm the
  **OAuth Application User** field is populated
  on the application registry record.

### Common error messages

- **Actions return permission
  errors** – Verify that the ServiceNow user or OAuth
  application user has the required roles to access the target tables
  (for example, `itil` role for incident
  management).
- **Connection timeout or unreachable
  instance** – Verify the Base URL uses the correct
  ServiceNow instance name. Confirm the ServiceNow instance is
  accessible and not in maintenance mode.
