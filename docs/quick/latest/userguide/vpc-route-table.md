<a name="vpc-route-table"></a>

To use VPC peering or Direct Connect to reach an on-premises database instance, update the route table that's associated with the VPC you're using with Amazon Quick. For more information on route tables, see [Route tables](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_Route_Tables.html) in the *Amazon VPC User Guide.*

To learn more about VPC peering and view sample scenarios and configurations, see [What is VPC peering?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/peering/what-is-vpc-peering.html) in the *Amazon VPC Peering Guide.* For an example configuration, see [Example: Services using AWS PrivateLink and VPC peering](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-peer-region-example.html) in the *Amazon VPC User Guide.*

**Using the AWS CLI**

The following example creates a route table.

```
aws ec2 create-route-table --vpc-id {{vpc-0daeb67adda59e0cd}}
```

Then you can use the `create-route` command to create a route. For more information and examples, see [create-route](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/create-route.html) in the *AWS CLI Command Reference.*

For the following examples to work, make sure that you have a subnet in the VPC associated with the route table. The first example describes the route table with the specified VPC ID. The second one describes the route table with the specified route table ID. 

```
aws ec2 describe-route-tables \
--filters "Name=vpc-id,Values={{vpc-0daeb67adda59e0cd}}" 

aws ec2 describe-route-tables \
--route-table-ids {{rtb-45ac473a}}
```

The following example describes the specified associations between a specific VPC and your local gateway route tables.

```
aws ec2 describe-local-gateway-route-table-vpc-associations
--filters "Name=vpc-id,Values={{vpc-0daeb67adda59e0cd}}"
```
