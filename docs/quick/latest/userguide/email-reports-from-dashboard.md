# Configuring email report settings for

a Quick Sight dashboard

|                                            |

| \*_Applies<br>to:_<br>• Enterprise Edition |

In Amazon Quick Enterprise edition, you can email a report from any sheet in a
dashboard. You can send reports from interactive dashboards and pixel perfect report
sheets. Schedules include settings for when to send them, the contents to include,
and who receives the email. You can view a sample report and a list of the datasets
used in the report. To set up or change the schedule sent from a dashboard, make
sure that you're an owner or co-owner of the dashboard.

If you have access to the dashboard, you can change your subscription options by
opening your view of the dashboard. For more information on how this works, see
[Subscribing to email reports in Amazon Quick Sight](subscribing-to-reports.md "subscribing-to-reports.md").

Scheduling options that are available for an email report include the
following:

- **Once (Does not repeat)** – Sends the report only
  once at the date and time that you choose.
- **Daily** – Repeats daily at the time that you
  choose.
- **Weekly** – Repeats each week on the same day or
  days at the time that you choose. You can also use this option to send
  reports in weekly intervals, such as every other week or every three
  weeks.
- **Monthly** – Repeats each month on the same day
  of the month at the time that you choose. You can also use this option to
  send reports on specific days of the month, such as the second Wednesday or
  the last Friday of each month.
- **Yearly** – Repeats each year on the same day of
  the month or months selected at the time that you choose. You can also use
  this option to send reports on specific days or sets of days in selected
  months. For example, you can configure a report to be sent on the first
  Monday of January, March, and September, or on July 14th, or on the second
  day of February, April, and June each year.
- **Custom** – Configure your own scheduled report
  that best fits your business needs.
  You can customize the title of the report, the optional email subject, and the
  body text.

Although you can configure the report so that everyone who has access receives a
copy, this is not usually the best plan. We recommend limiting automated emails,
especially those sent to groups. You can start with a small number of subscribers by
choosing specific people from the access list. Verify your company's policy before
subscribing anyone to a subscription.

You can directly add people to a report subscription in these ways:

- (Recommended) Choose recipients from the provided access list to specify
  and maintain a list of people who you want to email reports to. You can use
  the search box to find people by email or group name.
- To send reports to all of the dashboard's subscribers, choose
  **Send email report to all users with access to
  dashboard** when prompted.
  Anyone else who wants to get the emails can open the dashboard and set their own
  subscription options to either opt in or opt out.

###### Important

When you share the dashboard with new Quick user names or groups,
they automatically start receiving the email reports. If you don't want this to
happen, you need to edit the report settings each time you add people to the
dashboard.

For existing email schedules, you can pause the schedule in Amazon Quick Sight while you make
changes. In the **Schedules** pane, you can pause or resume a
scheduled report with the toggle that appears under each report. Pausing a report
does not delete the report's schedule from Quick Sight.

If your report includes custom visuals, be aware that you can't include images
from a private network in an email report, even if you can access the images. If you
want to include an image, use a publicly available one.

Before you begin, make sure that you are using Amazon Quick Enterprise edition and
that you have shared the dashboard with intended recipients.

     sign in before the report starts to download. The link expires one
     year after the report is sent.
