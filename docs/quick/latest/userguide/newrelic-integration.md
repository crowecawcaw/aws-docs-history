# New Relic integration
<a name="newrelic-integration"></a>

With the New Relic connector, you can access the New Relic observability platform directly in Amazon Quick through natural language. You can investigate incidents, analyze application performance, query telemetry data, and generate reports without leaving Amazon Quick.

New Relic is available as a built-in connector in Amazon Quick. To set up this integration, complete the following two steps. First, prepare your New Relic account with the required access. Then, create the integration in Amazon Quick and authenticate with your New Relic credentials. This integration uses OAuth 2.0 user authentication. For information about the authentication methods that Amazon Quick supports, see [Authentication methods](quick-action-auth.md).

## Prerequisites
<a name="newrelic-integration-prerequisites"></a>

Before you set up the integration, make sure that you have the following resources and access.
+ An active New Relic account with the required permissions and access. For information about account requirements and access configuration, see [New Relic AI MCP](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/agentic-ai/mcp/overview/) in the New Relic documentation.
+ For information about subscription requirements, see [Set up integrations in the console](integration-console-setup-process.md).

## Verify your New Relic account
<a name="newrelic-account-setup"></a>

Before you configure Amazon Quick, verify that your New Relic account meets the following requirements.
+ Your New Relic account is active and you can sign in to [login.newrelic.com](https://login.newrelic.com).
+ The entities and data that you want to query are accessible to your account.

## Set up the integration in Amazon Quick
<a name="newrelic-integration-setup"></a>

After you verify your New Relic account access, create the integration in Amazon Quick.

1. In the Amazon Quick console, choose **Connectors**.

1. Choose the **Create for your team** tab.

1. Find and choose **New Relic**.

1. In the **Create integration** dialog, enter the following fields:
   + **Name** – A descriptive name for your New Relic integration.
   + **Description** (Optional) – Notes about how you plan to use this connection.
   + **Connection type** – Choose **Public network**.

1. Choose **Create and continue**.

1. On the integration detail page, choose **Sign in** and authenticate with your New Relic account credentials. This step authorizes Amazon Quick to access New Relic on behalf of the authenticated user.

1. (Optional) Choose the users to share the integration with.

1. Choose **Done**.

The integration appears in the **Existing actions** panel with a status of **Available**.

| Entities | List Entity Types | Lists the complete catalog of New Relic entity types with their domain, type, and metric definitions. | 
| Alerts | List Alert Policies | Lists alert policies for a specified account, with optional filtering by policy name. | 
| Alerts | List Alert Conditions | Retrieves alert condition details for a specific alert policy. | 
| Dashboards | List Dashboards | Lists all dashboards for a New Relic account. | 
| Dashboards | Get Dashboard | Retrieves detailed information for a specific dashboard by entity GUID. | 
| Change tracking | List Change Events | Retrieves a history of change events such as deployments, configuration changes, and other tracked activities for an entity. | 
| Monitoring | List Synthetic Monitors | Lists synthetic monitors that check service availability and performance from multiple geographic locations. | 
| Account | List Available New Relic Accounts | Lists all New Relic account IDs that are accessible to the authenticated user. | 
| Utilities | Convert Time Period to Epoch Ms | Converts a natural language time period to epoch milliseconds for use with time-based queries. | 

**Note**  
The actions that you can use depend on the permissions that are configured in your New Relic account and the entities that are accessible to the authenticated user.

## Manage and troubleshoot

To edit, share, or delete your integration, see [Managing existing integrations](integration-workflows.md#managing-existing-integrations).

### Authentication issues
<a name="newrelic-troubleshooting-auth"></a>
+ **Sign-in fails** – Verify that your New Relic account is active and that you can sign in to [login.newrelic.com](https://login.newrelic.com) directly. If your organization uses single sign-on (SSO), confirm that your identity provider is configured correctly.
+ **MCP server access denied** – Verify that your user has the required permissions to access the New Relic MCP server. For information about access requirements, see [New Relic AI MCP](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/agentic-ai/mcp/overview/) in the New Relic documentation.
