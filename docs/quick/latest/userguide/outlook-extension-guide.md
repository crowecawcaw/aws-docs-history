# Amazon Quick Microsoft Outlook extension

The Amazon Quick extension for Outlook helps you manage your entire
inbox using natural language. You can summarize unread messages, organize your inbox,
schedule meetings, and draft responses, all without leaving Outlook.

You can search for Amazon Quick in the Microsoft Outlook app store
or visit the [Quick
for Outlook Microsoft store page](https://marketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/product/WA200010695 "https://marketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/product/WA200010695") to add the extension.

Key capabilities include:

- **Inbox management:** Summarize and prioritize
  your unread emails, search for specific emails or discussions using natural
  language queries, and organize your inbox by moving emails to folders, flagging
  messages for follow-up, and more.
- **Calendar and meeting management:** Summarize
  your calendar, find optimal meeting times with coworkers, and schedule meetings
  using natural language instructions.
- **Email summaries and replies:** Open the
  Quick side panel to ask questions about an email thread in focus
  or generate a contextual reply.
- **Enterprise knowledge integration:** Use
  Quick's knowledge sources to draft contextual responses to emails
  or to perform inbox and calendar tasks.
- **External actions:** Perform actions in
  third-party applications using your configured [connectors](../../../quicksuite/latest/userguide/action-connectors.md "../../../quicksuite/latest/userguide/action-connectors.md") or apps directly from
  Outlook.

###### Important

- The Amazon Quick Outlook extension uses generative AI to
  create and execute code within your Outlook application
  sandbox. AI can make mistakes and perform inaccurate actions within your
  Outlook mailbox. No email or content is read when the side
  panel is closed, and no data is sent to Amazon Quick unless you explicitly
  send a prompt.
- Amazon Quick does not use your user data for service improvement or for
  training its underlying large language models (LLMs).

###### Note

Some features, such as inbox prioritization, calendar management, and email
organization, require Microsoft Graph API permissions that must be
granted by your administrator. If you are unable to perform these tasks, contact
your administrator to ensure the required Graph API permissions have been approved
for your organization. For more information, see [Microsoft Outlook extension permissions](outlook-extension.md#outlook-permissions "outlook-extension.md#outlook-permissions") in the admin guide.

## Amazon Quick Microsoft Outlook extension usage guidelines

As a user, you are responsible for keeping company information safe. The
following guidance helps you use Amazon Quick apps securely while maintaining
data privacy and compliance.

### Conversation retention and accuracy

Each conversation is stored for 30 days. You can review and manage your
conversation history by choosing the conversation history button in the
Outlook extension.

Amazon Quick uses generative AI. You should review responses for
accuracy.

Usage of the Amazon Quick extension for Microsoft Outlook is
subject to the [AWS Responsible AI Policy](https://aws.amazon.com/ai/responsible-ai/policy/ "https://aws.amazon.com/ai/responsible-ai/policy/").

### Security considerations

When you use Amazon Quick with email content, remember that responses
reflect individual user permissions and content may include information not
accessible to all email recipients. It may generate responses that contain
sensitive data that can't be publicly shared.

To protect your organization's data, carefully evaluate email usage and
plan deployment with data privacy in mind. Amazon Quick maintains strict
data privacy by not using customer data for service improvements, not using
customer data to enhance language models, and not indexing Microsoft
Outlook conversations into your company's Amazon Quick
instance.

## Sample prompts

The following prompts demonstrate common ways to use Quick within
Outlook. You can adapt these to your specific needs.

- "Summarize all unread emails and highlight any that need urgent
  responses today."
- "Draft a follow-up email to [contact name] referencing the key points
  from this thread."
- "Schedule a 30-minute meeting with the contacts in this email thread
  for next week."
- "Find all emails discussing [project name] and create a summary of
  action items."
- "Using data from my Quick space, draft a status update
  email for the leadership team on our quarterly metrics."

###### Tip

For best results, be specific in your prompts. Include names, dates, and
goals. You can also reference your Quick spaces, dashboards, and
knowledge bases for personalized results.
