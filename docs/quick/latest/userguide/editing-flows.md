## Prompt writing for steps

When writing prompts for steps, consider the following best practices:

- Be clear and specific about what you want the model to generate.
- Provide context to help the model understand the task.
- Specify the desired format, tone, and style of the output.
- Use specific language to control the output — for example, "respond in bullet points", "limit the response to three sentences", or "use a formal tone".
- Use examples to illustrate the expected output when appropriate.

## Adding and removing steps

### Adding steps

1. In the Flow editor, choose **Add step** from the toolbar.
2. Select the type of step you want to add.
3. Drag the step to the desired position in your flow.
4. Configure the step as needed.

### Removing steps

1. Select the step you want to remove.
2. Choose **Delete** from the context menu.
3. Confirm the deletion when prompted.

###### Note

When you remove a step, any @ references to that step in other steps are also removed. You may need to update other steps to maintain your flow.

## Publishing changes

After making changes to your flow, publish them to make them available to users.

1. In the Flow editor, choose **Save** to save your changes.
2. Choose **Publish**.
3. Choose **Publish** to confirm.

When you publish, the changes become immediately available to all users who have access to the flow.

## Updating Flow details

### Updating title and description

1. In the Flow editor, directly edit the title and description in-line.
2. Choose **Save**.
3. Choose **Publish**.

### Viewing the original prompt

If your flow was created using a natural language prompt, you can view the original prompt:

1. In the Flow editor, select the kebab menu in the header.
2. Choose **View prompt**.

###### Note

The original prompt is read-only. To create a new flow based on a modified prompt, use the natural language prompt method.

## Best practices for editing flows

- Test your changes thoroughly before publishing them to ensure they work as expected.
- Use clear and descriptive names for steps to make your flow easier to understand and maintain.
- Write detailed prompts and instructions to get the best results from AI models.
- Use @ references to create dynamic flows that adapt to user inputs.
- Consider the user experience when designing the flow of steps.
- Document your changes in the publication description to maintain a clear history of updates.

Step configurations and available features may change over time.
