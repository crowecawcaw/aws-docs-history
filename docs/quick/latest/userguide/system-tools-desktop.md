# System tools
<a name="system-tools-desktop"></a>

The Amazon Quick desktop application includes built-in system tools that provide core capabilities such as web search, file operations, browser automation, image generation, and more. You can individually enable or disable each system tool and configure granular permission controls that determine how much access Quick has for each operation.

You manage system tools in **Settings** > **Capabilities** > **Tools**.

## Managing system tool permissions
<a name="system-tools-permissions"></a>

Each system tool has a toggle to enable or disable it and a **Manage permissions** button that opens a detailed permission panel.

### Access levels
<a name="system-tools-access-levels"></a>

When you choose **Manage permissions** on a system tool, you can set one of the following three access levels.


| Access level | Description | 
| --- | --- | 
| Full Access (Read & write) | Quick has full read and write access to this capability. Operations run without prompting you for confirmation. | 
| Read Only (View only) | Quick can perform read operations but cannot modify, write, or delete data through this tool. | 
| Ask Each Time (Confirm all) | Quick asks for your confirmation before performing any operation with this tool. | 

### Per-operation permissions
<a name="system-tools-per-operation"></a>

Below the access level, each tool lists its individual operations grouped into **Read Operations** and **Write Operations** (where applicable). Each operation has its own permission dropdown that you can set independently. For example, you might set the overall access level to **Full Access** but restrict a specific write operation to **Ask Each Time**.

Browser Automation supports the following two modes of operation.
+ **Default mode** – Quick launches a separate Chrome instance with a copy of your Chrome profile. This preserves your saved logins and cookies while keeping the automation session isolated from your main browser.

### Code Execution
<a name="system-tool-code-execution"></a>

Code Execution enables Quick to write and run Python code in a sandboxed environment on your machine. Quick uses this capability for data analysis, calculations, file processing, chart generation, and automation tasks.

Code Execution has the following key characteristics.
+ Code runs in an **OS-level sandbox** (macOS Seatbelt or Windows AppContainer) for security.
**Note**  
The sandbox also has access to the system temporary directories regardless of your folder permission settings. On Windows, these are `C:\TEMP`, `C:\TMP`, `\TEMP`, and `\TMP`. On macOS and Linux, these are `/tmp`, `/var/tmp`, and `/usr/tmp`.
+ A **persistent namespace** is maintained across code runs within a conversation, so variables and functions carry over.
+ Pre-installed Python packages are available. Package installation (`pip install`) is not supported within the sandbox.
+ File access within the sandbox follows the same folder permissions you configure in **Settings** > **My computer**. In addition, the sandbox always has access to system temporary directories. On Windows, these are `C:\TEMP`, `C:\TMP`, `\TEMP`, and `\TMP`. On macOS and Linux, these are `/tmp`, `/var/tmp`, and `/usr/tmp`.


| Operation | Type | Description | 
| --- | --- | --- | 
| Execute code | Write | Run Python code and return the output. | 

**When to use** – Enable this tool when you want Quick to perform calculations, analyze data, generate charts, process files, or automate tasks using Python.

### Engram Builder
<a name="system-tool-engram-builder"></a>

| Get engram | Read | Retrieve a saved personality engram. | 
| List engrams | Read | List all available personality engrams. |
