# Inbound endpoints for Amazon Route 53 Resolver
<a name="vpc-route-53"></a>

*Amazon Route 53 Resolver* provides DNS query capabilities to your VPC. Route 53 Resolver resolves all local DNS queries and recursively looks up any DNS queries that aren't local on public DNS servers. 

Amazon Quick can't directly use Route 53 Resolver to query private DNS servers. However, you can set up Route 53 Resolver inbound endpoints to make these queries indirectly. For more information about inbound endpoints, see [Forwarding inbound DNS queries to your VPCs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/resolver-forwarding-inbound-queries.html) in the *Route 53 Resolver Developer Guide*. To use inbound endpoints in Amazon Quick, provide the IP addresses of the endpoints for **DNS resolver endpoints** when you create a VPC connection.
