# Creating a data source

| Intended audience:<br>Amazon Quick authors |

As an analysis author in Amazon Quick, you don't need to understand anything about
the infrastructure that you use to connect to your data. You set up a new data
source only once.

After a data source is set up, you can access it from its tile in the
Quick console. You can use it to create one or more datasets. After a
dataset is set up, you can also access the dataset from its tile. By abstracting
away the technical details, Amazon Quick Sight simplifies data connections.

###### Note

You don't need to store connection settings for files that you plan to upload
manually. For more information about file uploads, see [Creating datasets](creating-data-sets.md "creating-data-sets.md").

Before you begin adding a new data-source connection profile to Amazon Quick,
first collect the information that you need to connect to the data source. In some
cases, you might plan to copy and paste settings from a file. If so, make sure that
the file doesn't contain formatting characters (list bullets or numbers) or blank
space characters (spaces, tabs). Also make sure that the file doesn't contain
nontext "gremlin" characters such as non-ASCII, null (ASCII 0), and
control characters.

The following list includes the information to collect the most commonly used
settings:

- The data source to connect to.

Make sure that you know which source that you need to connect to for
reporting. This source might be different than the source that stores,
processes, or provides access to the data.

For example, let's say that you're a new analyst in a large company.
You want to analyze data from your ordering system, which you know uses
Oracle. However, you can't directly query the online transaction processing
(OLTP) data. A subset of data is extracted and stored in a bucket on Amazon S3,
but you don't have access to that either. Your new co-workers explain that
they use AWS Glue crawlers to read the files and AWS Lake Formation to access them. With
more research, you learn that you need to use an Amazon Athena query as your
data source in Amazon Quick Sight. The point here is that it isn't always obvious
which type of data source to choose.

- A descriptive name for the new data source tile.

Each new data source connection needs a unique and descriptive name. This
name displays on the Amazon Quick Sight list of existing data sources, which is at the
bottom of the **Create a Data Set** screen. Use a name that
makes it easy to distinguish your data sources from other similar data
sources. Your new Amazon Quick Sight data source profile displays both the database
software logo and the custom name that you assign.

- The name of the server or instance to connect to.

A unique name or other identifier identifies the server connector of the
data source on your network. The descriptors vary depending on which one
you're connecting to, but it's usually one or more of the following:

    + Hostname
    + IP address
    + Cluster ID
    + Instance ID
    + Connector
    + Site-based URL

- The name of the collection of data that you want to use.

The descriptor varies depending on the data source, but it's usually one
of the following:

    + Database
    + Warehouse
    + S3 bucket
    + Catalog
    + Schema

In some cases, you might need to include a manifest file or a query.

- The user name that you want Amazon Quick Sight to use.

Every time Amazon Quick Sight connects using this data source profile (tile), it uses
the user name from the connection settings. In some cases, this might be
your personal login. But if you're going to share this with other people,
ask the system administrator about creating credentials to use for Amazon Quick Sight
connections.

- What type of connection to use. You can choose a public network or a VPC
  connection. If you have more than one VPC connection available, identify
  which one to use to reach your source of data.
- Additional settings, such as Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) or API tokens, are
  required by some data sources.
  After you save the connection settings as a data source profile, you can create a
  dataset by selecting its tile. The connections are stored as data source connection
  profiles in Amazon Quick Sight.

To view your existing connection profiles, open the Quick start page,
choose **Data**, choose **Create**, and then
choose **New Dataset**.

For a list of supported data source connections and examples, see [Connect to your data with integrations and
datasets](connecting-to-data-examples.md "connecting-to-data-examples.md").

After you create a data source in Quick Sight, you can [create a
dataset](../../../quicksuite/latest/userguide/creating-data-sets.md "../../../quicksuite/latest/userguide/creating-data-sets.md") in Quick Sight that contains data from the connected data
source. You can also [update data source
connection](../../../quicksuite/latest/userguide/edit-a-data-source.md "../../../quicksuite/latest/userguide/edit-a-data-source.md") information at any time.
