# Tooltips on visual types in Quick
<a name="customizing-visual-tooltips"></a>

When you hover your cursor over any graphical element in an Quick visual, a tooltip appears with information about that specific element. For example, when you hover your cursor over dates in a line chart, a tooltip appears with information about those dates. By default, the fields in the Fields well determine what information displays in tooltips. Tooltips can display up to 10 fields.

You can provide your viewers with additional information about data in your visual, customizing what viewers can see. You can even prevent tooltips from appearing when viewers hover a cursor over an element. To do this, you can customize the tooltips for that visual.

## Using sheet tooltips in Quick
<a name="customizing-visual-tooltips-sheet"></a>

Sheet tooltips transform how viewers explore data by providing rich context without disrupting their analysis flow. Instead of navigating away from a visual or opening separate sheets, viewers get instant access to detailed breakdowns, trends, and supporting information, making dashboards more intuitive and reducing the need for multiple sheets.

Sheet tooltips are available on interactive sheets only. They are not supported on paginated reports. You can duplicate a tooltip sheet to another tooltip sheet, or duplicate a tooltip sheet to a regular interactive sheet. Additionally, you can duplicate a visual to a tooltip sheet.

### How sheet tooltips work
<a name="customizing-visual-tooltips-sheet-how"></a>

When an author creates a sheet tooltip, a tooltip sheet is created and associated with a visual. This tooltip sheet works like a regular sheet. You can add visuals, text boxes, and images to it using a free-form layout. When a viewer hovers over a data point, the tooltip sheet inherits all filters from the source visual and adds an additional filter for the specific data point. For example, if your source visual is filtered to "2025 data" and a viewer hovers over "Electronics," the tooltip shows Electronics data for 2025 only.

Consider a bar chart showing sales by product category. You could create a sheet tooltip that shows a trend line of monthly sales, a KPI of year-over-year growth, and a text box with the category name, all filtered to whichever category the viewer hovers over.

If you would like to apply the same tooltip sheet to another visual, you can do this by assigning one tooltip sheet to multiple visuals in the **Interactions** > **Tooltip** accordion in the **Properties** pane.

### Sheet tooltip considerations
<a name="customizing-visual-tooltips-sheet-considerations"></a>

Keep the following in mind when working with sheet tooltips:
+ Tables and pivot tables support sheet tooltips but not basic or detailed tooltips.
+ Visuals in a tooltip sheet do not support context menus, on-visual menus, or custom actions.
+ [Using custom actions for filtering and navigating](quicksight-actions.md) on visuals in a tooltip sheet are not supported when the sheet is rendered as a tooltip.
+ Sheet tooltips support filters, cross-sheet filtering, and parameters. Filter controls are not supported.
+ Sheet descriptions are not displayed on tooltip sheets.
+ Cross-sheet filters cannot be scoped to tooltip sheets.
+ An analysis must contain at least one regular interactive sheet. An analysis cannot consist of only tooltip sheets.
+ Layer map visuals cannot be placed inside a tooltip sheet.
+ Tooltips on tooltip sheets are not supported.
+ Sheet tooltips are not supported on the following chart types: Sankey, Waterfall, KPI, Radar, Wordcloud, Custom content, and Highcharts.

These limits ensure tooltip sheets load quickly and maintain a focused, scannable experience for viewers. For more complex analysis, consider using drill-down actions or separate detail sheets.
