# Format a currency field

When you format a currency field, you can either choose the currency
symbol from a list of common options, or open the **Format
data** pane and manually format the field. Manually formatting
the field allows you to choose which symbol to use, which separators to use,
the number of decimal places to show, which units to use, and how to display
negative numbers.

Changing a field format changes it for all visuals in the analysis, but
does not change it in the underlying dataset.

If you want to choose the symbol for a currency field from a list of
common options, you can access such a list in several ways. You can access
it from the **Field list** pane, an on-visual editor, or a
visual field well.

###### To select a currency field's symbol by choosing a list option

1. Choose one of the following options:
   - In the **Field list** pane, choose the
     selector icon to the right of the number field that you want
     to format.
   - On any visual that contains an on-visual editor associated
     with the currency field that you want to format, choose that
     on-visual editor. Expand the **Field
     wells** pane, and then choose the field well
     associated with the number field that you want to change.

2. Choose **Format**, and then choose the currency
   field that you want:
   - Display in dollars ($).
   - Display in pounds (£).
   - Display in euros (€).
   - Display in yen or yuan (¥).

###### To manually change a currency field's format

1. Choose one of the following options:
   - In the **Field list** pane, choose the
     selector icon to the right of the number field that you want
     to format.
   - On any visual that contains an on-visual editor associated
     with the number field that you want to format, choose that
     on-visual editor. Expand the **Field
     wells** pane, and then choose the field well
     associated with the number field that you want to
     change.

2. Choose **Format**, and then choose **More
   Formatting Options**.

The **Format data** pane opens. 3. Expand the **Symbol** section and choose from the
following options:

    * Display in dollars ($). This is the default.
    * Display in pounds (£).
    * Display in euros (€).
    * Display in yen or yuan (¥).

4.  Expand the **Separators** section and choose from
    the following options:
    - Under **Decimal**, choose a dot or a
      comma for the decimal separator. A dot is the default. If
      you choose a comma instead, use a dot or a space as the
      thousands separator.
    - Under **Thousands**, select or clear
      **Enabled** to indicate whether you
      want to use a thousands separator.
      **Enabled** is selected by
      default.
    - If you are using a thousands separator, choose whether to
      use a comma, dot, or space for the separator. A comma is the
      default. If you choose a dot instead, use a comma as the
      decimal separator.

5.  Expand the **Decimal Places** section and choose
    the number of decimal places to use. The default is 2. Field values
    are rounded to the decimal places specified. For example, if you
    specify two decimal places, the value 6.728 is rounded to
    6.73.
6.  Expand the **Units** section and choose from the
    following options:
    - Choose the unit to use. Choosing a unit adds the
      appropriate suffix to the number value. For example, if you
      choose **Thousands**, a field value of 1234
      displays as 1.234K.

    The unit options are as follows:

        + No unit suffix. This is the default.
        + Thousands (K)
        + Millions (M)
        + Billions (B)
        + Trillions (T)

    - If you want to use a custom prefix or suffix, specify it
      in the **Prefix** or
      **Suffix** box. Using a custom suffix
      is a good way to specify a currency suffix outside of those
      already offered by Amazon Quick. You can specify both. You
      can also specify a custom prefix in addition to the suffix
      added by selecting a unit.

7.  Expand the **Negatives** section and choose
    whether to display a negative value by using a minus sign or by
    enclosing it in parentheses. Using a minus sign is the
    default.
8.  Expand the **Null values** section and choose
    whether to display null values as `null` or as a custom
    value. Using `null` is the default.

###### Note

When using a table or pivot table, null values only display
for fields that are placed in the **Rows**,
**Columns**, or **Group
by** field wells. Null values for fields in the
**Values** field well appear empty in the
table or pivot table.
