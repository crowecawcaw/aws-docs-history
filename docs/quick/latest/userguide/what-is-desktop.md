# What is Amazon Quick on desktop?

The Amazon Quick desktop application is a native desktop application that extends
Amazon Quick from the browser to your computer. It provides the same AI-powered
capabilities you use in the web experience, plus deep integration with your local files,
system notifications, background processing, and advanced tools like browser automation
and knowledge graph.

The desktop application uses a **local-first architecture**.
The AI backend runs locally on your machine, and your files stay on your computer. The
only network calls are to AI models through API Gateway and to your connected services (such as
Slack, Outlook, or Gmail). This approach keeps your data private while giving you full
access to Amazon Quick capabilities.

###### Note

The Amazon Quick desktop application is currently available as a preview.

###### Note

The Amazon Quick desktop application is available to both Free and Plus accounts
and Professional and Enterprise accounts.

## Benefits of Amazon Quick on desktop

The Amazon Quick desktop application provides the following benefits.

###### Note

The desktop application connects to the same Amazon Quick account you use on
the web. Features available on both platforms work the same way.
The desktop app adds capabilities that require native presence
on your machine.

### Work with your local files directly

The desktop application can read, write, search, and index files in folders you
grant access to. You don't need to upload files — Quick can access
them directly from your file system. You control which folders Quick
can access, and you can revoke access at any time. Per-folder options include
keyword search indexing, semantic search indexing, and knowledge graph
extraction.

### Stay informed with proactive notifications

Background agents run on a schedule to monitor your connected services and
surface what matters. The Activity feed provides a unified, prioritized stream of
items from Slack, email, calendar, and other connected sources. Each feed item
includes an AI-generated summary and suggested actions you can take with one
click.

### Automate recurring tasks with scheduled agents

Create scheduled agents that run on your behalf at set intervals. Agents can
monitor channels, triage emails, summarize meetings, track incidents, and more.
Agents run locally on your machine and deliver results through the Activity feed
or desktop notifications.

### Extend Quick with MCP servers and coding agents

Connect custom MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers to extend what
Quick can do. The desktop application supports local MCP servers (run
a command on your machine), imported configurations (from Kiro, Claude Code, AIM,
or other tools), and remote MCP servers over HTTP. You can also configure coding
agents using the Agent Client Protocol (ACP) to delegate coding tasks to local
agents.

### Browse the web with browser automation

Quick can launch and control Chrome to browse the web, fill forms,
take screenshots, extract data, and interact with web applications on your behalf.
Two modes are available: a default mode that launches a separate Chrome instance
with a copy of your profile, and a "Use my Chrome" mode that connects directly to
your running Chrome with your logins, cookies, and extensions.

### Build a personal knowledge graph

Quick automatically extracts entities and relationships from your
connected sources — Slack messages, emails, calendar events, and local files — and
builds a personal knowledge graph. The graph visualizes people, customers,
projects, events, channels, and other entities relevant to your work, helping
Quick provide more contextual and personalized responses.

### Use voice for hands-free interaction

Speak to Quick using dictation mode (speech-to-text) or talkback
mode (Quick reads responses aloud for a hands-free conversation).
Configure voice settings including voice selection, speed, and a live mode that
keeps the microphone open for continuous conversation.

### Run tasks in the background

Quick can spawn parallel background tasks for complex, multi-step
work. Track progress in the Tasks panel (Mission Control), and continue working in
chat while background tasks complete. This is useful for batch processing,
parallel research, and multi-source analysis.
