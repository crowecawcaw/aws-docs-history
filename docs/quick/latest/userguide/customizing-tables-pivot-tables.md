# Customizing tables and pivot tables in Amazon Quick Sight

Reader customization for tables and pivot tables is enabled by default. You can
change the visual to fit your analysis needs without requesting updates from the
dashboard author. Your customizations are private – other readers of the same
dashboard don't see your changes unless you share them.

###### For dashboard authors

To disable reader customization, choose **Format Visual**,
choose **Interactions**, and then turn off **Reader
Customization**. Republish the dashboard for the change to take
effect.

You can customize tables and pivot tables in the following ways:

- **Sort columns** – Organize data in
  ascending or descending order.
- **Reorder columns** – Rearrange
  columns to reflect the order that matters most to you.
- **Hide and show columns** – Focus on
  relevant data by hiding columns you don't need, and show them again
  when you do.
- **Freeze columns** – Keep important
  columns visible while scrolling horizontally through large
  datasets.
- **Add and remove fields** – Include
  additional fields from the dataset or remove fields you don't
  need.
- **Change aggregations** – Modify how a
  measure is aggregated (for example, change from _Sum_ to
  _Average_).
- **Modify formatting** – Adjust field
  formatting directly in the dashboard view.

###### Note

Reader customization is supported for tables and pivot tables only. Other
visual types don't support reader-level customization at this
time.

## Sorting columns

To sort data in a table or pivot table, choose the column header that you want
to sort by. Choose it again to toggle between ascending and descending
order.

## Reordering columns

To rearrange columns, choose the column header menu and then choose
**Move left** or **Move right**.

## Hiding and showing columns

To hide a column, choose the column header menu and then choose
**Hide**.

To show hidden columns, choose any column header menu and then choose
**Show all hidden fields**.

## Freezing columns

To freeze a column so that it stays in place while you scroll horizontally,
choose the column header menu and then choose **Freeze
column**.

This is useful for keeping key identifiers, such as region names or account
numbers, visible while you review a wide table.

## Adding and removing fields

If the author has made additional fields available for customization, you can
add or remove them from the visual.

###### To add or remove fields

1. On the table or pivot table, choose
   **Customize**.
2. In the field list, select the fields you want to add (for example,
   _City_, _Profit_, or
   _Quantity_).
3. To remove a field, clear its selection in the field list.

The available fields are determined by the author. By default, you can add
back, remove, hide, show, reorder, and change aggregations for the fields that
are already in the visual. Authors can extend this list to include additional
fields from the underlying dataset.

## Changing aggregations

After you add or select a measure field, you can change its aggregation type.
For example, you can change _Order Date_ to aggregate by
**Quarter**, or change
_Quantity_ from **Sum** to
**Average**.

To change an aggregation, choose the field in the customization panel and then
select a different aggregation type.

## Resetting to the default view

To discard all of your customizations and return to the author's original
configuration, choose any column header menu and then choose **Reset
visual**.

## Saving your customizations

Your customizations are saved automatically. When you return to the dashboard,
your personalized view is preserved – you don't need to reapply
settings each time you open the dashboard.

## Sharing customized views

You can share your customized view with other readers in the following
ways:

- **Share this view** – Generate a
  link that preserves your current filters, column selections, and
  ordering. Other users who open the link see the same view. This is
  useful for ad-hoc collaboration.
- **Bookmarks** – Save your
  customizations as a bookmark for recurring use. Bookmarks capture visual
  customizations and applied filters, so you can return to your preferred
  view at any time. Bookmarks can be private or shared across
  teams.

## Exporting customized views

You can schedule and export your customized table or pivot table in the
following formats:

- PDF
- CSV
- Excel

This is useful for sharing data with stakeholders who don't have
Amazon Quick Sight access or for offline analysis.

## Embedding behavior

When tables and pivot tables are embedded in an application, customization
availability and persistence depend on the embedding method.

- **Visual embedding (registered or anonymous
  users)** – You can customize the visual.
  Customizations are not persisted – the original dashboard is
  displayed when the page reloads.
- **Dashboard embedding for registered
  users** – You can customize the visual. If state
  persistence is enabled through embedding options, your customized view is
  preserved on reload. If state persistence is not enabled, the original
  dashboard is displayed.
- **Dashboard embedding for anonymous
  users** – You can customize the visual.
  Customizations are not persisted – the original dashboard is
  displayed when the page reloads.

The `createSharedView` SDK function supports generating a shared
view from a customized embedded dashboard.

## Limitations

- Reader customization is supported for tables and pivot tables only.
  Other visual types, such as bar charts, line charts, and KPIs,
  don't support reader-level customization.
- The fields available for readers to add or remove are controlled by the
  dashboard author. If you need access to a field that isn't
  available, contact the dashboard author.
