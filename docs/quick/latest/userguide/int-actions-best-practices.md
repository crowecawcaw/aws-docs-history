# Best practices

Following best practices for action connectors helps ensure secure, reliable, and efficient operations. These practices help you maintain optimal performance, protect sensitive data, and minimize operational issues.

## Security

### Authentication management

- Regular credential rotation - Update API keys and OAuth tokens on a scheduled basis to maintain security.
- Periodic permission reviews - Audit user and service permissions quarterly to ensure least-privilege access.
- Token lifecycle monitoring - Track token expiration dates and set up alerts before credentials expire.
- Access audit logging - Enable comprehensive logging to track who accessed which services and when.

### Access control

- Implement least-privilege access - Grant only the minimum permissions necessary for each action to function properly.
- Regular permission audits - Review and validate that current permissions align with actual usage patterns and business needs.
- Document access patterns - Maintain clear documentation of who has access to which connectors and why.
- Monitor usage anomalies - Set up alerts for unusual access patterns that might indicate security issues.

## Performance

### Action configuration

- Optimize form defaults - Pre-populate commonly used values to reduce user input time and errors.
- Configure appropriate timeouts - Set realistic timeout values based on typical response times for each service.
- Set up error handling - Implement robust error handling with clear user messages and retry logic where appropriate.
- Document dependencies - Clearly document any prerequisites or dependencies between different actions.

### Resource management

- Monitor API quotas.
- Track usage patterns.
- Optimize refresh schedules.
- Regular cleanup of unused connectors.

## Maintenance

### Regular actions

- Review connector status.
- Update configurations.
- Validate connections.
- Document changes.

### Troubleshooting

- Monitor error patterns.
- Review CloudWatch logs.
- Track resolution times.
- Document solutions.
