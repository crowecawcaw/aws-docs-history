**Note**  
If your Amazon Quick account is integrated with IAM Identity Center (recommended), groups are not managed in the Quick application. Instead, groups are managed in IAM Identity Center or in the third-party identity provider that you configured in IAM Identity Center. Groups are synced automatically between Quick and IAM Identity Center.

Admins with IAM credentials who have access to the Quick console can organize sets of users into groups that make it easier to manage access and security. For example, you can create a group of users that you can share Amazon Quick assets with all at once. You can create and manage groups using the Amazon Quick console or the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI). You can create up to 10,000 groups in a namespace. If you want to create more than 10,000 groups in a namespace, contact [AWS Support](https://aws.amazon.com/contact-us/).

Use the topics below to create, and modify groups with in the Amazon Quick console or with the Amazon Quick APIs.

After you create a group, you can add and remove users from the **Manage groups** page. You can't add a user to a group if you haven't added the user to your account. For more information on adding users to your Amazon Quick account, see [Managing user access inside Amazon Quick](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/quicksight/latest/user/managing-users.html).

**To add a user to a group**

1. Choose the group that you want to add a user to, and choose **ADD USER** at the page's upper right.

1. Enter the user name or email of the user that you want to add, and choose the correct user for **Search users**.

**To remove a user from a group:**

1. On the Amazon Quick start page, choose **Manage Quick**, and then choose **Manage groups**.

1. Choose the group that you want to remove a user from.

1. Find the user that you want to remove and choose **Remove**.

Choosing **remove** automatically removes the selected user from the group.

You can also search for a group member by entering the user's full user name into the search bar on the right-hand side of the group's page.

## Create and manage groups with the AWS CLI
<a name="creating-groups-cli"></a>

Before you begin, make sure that you have the AWS CLI installed. For more information, see [Installing the AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-install.html) in the *AWS CLI User Guide. *

Use the following procedure to create an Quick user group.

1. Open a terminal window. If you are using Microsoft Windows, open a command prompt.

1. Enter the following command at the prompt to create a group. Substitute the correct values for your parameters.

   ```
   aws quicksight create-group --aws-account-id={{111122223333}} --namespace={{default}} --group-name="{{Sales-Management}}" --description="{{Sales Management - Forecasting}}" 
   ```

   You might find it easier to create the command in a text editor before entering it at the prompt. For more information on `create-group` and other available commands, see the [Amazon Quick API reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/quicksight/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html). 

1. Verify that the group exists by using a command similar to one of the following. The following command lists all groups.

   ```
   aws quicksight list-groups --aws-account-id {{111122223333}} --namespace {{default}} 
   ```

   The following command describes a specific group.

   ```
   aws quicksight describe-group --aws-account-id {{11112222333}} --namespace {{default}} --group-name {{Sales}}
   ```

   The following command searches for groups in a specified Amazon Quick namespace.

   ```
   aws quicksight search-groups --region {{us-west-2}} --aws-account-id {{11112222333}} --namespace {{default}} --filters "[{\"Operator\": \"StartsWith\", \"Name\": \"GROUP_NAME\", \"Value\": \"Mar\"}]"
   ```

1. Add a member to the new group by using a command similar to the following.

   ```
    aws quicksight create-group-membership --aws-account-id {{111122223333}} --namespace {{default}} --group-name {{Sales}} --member-name {{Pat}}
   ```

   The following command determines if a user is a member of a specified group.

   ```
   aws quicksight describe-group-membership --region {{us-west-2}} --aws-account-id {{11112222333}} --namespace {{default}} --group-name {{Marketing-East}} --member-name {{user}}
   ```

Enter the following command at the prompt to delete a group. Substitute the correct values for your parameters.

```
aws quicksight delete-group --aws-account-id {{111122223333}} --namespace {{default}} --group-name {{Marketing-East}}
```

You might find it easier to create the command in a text editor before entering it at the prompt. For more information on `delete-group` and other available commands, see the [Amazon Quick API reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/quicksight/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html).
