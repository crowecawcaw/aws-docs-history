# Configuring the VPC

connection in the Amazon Quick console

To create a secure private connection to the Amazon VPC service from the Amazon Quick
console, use the following procedure.

###### Prerequisites

- Sign in to Amazon Quick as a Amazon Quick admin to set up a VPC connection in
  Amazon Quick. To verify that you're a Amazon Quick administrator, choose your
  profile icon in the upper-right. If your profile menu contains the option
  **Manage Amazon Quick**, then you're a Amazon Quick
  administrator. Make sure your admin role in IAM includes the following
  permissions. The `"iam:PassRole"` permission needs to be applied only
  to the execution role that is created in the procedures below.
  - `"quicksight:ListVPCConnections"`
  - `"quicksight:CreateVPCConnection"`
  - `"quicksight:DescribeVPCConnection"`
  - `"quicksight:DeleteVPCConnection"`
  - `"quicksight:UpdateVPCConnection"`
  - `"ec2:describeSubnets"`
  - `"ec2:describeVpcs"`
  - `"ec2:describeSecurityGroups"`
  - `"iam:ListRoles"`
  - `"iam:PassRole"`

  The following example shows an IAM policy that applies
  `"iam:PassRole"` only to the execution role.

  JSON

  ```
  `{
   "Version":"2012-10-17",
   "Statement": [
   {
   "Effect": "Allow",
   "Action": [
   "iam:PassRole"
   ],
   "Resource": "arn:aws:iam::`111122223333`:role/vpc-role-for-qs"
   }
   ]
  }`

  ```

- Before you begin, make sure that you have the following information available
  to copy and paste into the **VPC Connection** screen. For more
  information, see [Finding information to connect to a VPC](../../../quicksight/latest/user/vpc-finding-setup-information.md "../../../quicksight/latest/user/vpc-finding-setup-information.md").
  - AWS Region – The AWS Region where you plan
    to create a connection to your data source.
  - VPC ID – The ID of the VPC that contains the
    data, the subnets, and the security groups that you plan to use.
  - Execution role– An IAM role that contains a
    trust policy that allows Amazon Quick to create, update, and delete
    network infrastructure in your account. This policy is required for all
    VPC connections. At minimum, the IAM policy needs the following Amazon EC2
    permissions:

        - `DescribeSecurityGroups`
        - `DescribeSubnets`
        - `CreateNetworkInterface`
        - `DeleteNetworkInterface`
        - `ModifyNetworkInterfaceAttribute`

    The following example shows an IAM policy that you can add to an
    existing IAM role to create, delete, or modify a VPC
    connection:

  JSON

  ```
  `{
   "Version":"2012-10-17",
   "Statement": [
   {
   "Effect": "Allow",
   "Action": [
   "ec2:CreateNetworkInterface",
   "ec2:ModifyNetworkInterfaceAttribute",
   "ec2:DeleteNetworkInterface",
   "ec2:DescribeSubnets",
   "ec2:DescribeSecurityGroups"
   ],
   "Resource": "*"
   }
   ]
  }`

  ```

  After you add the necessary permissions to an IAM role, attach a
  trust policy to allow Amazon Quick to configure the VPC connection to
  your account. The following example shows a trust policy that you can
  add to an existing IAM role to allow Amazon Quick access to the
  role:

  JSON

  ```
  `{
   "Version":"2012-10-17",
   "Statement": [
   {
   "Effect": "Allow",
   "Principal": {
   "Service": "quicksight.amazonaws.com"
   },
   "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
   }
   ]
  }`

  ```

  - Subnet IDs – The IDs of the subnets that the
    Amazon Quick network interface is using. Each VPC connection needs at
    least two subnets.
  - Security group IDs – The IDs of the security
    groups. Each VPC connection needs at least one security group.

###### To create a secure private connection to the Amazon VPC service from Quick

Enterprise edition

1. In Amazon Quick, choose your profile icon in the upper-right, then choose
   **Manage Amazon Quick**.

Only Amazon Quick administrators can view the **Manage
Amazon Quick** option. If you don't see this option on your profile
menu, you're not an administrator. In this case, contact your Amazon Quick
account administrators for assistance. 2. In the left navigation pane, choose **Manage VPC
connections**. 3. On the **Manage VPC connections** page that opens, choose
**Add VPC connection**. 4. For **VPC connection name**, enter a unique descriptive name
of your choice. This name doesn't need to be an actual VPC ID or name. 5. In the **VPC ID** dropdown menu, choose the ID of the VPC in
Amazon EC2 that you want to connect to your Amazon Quick account. This field
can't be changed later. 6. In the **Execution role** dropdown menu, choose the
appropriate IAM role to use for the VPC connection. The **Execution
role** dropdown only shows IAM policies that contain a trust
policy that allows Amazon Quick to configure the VPC connection to your
account. 7. In the **Subnets** table, choose a subnet ID from the
**Subnet ID** dropdown menu of at least two of the listed
**Availability zones**. The Availability Zones listed in
the **Subnets** table are determined based on how you
configured the VPC connection in the Amazon EC2 console. 8. (Optional) If you aren't using DNS resolver endpoints, skip to the next step.

If your database host IP address must be resolved through private DNS servers
in your AWS account, enter IP addresses for Route 53 Resolver inbound endpoints
(one per line).

Make sure that you are entering an endpoint, rather than a database address
like the one you plan to use in Amazon Quick. Most databases that are hosted by
AWS don't need to resolve DNS queries between VPCs and a customer's network.
For more information, see [Resolving
DNS queries between VPCs and your network](../../../Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/resolver.md "../../../Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/resolver.md") in the
_Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide._ You only need this endpoint if you
can't resolve the IP address that connects to your database by using the public
DNS server system. 9. Review your choices, then choose **ADD**.
When you finish creating a VPC connection, the new connection appears in the
**Manage VPC connections** table. In some cases, the status of the
new VPC might be **UNAVAILABLE** until the connection is configured on
the backend. After Amazon Quick is finished configuring the new connection, the status
of the connection switches to **AVAILABLE**, which indicates that the
connection has been established. The following table describes the different
**Status** values for a VPC connection.

| Status                  | Description                                                                                                                        |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **AVAILABLE**           | The VPC connection is established and can be used.                                                                                 |
| **PARTIALLY AVAILABLE** | One of the network interfaces that is configured to the VPC<br>connection is unavailable. The VPC connection can still be<br>used. |
| **UNAVAILABLE**         | The VPC connection is not established and can't be<br>used.                                                                        |

To see a summary of a VPC connection, choose a VPC connection from the **VPC
connection name** row of the **Manage VPC connections**
table. The pop-up box that appears shows information about the network interfaces
associated with the VPC connection.

The following table describes the different **Status** values for a
network interface.

| Status                                | Description                                                                                                                                            |

| **AVAILABLE**                         | The network interface is available for use.                                                                                                            |
| **CREATION_FAILURE**                  | The network interface couldn't be created.                                                                                                             |
| **UPDATING**                          | The security group associated with the network inferface is<br>updating.                                                                               |
| **UPDATE_FAILED**                     | The security group associated with the network interface did not<br>update successfully.                                                               |
| **DELETING**                          | The network interface is in the process of being deleted.                                                                                              |
| **DELETED**                           | The network interface is deleted and can no longer be used.                                                                                            |
| **DELETION_FAILED**                   | The network interface deletion failed and can still be<br>used.                                                                                        |
| **DELETION_SCHEDULED**                | This network interface is scheduled for deletion.                                                                                                      |
| **ATTACHMENT_FAILED_ROLLBACK_FAILED** | The elastic interface failed to attach and Amazon Quick was unable<br>to delete the elastic network interface that was created within your<br>account. |

When you delete a network interface from a VPC connection, the status of the
connection changes to **PARTIALLY AVAILABLE** to indicate the loss of a
network interface.

To make changes to an existing VPC connection, choose the more actions (three-dots)
button to the right of the connection that you want to modify, and choose
**Edit**. In the **Edit VPC connection** window
that appears, make your changes, and then choose **SAVE**.

To delete a VPC connection, choose the more actions (three-dots) button to the right
of the connection that you want to delete and choose **Delete**. In the
**Delete Amazon Quick VPC Connection** pop-up that appears, confirm
that you want to delete the connection, and then choose
**Delete**.
