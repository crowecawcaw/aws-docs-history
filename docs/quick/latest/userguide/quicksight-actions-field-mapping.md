# Understanding field mapping for

custom actions in Amazon Quick Sight

Automated field mapping is based on identical fields. Fields with the same name
and data type map automatically across datasets. Their field names and data types
must be an exact match. This works similar to a join, except that it is
automatically generated based on names and data types for every matching field. If
you are missing fields, you can create them by using calculated fields in the
dataset that's missing a field. If you don't want to have some of the
fields mapped to each other, you can rename or remove them from the dataset.

It's important to make sure that all target fields are mapped if they are
enabled for use with a filter action (in the **Filter scope**).
Doing this allows filtering to apply automatically. If some target fields
aren't mapped, the automatic filtering doesn't work.

Mapping is generated only when you create or save a custom action. So after every
change that affects the mapping, make sure to return to it and save it again. When
you create an action, mapping is based on the fields as they exist at that point.
When you save an action, any mapped fields that you renamed since you created the
custom action stay mapped. However, if you alter the data type of a mapped field,
the mapping is removed.

If your mapping is missing some fields, you can do one of the following to fix
it:

- Only target the mapped fields, by removing the unmapped fields from the
  **Filter scope.**
- Remove the visual in question from the target visuals.
- Create calculated fields to supply the missing fields for the mapping, and
  then save your custom action.
- Edit the dataset and rename the fields or change their data types, and
  then save your custom action.
- Edit the dataset and rename the fields or change their data types, and
  then resave your custom action.

###### Note

The information that displays on the mapping screen shows the configuration
from the most recent time you saved it. To refresh or update the view, save the
action again.

If you add or edit datasets, they aren't automatically mapped or remapped.
This causes the filtering to work incorrectly. For example, suppose that you add a
new dataset, then create visuals for it. The new visuals won't respond to
filter actions, because there is no field mapping to connect them. When you make
changes, remember to save your custom actions again to redo the field
mappings.

If you remove a parameterized field or any other targeted field from the source
visual, the action that uses it breaks. The action for the missing field either
doesn't work when you select a data point, or it's hidden from the context
menu.
