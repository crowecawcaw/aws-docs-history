# Adding a unique key to an Amazon Quick Sight dataset

Quick authors can configure a unique key column to a Quick Sight dataset
during data preparation. This unique key acts as a global sorting key for the dataset
and optimizes query generation for table visuals. When a user creates a table visual in
Quick Sight and adds the unique key column to the value field well,data is sorted from
left to right up to the unique key column. All columns to the right of the unique key
column are ignored in the sort order. Tables that don't contain a unique key are
sorted based on the order that the columns appear in the dataset.

The following limitations apply to unique keys:

- Unique keys are only supported for unaggregated tables.
- If a dataset column is used for column level security (CLS), the column
  can't also be used as the unique key.
  Use the following procedure to designate a unique key for a dataset in Amazon Quick Sight.

###### To set up a unique key

1. Open the [Quick console](https://quicksight.aws.amazon.com/ "https://quicksight.aws.amazon.com/").
2. Choose **Data**.
3. Perform one of the following actions:
   1. Navigate to the dataset that you want to add a unique key to, choose
      the ellpisis (three dots) next to the dataset, and then choose
      **Edit**.
   2. Choose **New** then **Dataset**.
      Choose the dataset that you want to add and then choose **Edit
      data source**. For more information about creating new
      datasets in Amazon Quick Sight, see [Creating datasets](creating-data-sets.md "creating-data-sets.md").

4. The data preparation page for the dataset opens. Navigate to the
   **Fields** pane and locate the field that you want to set
   as the unique key.
5. Choose the ellipsis (three dots) next to the field name, and then choose
   **Set as unique key**.
   After you create a unique key, a key icon appears next to the field to show that the
   field is now the unique key for the dataset. When you save and publish the dataset, the
   unique key configuration is applied to the dataset and to all dashboards and analyses
   that are created with that dataset. To remove a unique key from a dataset, navigate to
   the data preparation page for the dataset, choose the ellipsis next to the unique key
   field, and then choose **Remove as unique key**. After you remove a
   unique key from a dataset, you can designate a different field as the unique key.
