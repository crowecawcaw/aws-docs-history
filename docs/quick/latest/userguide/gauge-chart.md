# Using gauge charts

Use gauge charts to compare values for items in a measure. You can compare them to
another measure or to a custom amount.

A gauge chart is similar to a nondigital gauge, for example a gas gauge in an
automobile. It displays how much there is of the thing you are measuring. In a gauge
chart, this measurement can exist alone or in relation to another measurement. Each
color section in a gauge chart represents one value. In the following example, we are
comparing actual sales to the sales goal, and the gauge shows that we must sell an
additional 33.27% to meet the goal.

To create a gauge chart, you need to use at least one measure. Put the measure in the
**Value** field well. If you want to compare two measures, put the
additional measure in the **Target value** field well. If you want to
compare a single measure to a target value that isn't in your dataset, you can use
a calculated field that contains a fixed value.

You can choose a variety of formatting options for the gauge chart, including the
following settings in **Format visual**.

- **Value displayed** –
  Hide value, display actual value, or display a comparison of two values
- **Comparison method** –
  Compare values as a percent, the actual difference between values, or difference
  as a percent
- **Axis style** –
  - **Show axis label** – Show or
    hide the axis label
  - **Range** – The numeric
    minimum and maximum range to display in the gauge chart
  - **Reserve padding (%)** –
    Added to the top of the range (target, actual value, or max)

- **Arc style** – Degrees
  the arc displays (180° to 360°)
- **Thickness** –
  Thickness of the arc (small, medial, or large)

## Creating a gauge chart

Use the following procedure to create a gauge chart.

###### To create a gauge chart

1. On the analysis page, choose **Visualize** on the tool
   bar.
2. Choose **Add** on the application bar, and then choose
   **Add visual**.
3. On the **Visual types** pane, choose the gauge chart
   icon.
4. From the **Fields list** pane, drag the fields that you
   want to use to the appropriate field wells. To create a gauge chart, drag a
   measure to the **Value** field well. To add a comparison
   value, drag a different measure to the **Target value**
   field well.
