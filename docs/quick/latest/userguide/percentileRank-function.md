# percentileRank
<a name="percentileRank-function"></a>

The `percentileRank` function calculates the percentile rank of a measure or a dimension in comparison to the specified partitions. The percentile rank value({{x}}) indicates that the current item is above {{x}}% of values in the specified partition. The percentile rank value ranges from 0 (inclusive) to 100 (exclusive). 

## Syntax
<a name="percentileRank-function-syntax"></a>

The brackets are required. To see which arguments are optional, see the following descriptions.

```
percentileRank
(
      {{[ sort_order_field ASC_or_DESC, ... ]}} 
     {{,[ {partition_field}, ... ]}}
)
```

## Arguments
<a name="percentileRank-function-arguments"></a>

 *sort order field*   
One or more aggregated measures and dimensions that you want to sort the data by, separated by commas. You can specify either ascending (**ASC**) or descending (**DESC**) sort order.   
Each field in the list is enclosed in {} (curly braces), if it is more than one word. The entire list is enclosed in [ ] (square brackets).

 *partition field*   
(Optional) One or more dimensions that you want to partition by, separated by commas.   
Each field in the list is enclosed in {} (curly braces), if it is more than one word. The entire list is enclosed in [ ] (square brackets).

 *calculation level*  
(Optional) Specifies the calculation level to use:  
+ **`PRE_FILTER`** – Prefilter calculations are computed before the dataset filters.
+ **`PRE_AGG`** – Preaggregate calculations are computed before applying aggregations and top and bottom *N* filters to the visuals.
+ **`POST_AGG_FILTER`** – (Default) Table calculations are computed when the visuals display. 
This value defaults to `POST_AGG_FILTER` when blank. For more information, see [Using level-aware calculations in Quick](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/quicksight/latest/user/level-aware-calculations.html).

## Example
<a name="percentileRank-function-example"></a>

The following example does a percentile ranking of `max(Sales)` in descending order, by `State`. 

```
percentileRank
(
     [max(Sales) DESC], 
     [State]
)
```

The following example does a percentile ranking of `Customer Region` by total `Billed Amount`. The fields in the table calculation are in the field wells of the visual.

```
percentileRank(
     [sum({Billed Amount}) DESC],
     [{Customer Region}]
)
```

The following screenshot shows the results of the example, along with the total `Billed Amount` so you can see how each region compares.
