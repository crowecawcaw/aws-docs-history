# Browser extension

The Amazon Quick browser extension is available within Amazon Quick to all eligible
users by default and requires no administrative setup for user access. Users can find
the browser extension installation link under **Connections** >
**Extensions**. The following procedures are for IT administrators
who want to automatically deploy or disable the Amazon Quick browser extension across
all browsers in their organization using managed device policies.

## Deploy the browser extension

fleet with managed browsers.

To deploy the browser extension to all users in your organization, you can define
an **ExtensionSettings** policy and distribute this policy to your
managed devices.

### Install using ExtensionSettings policy

The **ExtensionSettings** policy is an administrative setting
for Chrome, Edge, and Firefox that
allows you to manage the installation, permissions, and runtime behavior of
specific extensions on managed devices. This policy provides granular control by
letting administrators specify custom configurations, such as setting
installation modes like force install and restricting or allowing specific site
access and permissions for individual extensions or all extensions.

The format of the **ExtensionSettings** policy depends on the
operating system where you want to distribute this policy.
Windows, Mac, and Linux are
supported.

To set the install mode in the **ExtensionSettings** policy,
you need the extension identifier and the store URL:

- **Chrome/Edge**
  - ID: `innkphffipcmiflfibbeghfnkifiokgo`
  - URL:
    `https://clients2.google.com/service/update2/crx`

- **Firefox**
  - ID: `quick-browser-extension@amazon.com`
  - URL:
    `https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/latest/amazon-quick/latest.xpi`

### Distribute ExtensionSettings policy

Distributing the **ExtensionSettings** policy depends on the
device and browser management solution used by your organization. You can use
managed solutions like **Chrome Enterprise Core** or
**Microsoft Edge** management service, or distribute the
**ExtensionSettings** policy using **Group
Policy**, which differs per operating system.

## Disable the browser extension

###### Note

The following deployment guide applies only when you have a managed device
fleet with managed browsers.

To disable the browser extension for all users in your organization, you can
define an **ExtensionSettings** policy and distribute this policy
to your managed devices.
