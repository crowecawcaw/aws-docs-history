# Adding numeric filters

Fields with decimal or int data types are considered numeric fields. You create
filters on numeric fields by specifying a comparison type, for example **Greater
than** or **Between**, and a comparison value or values as
appropriate to the comparison type. Comparison values must be positive integers and
can't contain commas.

You can use the following comparison types in numeric filters:

- Equals
- Does not equal
- Greater than
- Greater than or equal to
- Less than
- Less than or equal to
- Between

###### Note

To use a top and bottom filter for numeric data (analyses only), first change the
field from a measure to a dimension. Doing this converts the data to text. Then you
can use a text filter. For more information, see [Adding text filters](add-a-text-filter-data-prep.md "add-a-text-filter-data-prep.md").

In analyses, for datasets based on database queries, you can also optionally apply an
aggregate function to the comparison value or values, for example
**Sum** or **Average**.

You can use the following aggregate functions in numeric filters:

- Average
- Count
- Count distinct
- Max
- Median
- Min
- Percentile
- Standard deviation
- Standard deviation - population
- Sum
- Variance
- Variance - population

## Creating numeric filters

Use the following procedure to create a numeric field filter.

###### To create a numeric field filter

1. Create a new filter using a text field. For more information about
   creating filters, see [Adding filters](add-a-filter-data-prep.md "add-a-filter-data-prep.md").
2. In the **Filters** pane, choose the new filter to expand
   it.
3. (Optional) For **Aggregation**, choose an aggregation. No
   aggregation is applied by default. This option is available only when
   creating numeric filters in an analysis.
4. For **Filter condition**, choose a comparison
   type.
5. Do one of the following:
   - If you chose a comparison type other than
     **Between**, enter a comparison value.

   If you chose a comparison type of **Between**,
   enter the beginning of the value range in **Minimum
   value** and the end of the value range in
   **Maximum value**.
   - (Analyses only) To use an existing parameter, enable **Use
     parameters**, then choose your parameter from the
     list.

   For parameters to appear in this list, create your parameters
   first. Usually, you create a parameter, add a control for it, and
   then add a filter for it. For more information, see [Parameters in Amazon Quick](parameters-in-quicksight.md "parameters-in-quicksight.md"). The values display
   alphabetically in the control, unless there are more than 1,000
   distinct values. Then the control displays a search box instead.
   Each time you search for the value that you want to use, it
   initiates a new query. If the results contain more than 1,000
   values, you can scroll through the values with pagination.

6. (Analyses only) For **Null options** choose
   **Exclude nulls**, **Include nulls**,
   or **Nulls only**.
7. When finished, choose **Apply**.
