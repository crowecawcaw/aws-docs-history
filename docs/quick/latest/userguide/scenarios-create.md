# Creating an Amazon Quick Sight scenario

Amazon Quick Pro users can create scenarios from Quick Sight dashboards, or from the
**Scenarios** section on the Quick Sight home page. Users can
create as many scenarios as they need. Each user can have up to 3 active scenarios at a
time. Each Quick Sight account supports up to 10 active scenarios at a time. Use the
following procedure to create a scenario in Amazon Quick Sight.

###### Create a new scenario

1. Open the [Quick console](https://quicksight.aws.amazon.com/ "https://quicksight.aws.amazon.com/").
2. Perform one of the following actions:
   1. Open any dashboard, and look for one of the following:
      - Choose **Analyze this dashboard in a
        Scenario**, if available, at the top of the
        dashboard.
      - From a visual on the dashboard, open the drop-down menu and
        choose **Explore scenario**.
      - Choose **Build**, and then choose
        **Scenario**.

   2. On the Quick home page, choose
      **Scenarios**. On the
      **Scenarios**, choose **New
      Scenario**.

3. The new scenario appears. In the text box, describe the problem that you want
   to solve. This input is the starting point for all of the data pivots and
   manipulations that will occur in the scenario. The description that you provide
   can be as broad or as specific as you want, for example "analyze usage trends"
   or “compute month-over-month and year-over-year changes in usage based on last
   month's data."
4. Add the data that you want to use in the scenario. You can choose data from
   Quick Sight dashboards, or you can upload files from your computer. When you
   choose data from a dashboard, a preview of the selected data is generated for
   you to review. For more information about previewing and editing data in
   Quick Sight scenarios, see [Working with data in an Amazon Quick Sight scenario](scenarios-data.md "scenarios-data.md").

The following limits apply to the data that is used in a scenario:

    * You can add up to 10 data sources to a scenario.
    * Up to 20 visuals can be selected from a dashboard at a time.
    * Uploaded files must be in `.xlsx` or `.csv`
     format and can't exceed 1 GB.
    * Data sources can have up to 200 columns.

If you don't add data to the scenario, Amazon Q automatically searches your
Quick Sight dashboards to find data related to your problem statement from the
previous step. 5. Choose **Start analysis**.
When you start an analysis in a Quick Sight scenario, Quick Sight prepares your data
for analysis and returns a new _thread_. The thread contains
generated prompts that can be used to solve the problem that you described in the
scenario. A thread is a turn based contextual conversation that consists of user prompts
and Amazon Q responses that you can use to drill down on a specific scenario. You can use
threads to write prompts that assume that Amazon Q remembers what was previously discussed in
the thread. You can choose a prompt to continue the thread, or you can choose the plus
sign (+) above the thread to start a new thread. The new thread uses a different
prompt than the first thread that you created. For more information about working with
threads, see [Working with threads in an Amazon Quick Sight scenario](scenarios-threads.md "scenarios-threads.md").
