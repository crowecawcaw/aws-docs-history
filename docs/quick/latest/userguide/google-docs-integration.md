<a name="google-docs-integration"></a>

With the Google Docs connector, you can access Google Docs directly in Amazon Quick through natural language. You can create and edit documents, read content, insert text and images, and manage document structure without leaving Amazon Quick.

Amazon Quick supports multiple authentication methods for Google Docs. Choose the method that best fits your organization's security requirements.
+ **Default OAuth app** – Uses an AWS-managed OAuth application. No additional credentials are needed. You authenticate directly with your Google account.
+ **Custom OAuth app** – Uses a customer-managed OAuth client created in the Google Cloud Console. This option gives your organization full control over the OAuth configuration.

For more information about the authentication methods that Amazon Quick supports, see [Authentication methods](quick-action-auth.md).

## Before you begin
<a name="google-docs-integration-prerequisites"></a>

Make sure that you have the following before you set up the integration.
+ A Google account with access to Google Docs.
+ For **Custom OAuth app**: Access to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) on the Google website with permissions to create OAuth clients.
+ For Amazon Quick subscription requirements, see [Set up integrations in the console](integration-console-setup-process.md).

## Configuring Google Cloud
<a name="google-docs-source-setup"></a>

If you use **Default OAuth app** authentication, skip this section and see [Setting up the connector in Amazon Quick](#google-docs-quicksuite-setup).

For Custom OAuth app authentication, complete the following steps in the Google Cloud Console before you configure Amazon Quick. When you enable the API in step 3, search for and enable the **Google Docs API**.

### Create an OAuth client in Google Cloud Console
<a name="w2aac46c28d105c13b7"></a>

Create an OAuth client in the Google Cloud Console to get the client credentials that you need for Amazon Quick. For more information, see [Using OAuth 2.0 to Access Google APIs](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2) on the Google website.

1. Sign in to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) on the Google website.

1. Create a new project or select an existing project.

1. In the left navigation pane, choose **APIs & Services**, then choose **Library**. Search for the API that your integration requires and choose **Enable**.

1. Choose **OAuth consent screen** and choose **Get Started**.

1. Configure the consent screen:
   + Enter an **App Name** and select a **User support email**.
   + For **Audience**, choose **Internal** (your organization only) or **External** (any Google user).
   + Add developer contact details and choose **Create**.

1. Choose **Create OAuth client**.

## Managing and troubleshooting
<a name="google-docs-integration-troubleshooting"></a>

To edit, share, or delete your connector, see [Managing existing integrations](integration-workflows.md#managing-existing-integrations).

### Common Google authentication issues
<a name="w2aac46c28d105c19b5"></a>
+ **Sign-in fails (Default OAuth app or Custom OAuth app)** – Verify that your Google account is active and that you can sign in to [the Google website](https://accounts.google.com) directly. For Custom OAuth app, confirm that the redirect URI in your Google Cloud OAuth client matches the Amazon Quick callback URL.
+ **App blocked by administrator** – If your Google Workspace administrator restricts third-party app access, you might see an error when you attempt to sign in. Contact your Google Workspace administrator to allow the Amazon Quick app.
+ **Invalid client credentials (Custom OAuth app)** – Verify that the Client ID and Client secret match the values in your Google Cloud OAuth client.
+ **Authentication popup fails** – Verify that your browser allows popups from the Amazon Quick console domain. Try using a different browser or clearing your browser cache.
+ **Permissions revoked** – If you previously revoked Amazon Quick access from your Google Account permissions settings, you need to re-authenticate by editing the connector and signing in again.
+ **Google API rate limiting** – Google might limit requests during high usage periods. If actions fail, retry after a few minutes.

### Google Docs-specific issues
<a name="google-docs-troubleshooting-service"></a>
+ **Google Docs API not enabled** – Verify that the Google Docs API is enabled in your Google Cloud project under **APIs & Services**, **Library**.
