<a name="excel-extension-guide"></a>

The Amazon Quick extension for Excel helps you work with data faster by automating data cleaning, analysis, and visualization tasks while integrating with your enterprise data sources.

You can search for Amazon Quick in the Microsoft Excel app store or visit the [Quick for Excel Microsoft store page](https://marketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/product/WA200010611) to add the extension.

Key capabilities include:
+ **Data import and preparation:** Pull data from Quick dashboards, structured datasets, spaces, and uploaded files directly into your spreadsheet. Identify inconsistencies and clean data automatically, and apply formatting and templates based on your data and objectives.
+ **Spreadsheet debugging:** Ask Quick to explain calculations behind cells or tables, debug and fix formula errors, and highlight anomalies and inconsistencies in your data.
+ **Data analysis and insights:** Automatically analyze patterns and trends, create pivot tables and charts with natural language prompts, and perform sensitivity analysis and scenario planning.
+ **Spreadsheet automation:** Apply filters, transformations, and conditional formatting using prompts, and generate appropriate templates based on your content and objectives.
+ **Enterprise knowledge integration:** Choose an agent or a space to respond from and incorporate relevant information from your organization's knowledge into your spreadsheets. Integrate data from Quick dashboards, spaces, and knowledge bases.
+ **External actions:** Perform actions in third-party applications using your configured [connectors](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/quicksuite/latest/userguide/action-connectors.html) or apps directly from Excel.

**Important**  
The Amazon Quick Excel extension uses generative AI to create and execute code within your Excel application sandbox. AI can make mistakes and perform inaccurate actions within your Excel workbook. No spreadsheet data is read when the side panel is closed, and no data is sent to Amazon Quick unless you explicitly send a prompt.
Amazon Quick does not use your user data for service improvement or for training its underlying large language models (LLMs).

To protect your organization's data, carefully evaluate usage and plan deployment with data privacy in mind. Amazon Quick maintains strict data privacy by not using customer data for service improvements, not using customer data to enhance language models, and not indexing Microsoft Excel conversations into your company's Amazon Quick instance.
