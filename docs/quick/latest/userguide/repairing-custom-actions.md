# Repairing custom actions

For a custom action to work, every field and parameter it references must be
active in the parent widget. If a field is missing from the source widget, or if a
parameter is missing from the analysis, the action for that field or parameter
becomes unavailable. Menu actions are no longer included in the context menu. Select
actions no longer respond to attempts to interact. However, in all other ways, the
widget continues to function. No error displays to your users. You can fix broken
filter actions and URL actions by adding the missing fields back to the broken
visual or insight.

The following procedure explains how to fix an action that broke because someone
removed a field or parameter without updating the action. These steps provide basic
guidance how to fix this issue. However, use your own judgment on how or if you
should make changes to the analysis. If you're not sure, it's better to ask a
Amazon Quick administrator for assistance before you change anything. For example,
there might be a way to restore a previous version of the analysis, which might be
safer if you aren't sure what happened to it.

###### To remove a field from a broken action

1. From the start page, choose **Analyses**. Then choose the
   analysis to fix.
2. Choose the visual or insight where the action no longer works. Make sure
   that it's highlighted on the sheet.
3. Choose **Actions** from the Menu options dropdown in the
   upper right corner.
4. Locate the action you want to fix and choose
   **Edit**.
5. If the action type is **Filter action**, and you see an
   error that says _the field used by this action was
   removed_, check the settings for **Filter
   scope**. **Selected fields** can only display
   fields that are in the visual. To disable selected fields that are removed,
   choose one of the following:
   - Change the **Filter scope** setting to
     **All fields**. Doing this enables the widget
     to filter on every field.
   - If you want to use a list of **Selected fields**,
     verify the list of fields. If you need to include another field, you
     need to add it to the visual first.

6. If the action type is **Navigation action**, follow the
   guidance on the error message, which reflects the type of change that caused
   the error.
7. If the action type is **URL action**, check the
   **URL** setting for variables marked with double angle
   brackets (`<<FIELD-OR-$PARAMETER>`). Open the list of
   available variables by choosing the plus icon. Remove any fields or
   parameters that aren't in the list. Be sure you also remove the matching
   _URL parameter_ and it's separator
   (`?` for the first URL parameter, or `&` for
   subsequent parameters). The following examples show (in **bold**) which part is removed if you were removing
   the field named `Product` from the visual.

```
https://www.example.com/examplefunction**?q=<<Product>**
```

```
https://www.example.com/examplefunction?**q=<<Product>&**uact=<<$CSN>
```

```
https://www.example.com/examplefunction?pass=yes&q=**<<Product>+**<<City>&oq=**<<Product>+**<<City>&uact=<<$CSN>
```

Make sure to test the new URL. 8. (Optional) To delete the action, scroll to the end and choose
**Delete**. 9. When you are finished, confirm your changes to the action. Scroll to the
bottom of the **Action** pane and choose
**Save**.

If the error also exists in an associated dashboard, share and publish the
dashboard again to propagate the fix.
