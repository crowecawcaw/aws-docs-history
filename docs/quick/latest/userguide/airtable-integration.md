# Airtable integration
<a name="airtable-integration"></a>

With the Airtable connector, you can access the Airtable platform directly in Amazon Quick through natural language. You can create and update records, manage bases and tables, filter views, and perform relational data operations without leaving Amazon Quick.

Amazon Quick supports multiple authentication methods for Airtable. Choose the method that best fits your organization's security requirements.
+ **Default OAuth app** – Uses an AWS-managed OAuth application. No additional credentials are needed. Users authenticate directly with their Airtable account.
+ **Custom OAuth app** – Uses a customer-managed OAuth application registered in Airtable. This option gives your organization full control over the OAuth configuration.
+ **API Key** – Uses an Airtable personal access token for authentication. Suitable for individual use or testing.

For more information about the authentication methods that Amazon Quick supports, see [Authentication methods](quick-action-auth.md).

## Before you begin
<a name="airtable-integration-prerequisites"></a>

Make sure that you have the following before you set up the integration.
+ An active Airtable account with access to the bases and data that you want to use.
+ For **Custom OAuth app**: Access to the [Airtable Builder Hub](https://airtable.com/create/oauth) on the Airtable website to register an OAuth integration.
+ For **API Key**: A personal access token from the [Airtable Builder Hub](https://airtable.com/create/tokens) on the Airtable website.
+ For Amazon Quick subscription requirements, see [Set up integrations in the console](integration-console-setup-process.md).

To edit, share, or delete your connector, see [Managing existing integrations](integration-workflows.md#managing-existing-integrations).

### Authentication issues
<a name="airtable-troubleshooting-auth"></a>
+ **Sign-in fails (Default OAuth app or Custom OAuth app)** – Verify that your Airtable account is active and that you can sign in to [airtable.com](https://airtable.com) on the Airtable website directly. For Custom OAuth app, confirm that the redirect URL in your Airtable OAuth integration matches the Amazon Quick callback URL.
+ **Invalid client credentials (Custom OAuth app)** – Verify that the Client ID and Client secret match the values in your Airtable OAuth integration. If you regenerated the client secret, update the value in Amazon Quick.
+ **API Key rejected** – Verify that your personal access token is active and has the required scopes. Tokens can be revoked or expired in the Airtable Builder Hub.
+ **Insufficient permissions** – Verify that the scopes configured for your authentication method include the permissions required for the actions that you want to use. See [Recommended scopes](#airtable-oauth-scopes).
