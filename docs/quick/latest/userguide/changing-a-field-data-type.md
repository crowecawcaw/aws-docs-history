# Changing a field data type

When Quick Sight retrieves data, it assigns each field a data type based on the data
in the field. The possible data types are as follows:

- Date – The date data type is used for date data in a supported format.
  For information about the date formats Quick Sight supports, see [Data source quotas](data-source-limits.md "data-source-limits.md").
- Decimal – The decimal data type is used for numeric data that requires
  one or more decimal places of precision, for example 18.23. The decimal data
  type supports values with up to four decimal places to the right of the decimal
  point. Values that have a higher scale than this are truncated to the fourth
  decimal place in two cases. One is when these values are displayed in data
  preparation or analyses, and one is when these values are imported into
  Quick Sight. For example, 13.00049 is truncated to 13.0004.
- Geospatial – The geospatial data type is used for geospatial data, for
  example longitude and latitude, or cities and countries.
- Integer – The int data type is used for numeric data that only contains
  integers, for example 39.
- String – The string data type is used for nondate alphanumeric
  data.
  Quick Sight reads a small sample of rows in the column to determine the data type.
  The data type that occurs most in the small sample size is the suggested type. In some
  cases, there might be blank values (treated as strings by Quick Sight) in a column that
  contains mostly numbers. In these cases, it might be that the String data type is the
  most frequent type in the sample set of rows. You can manually modify the data type of
  the column to make it integer. Use the following procedures to learn how.

## Changing a field data type during

data prep

During data preparation, you can change the data type of any field from the data
source. On the **Change data type** menu, you can change calculated
fields that don't include aggregations to geospatial types. You can make other
changes to the data type of a calculated field by modifying its expression directly.
Quick Sight converts the field data according to the data type that you choose.
Rows that contain data that is incompatible with that data type are skipped. For
example, suppose that you convert the following field from String to Integer.

```
10020
36803
14267a
98457
78216b
```

All records containing alphabetic characters in that field are skipped, as shown
following.

```
10020
36803
98457
```

If you have a database dataset with fields whose data types aren't supported by
Quick Sight, use a SQL query during data preparation. Then use `CAST` or
`CONVERT` commands (depending on what is supported by the source
database) to change the field data types. For more information about adding a SQL
query during data preparation, see [Using SQL to customize data](adding-a-SQL-query.md "adding-a-SQL-query.md"). For more information about how different
source data types are interpreted by Quick Sight, see [Supported data types from external data
sources](supported-data-types-and-values.md#supported-data-types "supported-data-types-and-values.md#supported-data-types").

You might have numeric fields that act as dimensions rather than metrics, for
example ZIP codes and most ID numbers. In these cases, it's helpful to give
them a string data type during data preparation. Doing this lets Quick Sight
understand that they are not useful for performing mathematical calculations and can
only be aggregated with the `Count` function. For more information about
how Quick Sight uses dimensions and measures, see [Setting fields as a dimensions or
measures](setting-dimension-or-measure.md "setting-dimension-or-measure.md").

In [SPICE](spice.md "spice.md"), numbers converted from
numeric into an integer are truncated by default. If you want to round your numbers
instead, you can create a calculated field using the [round](round-function.md "round-function.md") function. To see whether numbers are rounded or
truncated before they are ingested into SPICE, check your database
engine.

###### To change a field data type during data prep

1. From the Quick Sight homepage, choose **Data** at left.
   In the **Data** tab, choose the dataset that you want, and
   then choose **Edit dataset**.
2. In the data preview pane, choose the data type icon under the field you
   want to change.
3. Choose the target data type. Only data types other than the one currently
   in use are listed.

## Changing a field data type in

an analysis

You can use the **Field list** pane, visual field wells, or
on-visual editors to change numeric field data types within the context of an
analysis. Numeric fields default to displaying as numbers, but you can choose to
have them display as currency or as a percentage instead. You can't change the data
types for string or date fields.

Changing a field's data type in an analysis changes it for all visuals in the
analysis that use that dataset. However, it doesn't change it in the dataset
itself.

###### Note

If you are working in a pivot table visual, applying a table calculation
changes the data type of the cell values in some cases. This type of change
occurs if the data type doesn't make sense with the applied calculation.

For example, suppose that you apply the `Rank` function to a
numeric field that you modified to use a currency data type. In this case, the
cell values display as numbers rather than currency. Similarly, if you apply the
`Percent difference` function instead, the cell values display as
percentages rather than currency.

###### To change a field's data type

1. Choose one of the following options:
   - In the **Field list** pane, hover over the
     numeric field that you want to change. Then choose the selector icon
     to the right of the field name.
   - On any visual that contains an on-visual editor associated with
     the numeric field that you want to change, choose that on-visual
     editor.
   - Expand the **Field wells** pane, and then choose
     the field well associated with the numeric field that you want to
     change.

2. Choose **Show as**, and then choose
   **Number**, **Currency**, or
   **Percent**.
