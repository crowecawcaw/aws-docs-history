# Creating parameter defaults in

Amazon Quick

Use this section to learn more about the types of parameter defaults that are
available, and how to set up each of them.

Each field can have a parameter and a control associated with it. When someone views a
dashboard or email report, any sheet control that has a static default value configured
uses the static default. The default value can change how data is filtered, how custom
actions behave, and what text displays in a dynamic sheet title. Email reports also
support dynamic defaults.

The simplest default is a static (unchanging) default, which shows the same value to
everyone. As the designer of the dashboard, you choose the default value. It can't
be changed by the person using the dashboard. However, that person can choose any value
from the controls. Setting a default doesn't change this. To restrict the values
that a person can select, consider using row-level security. For more information, see
[Using row-level
security with user-based rules to restrict access to a dataset](restrict-access-to-a-data-set-using-row-level-security.md "restrict-access-to-a-data-set-using-row-level-security.md").

###### To create or edit a static default value that applies to everyone's

dashboard view

1. Choose the context menu (`v`) by the parameter that you want to
   edit, or create a new parameter by following the steps in [Setting up parameters in Amazon Quick](parameters-set-up.md "parameters-set-up.md").
2. Enter a value for **Static default value** to set a static
   default.
   To display a different default depending on who is viewing the dashboard, you create a
   dynamic default parameter (DDP). Using dynamic defaults involves some preparation to map
   people to their assigned defaults. First, you need to create a database query or a data
   file that contains information about the people, the fields, and the default values to
   display. You add this to a dataset, then add the dataset to your analysis. Following,
   you can find procedures that you can use to gather information, create the dataset, and
   add the dynamic default to the parameter.

Use the following guidelines when creating a dataset for dynamic default
values:

- We recommend that you use a single dataset to contain all dynamic default
  definitions for a logical grouping of users or groups. If you can, maintain them
  in a single table or file.
- We also recommend that the fields in your dataset have names that closely
  match the field names in the analysis. Not all dataset fields need to be part of
  the analysis, for example if you're using the same dataset for the defaults
  in multiple dashboards. The fields can be in any order.
- We don't recommend that you combine both user and group names in the same
  column or even in the same dataset. This kind of configuration is more work to
  maintain and troubleshoot.
- If you use a comma-delimited file to create your dataset, make sure to remove
  any space between values in the file. The following example shows the correct
  comma-separated value (CSV) format. Enclose text (strings) that include
  nonalphanumeric characters—like spaces, apostrophes, and so on—in
  single or double quotation marks. You can enclose fields that are dates or times
  in quotation marks, but it isn't required. You can enclose numeric fields
  in quotation marks, for example if the numbers contain special characters, as
  shown following.

```
"Value includes spaces","Field contains ' other characters",12345.6789,"20200808"
ValueWithoutSpaces,"1000,67","Value 3",2020-AUG-08
```

- After you create the dataset, make sure to double-check the data types that
  Quick selects for the fields.
  Before you begin, you need a list of the user or group names for the people who are
  going to have dynamic defaults. To generate a list of users or groups, you can use the
  AWS CLI to get the information. To run CLI commands, make sure that you have the AWS CLI
  installed and configured. For more information, see [Installing the
  AWS CLI](../../../cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-install.md "../../../cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-install.md") in the _AWS CLI User Guide_.

This is just one example of how to get a list of user or group names. Use whatever
method works best for you.

###### To identify people for a dynamic default parameter (DDP)

- List either individual user names or group names:

      + To list individual user names, include a column that identifies the
       people for your DDP. This column should contain each person's
       system user name that they use to connect from your identity provider to
       Quick. This user name is often the same as a person's
       email alias before the @ sign, but not always.


      To get a list of users, use the [ListUsers](../../../quicksight/latest/APIReference/API_ListUsers.md "../../../quicksight/latest/APIReference/API_ListUsers.md") Quick API operation or AWS CLI command.
       The CLI command is shown in the following example. Specify the
       AWS Region for your identity provider, for example
       `us-east-1`.



      ```
      awsacct1="`111111111111`"
      namespace="`default`"
      region="`us-east-1`"

      aws quicksight list-users --aws-account-id `$awsacct1` --namespace `$namespace` **--region `$region`**
      ```

      The following example alters the previous command by adding a query
       that limits the results to active users.



      ```
      awsacct1="`111111111111`"
      namespace="`default`"
      region="`us-east-1`"

      aws quicksight list-users --aws-account-id `$awsacct1` --namespace `$namespace` **--region `$region`** --query 'UserList[?Active==`true`]'
      ```

      The result set looks similar to the following sample. This example is
       an excerpt from JSON output (`--output json`). People who
       have federated user names have principal IDs that start with the word
       `federated`.



      ```
      [
          {
              "Arn": "arn:aws:quicksight:us-east-1:111111111111:user/default/anacasilva",
              "UserName": "anacarolinasilva",
              "Email": "anacasilva@example.com",
              "Role": "ADMIN",
              "Active": true,
              "PrincipalId": "**federated**/iam/AIDAJ64EIEIOPX5CEIEIO"
          },
          {
              "Arn": "arn:aws:quicksight:us-east-1:111111111111:user/default/Reader/liujie-stargate",
              "UserName": "Reader/liujie-stargate",
              "Role": "READER",
              "Active": true,
              "PrincipalId": "**federated**/iam/AROAIJSEIEIOMXTZEIEIO:liujie-stargate"
          },
          {
              "Arn": "arn:aws:quicksight:us-east-1:111111111111:user/default/embedding/cxoportal",
              "UserName": "embedding/cxoportal",
              "Email": "saanvisarkar@example.com",
              "Role": "AUTHOR",
              "Active": true,
              "PrincipalId": "**federated**/iam/AROAJTGEIEIOWB6BEIEIO:cxoportal"
          },
          {
              "Arn": "arn:aws:quicksight:us-east-1:111111111111:user/default/zhangwei@example.com",
              "UserName": "zhangwei@example.com",
              "Email": "zhangwei@example.com",
              "Role": "AUTHOR",
              "Active": true,
              "PrincipalId": "**user**/d-96123-example-id-1123"
          }
      ]
      ```
      + To list group names, include a column that identifies the groups
       containing the user names for your DDP. This column should contain the
       system group names that are used to connect from your identity provider
       to Quick. To identify groups that you can add to the
       dataset, use one or more of the following Quick API
       operations or CLI commands:




      	- [ListGroups](../../../quicksight/latest/APIReference/API_ListGroups.md "../../../quicksight/latest/APIReference/API_ListGroups.md") – Lists Quick groups
      	 by AWS account ID and namespace for the AWS Region that
      	 contains your identity provider.
      	- [ListGroupMemberships](../../../quicksight/latest/APIReference/API_ListGroupMemberships.md "../../../quicksight/latest/APIReference/API_ListGroupMemberships.md") – Lists the users in
      	 the specified Quick group.
      	- [ListUserGroups](../../../quicksight/latest/APIReference/API_ListUserGroups.md "../../../quicksight/latest/APIReference/API_ListUserGroups.md") – Lists the Quick
      	 groups that a Quick user is a member of.
      Or you can ask your network administrator to query your identity
       provider to get this information.

  The next two procedures provide instructions on how to finish creating a dataset for
  dynamic default values. The first procedure is for creating a dataset for a single-value
  DDP. The second one is for creating a dataset for a multivalue DDP.

###### To create a dataset for a single-value DDP

1. Create dataset columns with single-value parameters. The first column in the
   query or file should be for the people using the dashboard. This field can
   contain user names or group names. However, support for groups is only available
   in Quick Enterprise edition.
2. For each field that displays a dynamic default for a single-value parameter,
   add a column to the dataset. The name of the column doesn't
   matter—you can use the same name as the field or parameter.

Single-value parameters only work as specified if the combination of user
entity and dynamic default is unique for that parameter's field. If there
are multiple values a default field for a user entity, the single-value control
for that field displays the static default instead. If no static default is
defined, the control doesn't display a default value. Be careful if you use
group names, because some user names can be members of multiple groups. If those
groups have different default values, then this type of user name functions as a
duplicate entry.

The following example shows a table that appears to contain two single-value
parameters. We make this assumption because no user name is paired with multiple
default values. To make this table easier to understand, we add the word
`'default'` in front of the field names from the analysis. Thus,
you can read the table by making the following statement, changing the values
for each row: When viewed by `anacarolinasilva`, the controls display
a default region `NorthEast` and a default segment
`SMB`.

| Viewed-by        | Default-region | Default-segment |
| ---------------- | -------------- | --------------- |
| anacarolinasilva | NorthEast      | SMB             |
| liujie           | SouthEast      | SMB             |
| saanvisarkar     | NorthCentral   | SMB             |
| zhangwei         | SouthCentral   | SMB             |

3. Import this data into Quick, and save it as a new dataset.
4. In your analysis, add the dataset that you created. The analysis needs to use
   at least one other dataset that matches the columns you defined for the
   defaults. For more information, see [Adding a dataset to an
   analysis](adding-a-data-set-to-an-analysis.md "adding-a-data-set-to-an-analysis.md").

###### To create a dataset for a multivalue DDP

1. Create dataset columns with multivalue parameters. The first column in the
   query or file should be for the people using the dashboard. This field can
   contain user names or group names. However, support for groups is only available
   in Quick Enterprise edition.
2. For each field that displays a dynamic default for a multivalue parameter, add
   a column to the dataset. The name of the column doesn't matter—you
   can use the same name as the field or parameter.

Unlike single-value parameters, multivalue parameters allow multiple values in
the field that's associated with the parameter.

The following example shows a table that appears to contain a single-value
parameter and a multivalue parameter. We can make this assumption because each
user name has a unique value in one column, and some user names have multiple
values in the other column. To make this table easier to understand, we add the
word `'default'` in front of the field names from the analysis. Thus,
you can read the table by making the following statement, changing the values
for each row: When `viewed-by` is `liujie`, the controls
display a `default-region` value of `SouthEast`, and a
`default-city` value of `Atlanta`. And if we read
ahead one row, we see that `liujie` also has `Raleigh` in
`default-city`.

| Viewed-by        | Default-region | Default-city |
| ---------------- | -------------- | ------------ |
| anacarolinasilva | NorthEast      | New York     |
| liujie           | SouthEast      | Atlanta      |
| liujie           | SouthEast      | Raleigh      |
| saanvisarkar     | NorthCentral   | Chicago      |
| zhangwei         | SouthCentral   | Dallas       |
| zhangwei         | SouthCentral   | Kansas City  |

In this example, the parameter that we apply `default-region` to
works correctly whether it's a single-value or multivalue parameter. If
it's a single-value parameter, two entries work for one user because both
entries are the same value, `SouthEast`. If it's a multivalue
parameter, it still works, except that only one value is selected by default.
However, if we change the parameter that's using `default-city`
as its default from a multivalue to a single-value parameter, we don't see
these defaults selected. Instead, the parameter uses the static default, if
there is one defined. For example, if the static default is set to
`Atlanta`, `liujie` has `Atlanta` selected
in that control, but not `Raleigh`.

In some cases, your static default value might also be used as a dynamic
default. If so, make sure to test the control for a user name that doesn't
use a default value that can be both.

If a user name belongs to multiple groups, the named user sees a set of
default values that is a union of the two groups' default values. 3. Import this data into Quick, and save it as a new dataset. 4. In your analysis, add the dataset that you created. The analysis needs to use
at least one other dataset that matches the columns you defined for the
defaults. For more information, see [Adding a dataset to an
analysis](adding-a-data-set-to-an-analysis.md "adding-a-data-set-to-an-analysis.md").
Use the following procedure to add a dynamic default parameter to your analysis.
Before you begin, make sure that you have a dataset that contains the dynamic defaults
for each user name or group name. Also make sure that your analysis is using this
dataset. For help with these requirements, see the procedures preceding.

###### To add a DDP to your analysis

1. In the Quick console, choose the **Parameters**
   icon at the top of the page and choose an existing parameter. Choose
   **Edit parameter** from the parameter's menu. To add a
   new parameter, choose the plus (`+`) sign near
   **Parameters**.
2. Choose **Set a dynamic default**.
3. Configure the following options with your settings:
   - **Dataset with default values and user information**
     – Choose the dataset that you created and added to your analysis.
   - **User name column** – To create defaults that
     are based on user names, choose the column in the dataset that contains
     the user names.
   - **Group name column** – To create defaults
     that are based on group names, choose the column in the dataset that
     contains the group names.
   - **Column for default value** – Choose the
     column that contains default values for this parameter.

4. Choose **Apply** to save your setting changes, and then
   choose **Update** to save the parameter changes. To exit
   without saving changes, choose **Cancel** instead.
5. Add a filter for each field that contains dynamic defaults to make the
   defaults work. To learn more about using filters with parameters, see [Using filters with parameters in
   Amazon Quick](parameters-filtering-by.md "parameters-filtering-by.md")

Amazon Quick uses the static default value for anyone whose user name
doesn't exist in the dataset, doesn't have a default assigned, or
doesn't have a unique default. Each person can have only one set of
defaults. If you don't want to use dynamic defaults, you can set a static
default instead.
