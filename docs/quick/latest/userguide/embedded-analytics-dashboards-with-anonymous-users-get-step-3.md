# Step

3: Embed the dashboard URL

###### Important

Amazon Quick Sight has new APIs for embedding analytics:
`GenerateEmbedUrlForAnonymousUser` and
`GenerateEmbedUrlForRegisteredUser`.

You can still use the `GetDashboardEmbedUrl` and
`GetSessionEmbedUrl` APIs to embed dashboards and the
Amazon Quick Sight console, but they do not contain the latest embedding
capabilities. For the latest up-to-date embedding experience, see [Embedding Amazon Quick Sight analytics into your
applications](../../../quicksight/latest/user/embedding-overview.md "../../../quicksight/latest/user/embedding-overview.md").

In the following section, you can find out how you can use the [Amazon Quick Sight embedding SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/amazon-quicksight-embedding-sdk "https://www.npmjs.com/package/amazon-quicksight-embedding-sdk") (JavaScript) to embed the dashboard URL
from step 2 in your website or application page. With the SDK, you can do the
following:

- Place the dashboard on an HTML page.
- Pass parameters into the dashboard.
- Handle error states with messages that are customized to your
  application.
  Call the `GetDashboardEmbedUrl` API operation to get the URL that you
  can embed in your app. This URL is valid for 5 minutes, and the resulting session is
  valid for 10 hours. The API operation provides the URL with an
  `auth_code` that enables a single-sign on session.

The following shows an example response from
`get-dashboard-embed-url`.

```
//The URL returned is over 900 characters. For this example, we've shortened the string for
//readability and added ellipsis to indicate that it's incomplete.
{
     "Status": "200",
     "EmbedUrl": "https: //dashboards.example.com/embed/620bef10822743fab329fb3751187d2d...",
     "RequestId": "7bee030e-f191-45c4-97fe-d9faf0e03713"
}
```

Embed this dashboard in your web page by using the Amazon Quick Sight [Embedding
SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/amazon-quicksight-embedding-sdk "https://www.npmjs.com/package/amazon-quicksight-embedding-sdk") or by adding this URL into an iframe. If you set a fixed height and
width number (in pixels), Amazon Quick Sight uses those and doesn't change your
visual as your window resizes. If you set a relative percent height and width,
Amazon Quick Sight provides a responsive layout that is modified as your window size
changes. By using the Amazon Quick Sight Embedding SDK, you can also control
parameters within the dashboard and receive callbacks in terms of page load
completion and errors.

The following example shows how to use the generated URL. This code resides on
your app server.

```

    <!-- You can download the latest QuickSight embedding SDK version from https://www.npmjs.com/package/amazon-quicksight-embedding-sdk -->
    <!-- Or you can do "npm install amazon-quicksight-embedding-sdk", if you use npm for javascript dependencies -->
    <script src="./quicksight-embedding-js-sdk.min.js"></script>
    <script type="text/javascript">
        var dashboard;

        function embedDashboard() {
            var containerDiv = document.getElementById("embeddingContainer");
            var options = {
                // replace this dummy url with the one generated via embedding API
                url: "https://us-east-1.quicksight.aws.amazon.com/sn/dashboards/dashboardId?isauthcode=true&identityprovider=quicksight&code=authcode",
                container: containerDiv,
                scrolling: "no",
                height: "700px",
                width: "1000px",
                footerPaddingEnabled: true
            };
            dashboard = QuickSightEmbedding.embedDashboard(options);
        }
    </script>
</head>

<body onload="embedDashboard()">
    <div id="embeddingContainer"></div>
</body>

```

For this example to work, make sure to use the Amazon Quick Sight Embedding SDK to load
the embedded dashboard on your website using JavaScript. To get your copy, do one of
the following:

- Download the [Amazon Quick Sight embedding SDK](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-quicksight-embedding-sdk#step-3-create-the-quicksight-session-object "https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-quicksight-embedding-sdk#step-3-create-the-quicksight-session-object") from GitHub. This repository is
  maintained by a group of Amazon Quick Sight developers.
- Download the latest QuickSight embedding SDK version from [https://www.npmjs.com/package/amazon-quicksight-embedding-sdk](https://www.npmjs.com/package/amazon-quicksight-embedding-sdk "https://www.npmjs.com/package/amazon-quicksight-embedding-sdk").
- If you use `npm` for JavaScript dependencies, download and
  install it by running the following command.

```
npm install amazon-quicksight-embedding-sdk
```
