# Running queries as an IAM role in

Amazon Quick

You can enhance data security by using fine-grained access policies rather than broader
permissions for data sources connected to Amazon Athena, Amazon Redshift or Amazon S3. You start by creating an
AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role with permissions to be activated when a person or an API starts a
query. Then, an Quick administrator or a developer assigns the IAM Role to an
Athena or Amazon S3 data source. With the role in place, any person or API that runs the query has
the exact permissions necessary to run the query.

Here are some things to consider before you commit to implementing run-as roles to enhance
data security:

- Articulate how the additional security works to your advantage.
- Work with your Quick administrator to learn if adding roles to data
  sources helps you to better meet your security goals or requirements.
- Ask if this type of security, for the number of data sources and people and
  applications involved, can be feasibly documented and maintained by your team? If
  not, then who will undertake that part of the work?
- In a structured organization, locate stakeholders in parallel teams in Operations,
  Development, and IT Support. Ask for their experience, advice, and willingness to
  support your plan.
- Before you launch your project, consider doing a proof of concept that involves
  the people who need access to the data.
  The following rules apply to using run-as roles with Athena, Amazon Redshift, and Amazon S3:

- Each data source can have only one associated RoleArn. Consumers of the data
  source, who typically access datasets and visuals, can generate many different types
  of queries. The role places boundaries on which queries work and which don't
  work.
- The ARN must correspond to an IAM role in the same AWS account as the
  Quick instance that uses it.
- The IAM role must have a trust relationship allowing Quick to assume
  the role.
- The identity that calls Quick's APIs must have permission to pass
  the role before they can update the `RoleArn` property. You only need to
  pass the role when creating or updating the role ARN. The permissions aren't
  re-evaluated later on. Similarly, the permission isn't required when the role ARN is
  omitted.
- When the role ARN is omitted, the Athena or Amazon S3 data source uses the account-wide
  role and scope-down policies.
- When the role ARN is present, the account-wide role and any scope-down policies
  are both ignored. For Athena data sources, Lake Formation permissions are not
  ignored.
- For Amazon S3 data sources, both the manifest file and the data specified by the
  manifest file must be accessible using the IAM role.
- The ARN string needs to match an existing IAM role in the AWS account and
  AWS Region where the data is located and queried.
  When Quick connects to another service in AWS, it uses an IAM role. By
  default, this less granular version of the role is created by Quick for each
  service it uses, and the role is managed by AWS account administrators. When you add an
  IAM role ARN with a custom permissions policy, you override the broader role for your data
  sources that need extra protection. For more information about policies, see [Create a
  customer managed policy](../../../IAM/latest/UserGuide/tutorial_managed-policies.md "../../../IAM/latest/UserGuide/tutorial_managed-policies.md") in the IAM User Guide.

## Run queries with Athena data

sources

Use the API to attach the ARN to the Athena data source. To do so, add the role ARN in
the [RoleArn](../../../quicksight/latest/APIReference/API_RoleArn.md "../../../quicksight/latest/APIReference/API_RoleArn.md") property of [AthenaParameters](../../../quicksight/latest/APIReference/API_AthenaParameters.md "../../../quicksight/latest/APIReference/API_AthenaParameters.md"). For verification, you can see the role ARN on the
**Edit Athena data source** dialog box. However, **Role
ARN** is a read-only field.

To get started, you need a custom IAM role, which we demonstrate in the following
example.

Keep in mind that the following code example is for learning purposes only. Use this
example in a temporary development and testing environment only, and not in a production
environment. The policy in this example doesn't secure any specific resource, which
must be in a deployable policy. Also, even for development, you need to add your own
AWS account information.

The following commands create a simple new role and attach a few policies that grant
permissions to Quick.

```
aws iam create-role \
        --role-name TestAthenaRoleForQuickSight \
        --description "Test Athena Role For QuickSight" \
        --assume-role-policy-document '{
            "Version": "2012-10-17"		 	 	 ,
            "Statement": [
                {
                    "Effect": "Allow",
                    "Principal": {
                        "Service": "quicksight.amazonaws.com"
                    },
                    "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
                }
            ]
        }'
```

After you've identified or created an IAM role to use with each data source, attach
the policies by using the attach-role-policy.

```
aws iam attach-role-policy \
        --role-name TestAthenaRoleForQuickSight \
        --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::222222222222:policy/service-role/AWSQuickSightS3Policy1

    aws iam attach-role-policy \
        --role-name TestAthenaRoleForQuickSight \
        --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/service-role/AWSQuicksightAthenaAccess1

    aws iam attach-role-policy \
        --role-name TestAthenaRoleForQuickSight \
        --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonS3Access1
```

After you verify your permissions, you can use the role in Quick data
sources by creating a new role or updating an existing role. When using these commands,
update the AWS account ID and AWS Region to match your own.

Remember, these example code snippets are not for production environments. AWS
strongly recommends that you identify and use a set of least privilege policies for your
production cases.

```
aws quicksight create-data-source
        --aws-account-id 222222222222 \
        --region us-east-1 \
        --data-source-id "athena-with-custom-role" \
        --cli-input-json '{
            "Name": "Athena with a custom Role",
            "Type": "ATHENA",
            "data sourceParameters": {
                "AthenaParameters": {
                    "RoleArn": "arn:aws:iam::222222222222:role/TestAthenaRoleForQuickSight"
                }
            }
        }'
```

## Run queries with Amazon Redshift data

sources

Connect your Amazon Redshift data with the run-as role to enhance your data security with
fine-grained access policies. You can create a run-as role for Amazon Redshift data sources that
use a public network or a VPC connection. You specify the connection type that you want
to use in the **Edit Amazon Redshift data source** dialog box. The run-as role is
not supported for Amazon Redshift Serverless data sources.

To get started, you need a custom IAM role, which we demonstrate in the following
example. The following commands create a sample new role and attach policies that grant
permissions to Quick.

```
aws iam create-role \
--role-name TestRedshiftRoleForQuickSight \
--description "Test Redshift Role For QuickSight" \
--assume-role-policy-document '{
    "Version": "2012-10-17"		 	 	 ,
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "Service": "quicksight.amazonaws.com"
            },
            "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
        }
    ]
}'
```

After you identify or create an IAM role to use with each data source, attach the
policies with an `attach-role-policy`. If the
`redshift:GetClusterCredentialsWithIAM` permission is attached to the
role that you want to use, the values for `DatabaseUser` and
`DatabaseGroups` are optional.

```
aws iam attach-role-policy \
--role-name TestRedshiftRoleForQuickSight \
--policy-arn arn:aws:iam:111122223333:policy/service-role/AWSQuickSightRedshiftPolicy


aws iam create-policy --policy-name RedshiftGetClusterCredentialsPolicy1 \
--policy-document file://redshift-get-cluster-credentials-policy.json


aws iam attach-role-policy \
--role-name TestRedshiftRoleForQuickSight \
--policy-arn arn:aws:iam:111122223333:policy/RedshiftGetClusterCredentialsPolicy1
// redshift-get-cluster-credentials-policy.json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17"		 	 	 ,
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "RedshiftGetClusterCredentialsPolicy",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "redshift:GetClusterCredentials"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "*"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

The example above creates a data source that uses the `RoleARN`,
`DatabaseUser`, and `DatabaseGroups` IAM parameters. If you
want to establish the connection only through the IAM `RoleARN` parameter,
attach the `redshift:GetClusterCredentialsWithIAM` permission to your role,
shown in the example below.

```
aws iam attach-role-policy \
--role-name TestRedshiftRoleForQuickSight \
--policy-arn arn:aws:iam:111122223333:policy/RedshiftGetClusterCredentialsPolicy1 // redshift-get-cluster-credentials-policy.json {
    "Version": "2012-10-17"		 	 	 ,
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "RedshiftGetClusterCredentialsPolicy",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [ "redshift:GetClusterCredentialsWithIAM" ],
            "Resource": [ "*" ]
        }
    ]
}"
```

After you verify your permissions, you can use the role in Quick data
sources by creating a new role or updating an existing role. When using these commands,
update the AWS account ID and AWS Region to match your own.

```
aws quicksight create-data-source \
--region us-west-2 \
--endpoint https://quicksight.us-west-2.quicksight.aws.com/ \
--cli-input-json file://redshift-data-source-iam.json \
redshift-data-source-iam.json is shown as below
{
    "AwsAccountId": "`AWSACCOUNTID`",
    "DataSourceId": "`DATSOURCEID`",
    "Name": "`Test redshift demo iam`",
    "Type": "REDSHIFT",
    "DataSourceParameters": {
        "RedshiftParameters": {
            "Database": "integ",
            "Host": "redshiftdemocluster.us-west-2.redshift.amazonaws.com",
            "Port": `8192`,
            "ClusterId": "`redshiftdemocluster`",
            "IAMParameters": {
                "RoleArn": "arn:aws:iam::`222222222222`:role/`TestRedshiftRoleForQuickSight`",
                "DatabaseUser": "user",
                "DatabaseGroups": ["`admin_group`", "`guest_group`", "`guest_group_1`"]
            }
        }
    },
    "Permissions": [
      {
        "Principal": "arn:aws:quicksight:us-east-1:`AWSACCOUNTID`:user/default/`demoname`",
        "Actions": [
          "quicksight:DescribeDataSource",
          "quicksight:DescribeDataSourcePermissions",
          "quicksight:PassDataSource",
          "quicksight:UpdateDataSource",
          "quicksight:DeleteDataSource",
          "quicksight:UpdateDataSourcePermissions"
        ]
      }
    ]
}
```

If your data source uses the VPC connection type, use the following VPC
configuration.

```
{
    "AwsAccountId": "`AWSACCOUNTID`",
    "DataSourceId": "`DATSOURCEID`",
    "Name": "`Test redshift demo iam vpc`",
    "Type": "REDSHIFT",
    "DataSourceParameters": {
        "RedshiftParameters": {
            "Database": "`mydb`",
            "Host": "`vpcdemo.us-west-2.redshift.amazonaws.com`",
            "Port": `8192`,
            "ClusterId": "`vpcdemo`",
            "IAMParameters": {
                "RoleArn": "arn:aws:iam::`222222222222`:role/`TestRedshiftRoleForQuickSight`",
                "DatabaseUser": "`user`",
                "AutoCreateDatabaseUser": true
            }
        }
    },
    "VpcConnectionProperties": {
      "VpcConnectionArn": "arn:aws:quicksight:us-west-2:`222222222222`:vpcConnection/`VPC Name`"
    },
    "Permissions": [
      {
        "Principal": "arn:aws:quicksight:us-east-1:`222222222222`:user/default/`demoname`",
        "Actions": [
          "quicksight:DescribeDataSource",
          "quicksight:DescribeDataSourcePermissions",
          "quicksight:PassDataSource",
          "quicksight:UpdateDataSource",
          "quicksight:DeleteDataSource",
          "quicksight:UpdateDataSourcePermissions"
        ]
      }
    ]
}
```

If your data source uses the `redshift:GetClusterCredentialsWithIAM`
permission and doesn't use the `DatabaseUser` or
`DatabaseGroups` parameters, grant the role access to some or all tables
in the schema. To see if a role has been granted `SELECT` permissions to a
specific table, input the following command into the Amazon Redshift Query Editor.

```
SELECT
u.usename,
t.schemaname||'.'||t.tablename,
has_table_privilege(u.usename,t.tablename,'select') AS user_has_select_permission
FROM
pg_user u
CROSS JOIN
pg_tables t
WHERE
u.usename = 'IAMR:`RoleName`'
AND t.tablename = `tableName`
```

For more information about the `SELECT` action in the Amazon Redshift Query Editor,
see [SELECT](../../../redshift/latest/dg/r_SELECT_synopsis.md "../../../redshift/latest/dg/r_SELECT_synopsis.md").

To grant `SELECT` permisions to the role, input the following command in
the Amazon Redshift Query Editor.

```
GRANT SELECT ON { [ TABLE ] table_name [, ...] | ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA
schema_name [, ...] } TO "IAMR:`Rolename`";

```

For more information about the `GRANT` action in the Amazon Redshift Query Editor, see
[GRANT](../../../redshift/latest/dg/r_GRANT.md "../../../redshift/latest/dg/r_GRANT.md").

## Run queries with Amazon S3 data sources

Amazon S3 data sources contain a manifest file that Quick uses to find and
parse your data. You can upload a JSON manifest file through the Quick
console, or you can provide a URL that points to a JSON file in an S3 bucket. If you
choose to provide a URL, Quick must be granted permission to access the file
in Amazon S3. Use the Quick administration console to control access to the
manifest file and the data that it references.

With the **RoleArn** property, you can grant access to the manifest
file and the data that it references through a custom IAM role that overrides the
account-wide role. Use the API to attach the ARN to the manifest file of the Amazon S3 data
source. To do so, include the role ARN in the [RoleArn](../../../quicksight/latest/APIReference/API_RoleArn.md "../../../quicksight/latest/APIReference/API_RoleArn.md") property of
[S3Parameters](../../../quicksight/latest/APIReference/API_S3Parameters.md "../../../quicksight/latest/APIReference/API_S3Parameters.md"). For
verification, you can see the role ARN in the **Edit S3 data source**
dialog box. However, **Role ARN** is a read-only field, as shown in the
following screenshot.

To get started, create an Amazon S3 manifest file. Then, you can either upload it to
Amazon Quick when you create a new Amazon S3 dataset or place the file into the Amazon S3 bucket
that contains your data files. View the following example to see what a manifest file
might look like:

```
{
    "fileLocations": [
        {
            "URIPrefixes": [
                "s3://quicksightUser-run-as-role/data/"
            ]
        }
    ],
    "globalUploadSettings": {
        "format": "CSV",
        "delimiter": ",",
        "textqualifier": "'",
        "containsHeader": "true"
    }
}
```

For instructions on how to create a manifest file, see [Supported formats for Amazon S3 manifest
files](supported-manifest-file-format.md "supported-manifest-file-format.md").

After you have created a manifest file and added it to your Amazon S3 bucket or uploaded it
to Quick, create or update an existing role in IAM that grants
`s3:GetObject` access. The following example illustrates how to update an
existing IAM role with the AWS API:

```
aws iam put-role-policy \
    --role-name QuickSightAccessToS3RunAsRoleBucket \
    --policy-name GrantS3RunAsRoleAccess \
    --policy-document '{
        "Version": "2012-10-17"		 	 	 ,
        "Statement": [
            {
                "Effect": "Allow",
                "Action": "s3:ListBucket",
                "Resource": "`arn:aws:s3:::s3-bucket-name`"
            },
            {
                "Effect": "Allow",
                "Action": "s3:GetObject",
                "Resource": "`arn:aws:s3:::s3-bucket-name/manifest.json`"
            },
            {
                "Effect": "Allow",
                "Action": "s3:GetObject",
                "Resource": "`arn:aws:s3:::s3-bucket-name/*`"
            }
        ]
    }'
```

After your policy grants `s3:GetObject` access, you can begin creating data
sources that apply the updated `put-role-policy` to the Amazon S3 data
source's manifest file.

```
aws quicksight create-data-source --aws-account-id `111222333444` --region `us-west-2` --endpoint `https://quicksight.us-west-2.quicksight.aws.com/` \
    --data-source-id "`s3-run-as-role-demo-source`" \
    --cli-input-json '{
        "Name": "`S3 with a custom Role`",
        "Type": "S3",
        "DataSourceParameters": {
            "S3Parameters": {
                "RoleArn": "`arn:aws:iam::111222333444:role/QuickSightAccessRunAsRoleBucket`",
                "ManifestFileLocation": {
                    "Bucket": "`s3-bucket-name`",
                    "Key": "`manifest.json`"
                }
            }
        }
    }'
```

After you verify your permissions, you can use the role in Quick data
sources, either by creating a new role or updating an existing role. When using these
commands, be sure to update the AWS account ID and AWS Region to match your own.
