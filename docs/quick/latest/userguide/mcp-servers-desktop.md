# Configuring MCP servers

The Amazon Quick desktop application supports the Model Context Protocol (MCP), an
open standard that extends the capabilities of Quick with custom tools
and integrations. You can connect MCP servers to give Quick access to
databases, internal APIs, developer tools, and other systems that are not available
through built-in connections.

## What is MCP?

Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a protocol that allows AI assistants to
interact with external tools and data sources. When you connect an MCP server to
Quick, the tools provided by that server become available in your
chat conversations and scheduled agents. For example, you can connect an MCP
server that provides database query tools, and then ask Quick to
query your database directly in chat.

## Accessing MCP settings

To manage your MCP servers, open **Settings** in
the sidebar, choose **Capabilities**, and then
choose the **MCP** tab.

The MCP tab displays your connected servers with a search bar, filter
dropdown, and grid or list view toggle. You can add new servers by choosing
**+ Add MCP**.

## Adding an MCP server

When you choose **+ Add MCP**, a dialog appears
with three connection types: **Local**, **Import**, and **Remote**. Choose the connection type that matches how your MCP server
runs.

### Local

Use the **Local** connection type to run an
MCP server as a command on your machine. This is the most common option for
development tools and locally installed servers.

The following table describes the fields for a Local MCP
connection.

| Field                        | Required | Description                                                                                                                              |
| ---------------------------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Name**                     | Yes      | A friendly name to identify this MCP server (for<br>example, "My Database MCP").                                                         |
| **Command**                  | Yes      | The executable to run. Common values include<br>`python`, `npx`,<br>`node`, and `uvx`.                                                   |
| **Arguments**                | No       | Command line arguments, separated by spaces (for<br>example, `-m mcp_server --port 8080`).                                               |
| **Description**              | No       | A description of what this MCP server does and what<br>tools it provides. This helps Quick<br>understand when to use the server's tools. |
| **Environment<br>variables** | No       | Environment variables required by the server. Choose<br>\*_+ Add variable_<br>• to add<br>key-value pairs.                               |
| **Timeout<br>(seconds)**     | No       | Maximum time to wait for the server to start, from 5<br>to 300 seconds. The default is 30 seconds.                                       |

###### To add a local MCP server

Use the following procedure.

1. Open **Settings** in the sidebar
   and choose **Capabilities**.
2. Choose the **MCP** tab.
3. Choose **+ Add MCP**.
4. Choose **Local** as the connection
   type.
5. Enter a **Name** and the
   **Command** to run (for example,
   `python`).
6. Enter any **Arguments** the
   command requires (for example,
   `-m my_mcp_server`).
7. Choose **+ Add MCP** to
   save.

### Import

Use the **Import** connection type to load
MCP server configurations from an existing configuration file. This is
useful when you already have MCP servers configured for other tools and
want to reuse that configuration in Quick.

Quick supports configuration files from the following
tools.

- Kiro
- Claude Code
- AIM
- Antigravity
- QuickWork exports

The following table describes the fields for an Import MCP
connection.

| Field                   | Required | Description                                                                                          |
| ----------------------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Config file<br>path** | Yes      | The path to the configuration file on your machine<br>(for example,<br>`~/.kiro/settings/mcp.json`). |

When you enter a configuration file path, Quick automatically
scans the file and detects the MCP servers defined in it.
Quick also detects tools installed on your system and displays
them as chips (for example, "Kiro", "AIM", "Claude Code") under
**Detected on this system**.

###### To import MCP servers from a config file

Use the following procedure.

1. Open **Settings** in the sidebar
   and choose **Capabilities**.
2. Choose the **MCP** tab.
3. Choose **+ Add MCP**.
4. Choose **Import** as the connection
   type.
5. Enter the **Config file path** to
   your existing MCP configuration file.
6. Review the detected servers and system tools.
7. Choose **Load file** to import the
   servers.

### Remote

Use the **Remote** connection type to
connect to an MCP server running on a remote machine or cloud service over
HTTP. This is useful for shared team servers or hosted MCP
services.

The following table describes the fields for a Remote MCP
connection.

| Field                    | Required | Description                                                                                          |
| ------------------------ | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Name**                 | Yes      | A friendly name to identify this MCP server.                                                         |
| **URL**                  | Yes      | The URL of the MCP endpoint (for example,<br>`https://mcp.example.com/sse`).                         |
| **Token**                | No       | A bearer token for authentication with the remote<br>server.                                         |
| **Description**          | No       | A description of what this MCP server does and what<br>tools it provides.                            |
| **Timeout<br>(seconds)** | No       | Maximum time to wait for the server to respond, from<br>5 to 300 seconds. The default is 30 seconds. |

###### To add a remote MCP server

Use the following procedure.

1. Open **Settings** in the sidebar
   and choose **Capabilities**.
2. Choose the **MCP** tab.
3. Choose **+ Add MCP**.
4. Choose **Remote** as the connection
   type.
5. Enter a **Name** and the
   **URL** of the MCP
   endpoint.
6. (Optional) Enter a **Token** if
   the server requires authentication.
7. Choose **+ Add MCP** to
   save.

## Managing MCP servers

After you add MCP servers, they appear on the MCP tab. You can manage your
servers using the following features.

- **Search** – Use the search bar
  to find servers by name.
- **Filter** – Use the dropdown
  filter to show all servers or filter by status.
- **View toggle** – Switch between
  grid view and list view.
- **Toggle** – Turn individual MCP
  servers on or off without removing them.
- **Edit** – Modify server
  configuration.
- **Remove** – Delete a server
  connection.

## Coding agents

The MCP tab also includes a **Coding agents**
section below the MCP servers. Coding agents use the Agent Client Protocol
(ACP) to delegate coding tasks to local coding agents such as Kiro or Claude
Code.

###### To add a coding agent

Use the following procedure.

1. Open **Settings** in the sidebar and
   choose **Capabilities**.
2. Choose the **MCP** tab.
3. In the **Coding agents** section,
   choose **+ Add Agent**.
4. Configure the agent connection settings.
5. Save the configuration.

After you configure a coding agent, you can delegate tasks to it from chat.
For example, you can say "use Kiro to refactor this module" or "ask Claude Code
to write tests for this function." Quick dispatches the work to the
coding agent and reports the results back to you.

## Using MCP tools in scheduled agents

You can attach MCP servers to scheduled agents as capabilities. When you
create or edit a scheduled agent, you can select which MCP servers the agent has
access to. This allows your automated agents to use custom tools when they run
on their schedule.

To attach MCP capabilities to a scheduled agent, open the agent in
**Settings** > **Capabilities** > **Scheduled
tasks**, choose the **Capabilities** tab
for that agent, and select the MCP servers you want to make available.

###### Note

MCP servers must be running and accessible when a scheduled agent
attempts to use their tools. For local MCP servers, the server process
starts automatically when needed. For remote servers, verify that the
server is online and reachable.
