# Skills and agents

The Amazon Quick desktop application supports skills and scheduled agents that extend
what Quick can do on your behalf. Skills are modular instruction sets that
equip Quick with specialized capabilities, and scheduled agents run tasks
automatically on a recurring basis.

## Skills

A skill is a self-contained instruction set that Quick loads on
demand to perform a specific type of task. Each skill includes a name, a
description, detailed step-by-step instructions, and can optionally include
attached tools and reference files. When you invoke a skill, Quick
loads its instructions and tools into the active conversation, giving it the
specialized knowledge and capabilities needed to complete the task.

Skills are more than simple prompt templates. A skill can define the
following components.

- **Instructions** – A structured
  `SKILL.md` file with detailed, multi-step workflows,
  validation criteria, and failure-handling guidance.
- **Tools** – One or more callable
  tools that the skill makes available to Quick. For example,
  the Coding Agents (ACP) skill includes a `Send Message To Acp
Agent` tool, and the Agent Management skill includes 17 tools for
  creating, updating, and managing scheduled agents.
- **Reference files** – Supporting
  documents, templates, or configuration files that the skill can access
  during execution.

### Built-in skills

Amazon Quick on desktop comes with built-in skills that are
pre-installed and ready to use. You can toggle built-in skills on or off as

###### Note

The number of built-in skills and their capabilities might change as
Amazon Quick is updated. The skills listed in the preceding table
reflect the current preview release.

### Creating a skill

You can create custom skills in the Amazon Quick desktop application
using one of the following methods.

###### To create a skill with AI

Use the following procedure.

1. Open **Settings** in the
   sidebar.
2. Choose **Capabilities**, and then
   choose the **Skills** tab.
3. Under **MY SKILLS**, choose
   **Create with AI**.
4. Describe the skill you want to create. Quick
   generates the skill instructions, selects appropriate tools, and
   creates the `SKILL.md` file.
5. Review and edit the generated skill before saving.

###### To upload a skill file

Use the following procedure.

1. Open **Settings** in the
   sidebar.
2. Choose **Capabilities**, and then
   choose the **Skills** tab.
3. Under **MY SKILLS**, choose
   **Upload**.
4. Select a `SKILL.md` file from your local
   machine.
5. Review and edit the uploaded skill before saving.

Skills that you create appear under the **MY
SKILLS** section in the Skills tab.

###### Tip

When you complete a multi-step task successfully, Quick
might offer to save the workflow as a reusable skill. This is a
convenient way to capture effective workflows without writing
instructions manually.

### Using a skill

You can use a skill in one of the following ways.

- **By name** – Mention the
  skill by name in your chat message. For example, enter "use the
  Web Browser skill to check this page" or "create a
  presentation."
- **Automatic selection** –
  Quick automatically detects when a skill is relevant
  to your request and loads it without you needing to ask. For
  example, if you ask Quick to create a PowerPoint
  file, the Presentations skill loads automatically.
- **Run button** – In the
  Skills tab, choose a skill and then choose **Run** to start a conversation with the skill already
  loaded.

When a skill activates, its tools load automatically into the
conversation. You can see which tools are available in the skill's detail
view.

### Managing skills

You can manage your skills from **Settings**

> **Capabilities** > **Skills**.

- **Search** – Use the search
  bar to find skills by name or description.
- **Toggle built-in skills** –
  Use the master toggle next to **BUILT-IN
  SKILLS** to enable or disable all built-in skills at
  once.
- **View details** – Choose a
  skill to view its description, attached tools and files, and full
  instructions.
- **Edit instructions** –
  Choose **Edit** in a skill's detail
  view to modify its instructions.
- **Run** – Choose **Run** to start a new conversation with the
  skill pre-loaded.

The Skills tab also displays a **How skills
work** guide at the top of the page with the following three
steps.

1. **Create a skill** – Write
   instructions, attach tools, and add reference files. Each skill
   is a folder that Quick loads on demand.
2. **Invoke in chat** – Mention
   a skill by name or let Quick auto-select it. Tools
   load automatically when the skill activates.
3. **Iterate and refine** –
   Edit instructions, add sub-files for edge cases, or attach skills
   to scheduled tasks so they run on autopilot.

## Scheduled agents

Scheduled agents are automated tasks that run on a recurring schedule. You
define what the agent does, when it runs, what capabilities it uses, and which
AI model powers it. Quick runs the agent at the specified times and
delivers the results to your activity feed.

### How scheduled agents work

Each scheduled agent is configured with four components, accessible
through tabs in the agent detail view.

| Tab              | Description                                                                                    |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Overview**     | Summary of the agent's type, source, schedule,<br>capabilities, and model.                     |
| **Schedule**     | Configure when and how often the agent runs (for<br>example, every 15 minutes, daily, weekly). |
| **Capabilities** | Attach MCP servers to give the agent access to<br>additional tools and data sources.           |
| **Prompt**       | Define the agent's instructions — what it does<br>each time it runs.                           |

The Overview tab displays the following information.

| Field        | Description                                                |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Type         | The agent's category (for example, Feed).                  |
| Source       | Whether the agent is Built-in or custom.                   |
| Schedule     | How often the agent runs (for example, Every 15<br>min).   |
| Capabilities | The number of MCP servers attached to the<br>agent.        |
| Model        | The AI model the agent uses (Fast, Balanced, or<br>Smart). |

### Built-in agents

Amazon Quick on desktop includes pre-configured agents that are ready to
use. The following table describes the built-in agents.

| Agent      | Schedule         | Description                                                                                                                                                                     |
| ---------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Feed Agent | Every 15 minutes | Processes items from your connected services<br>(messaging, email, calendar) and populates the activity<br>feed with prioritized, AI-summarized items and suggested<br>actions. |

Built-in agents are pre-configured with sensible defaults, but you can
customize their schedule, capabilities, prompt, and model
selection.

### Creating a scheduled agent

You can create a scheduled agent using one of the following
methods.

###### To create an agent from Settings

Use the following procedure.

1. Open **Settings** in the
   sidebar.
2. Choose **Capabilities**, and then
   choose the **Scheduled tasks**
   tab.
3. Choose **Create agent** or follow
   the on-screen prompts to define a new agent.
4. Configure the agent's schedule, capabilities, prompt, and
   model.
5. Toggle the agent on when you're ready for it to start
   running.

###### To create an agent from chat

You can ask Quick to create a scheduled agent directly
in chat. For example:

- "Create an agent that checks my Slack channels every morning at
  9 AM and summarizes what I missed."
- "Set up a daily agent to monitor my inbox for urgent
  emails."

Quick creates the agent and adds it to your Scheduled
Tasks.

### Agent controls

Each scheduled agent provides the following controls.

| Control | Icon   | Description                                                                           |
| ------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Edit    | Pencil | Open the agent configuration for editing.                                             |
| Run now | Play   | Run the agent immediately, regardless of its<br>schedule.                             |
| Toggle  | Switch | Turn the agent on or off. When off, the agent does<br>not run at its scheduled times. |

You can also select which AI model the agent uses. Choose from
**Fast**, **Balanced**, or **Smart** based on
the complexity of the agent's task and your preferences for speed versus
quality.

### Accessing scheduled agents

You can access your scheduled agents from two locations.

- **Agents panel** – Choose
  **Agents** in the top bar to open a
  quick-access overlay panel. This panel displays all your agents
  with their schedule, status, and a toggle to turn them on or
  off.
- **Settings** – Open
  **Settings** > **Capabilities** > **Scheduled Tasks** for full agent management, including
  editing, creating, and configuring agent details.

###### Important

Scheduled agents run locally on your computer. Your computer must be
turned on and the Amazon Quick desktop application must be running for
scheduled agents to execute at their configured times. If your computer
is off or the application is closed when an agent is scheduled to run,
the agent does not run until the next scheduled time.

### Examples of scheduled agents

The following are examples of scheduled agents you can create.

- **Morning brief** – Every
  morning at 8 AM, summarize unread Slack messages, new emails, and
  today's calendar events.
- **Inbox triage** – Every 30
  minutes, scan new emails and flag anything that needs urgent
  attention.
- **Project monitor** – Daily
  at 5 PM, check a Slack channel for updates on a specific project
  and compile a summary.
- **Meeting prep** – 15 minutes
  before each calendar meeting, gather relevant context from Slack,
  email, and files, and prepare a brief.
- **Competitive monitor** –
  Weekly, search the web for news about specified companies and
  produce a summary report.
