# Creating a data source and data set

from SaaS sources

To analyze and report on data from software as a service (SaaS) applications, you can
use SaaS connectors to access your data directly from Quick Sight. The SaaS connectors
simplify accessing third-party application sources using OAuth, without
any need to export the data to an intermediate data store.

You can use either a cloud-based or server-based instance of a SaaS application. To
connect to an SaaS application that is running on your corporate network, make sure that
Quick Sight can access the application's Domain Name System (DNS) name over the
network. If Quick Sight can't access the SaaS application, it generates an unknown host
error.

Here are examples of some ways that you can use SaaS data:

- Engineering teams who use Jira to track issues and bugs can report on
  developer efficiency and bug burndown.
- Marketing organizations can integrate Quick Sight with Adobe Analytics to
  build consolidated dashboards to visualize their online and web marketing
  data.
  Use the following procedure to create a data source and dataset by connecting to
  sources available through Software as a Service (SaaS). In this procedure, we use a
  connection to GitHub as an example. Other SaaS data sources follow the same process,
  although the screens—especially the SaaS screens—might look
  different.

###### To create a data source and dataset by connecting to sources through SaaS

1. On the Quick start page, choose **Data**.
2. On the **Data** page, choose **Create**
   then choose **New dataset**.
3. Choose the icon that represents the SaaS source that you want to use. For
   example, you might choose Adobe Analytics or GitHub.

For sources using OAuth, the connector takes you to the SaaS
site to authorize the connection before you can create the data source. 4. Choose a name for the data source, and enter that. If there are more screen
prompts, enter the appropriate information. Then choose **Create data
source**. 5. If you are prompted to do so, enter your credentials on the SaaS login
page. 6. When prompted, authorize the connection between your SaaS data source and
Quick Sight.

The following example shows the authorization for Quick Sight to access the
GitHub account for the Quick Sight documentation.

###### Note

Quick Sight documentation is now available on GitHub. If you want to make
changes to this user guide, you can use GitHub to edit it directly.

(Optional) If your SaaS account is part of an organizational account, you
might be asked to request organization access as part of authorizing
Quick Sight. If you want to do this, follow the prompts on your SaaS screen,
then choose to authorize Quick Sight. 7. After authorization is complete, choose a table or object to connect to. Then
choose **Select**. 8. On the **Finish data set creation** screen, choose one of
these options:

    * To save the data source and dataset, choose **Edit/Preview
     data**. Then choose **Save** from the top
     menu bar.
    * To create a dataset and an analysis using the data as-is, choose
     **Visualize**. This option automatically saves the
     data source and the dataset.


    You can also choose **Edit/Preview data** to prepare
     the data before creating an analysis. This opens the data preparation
     screen. For more information about data preparation, see [Preparing dataset examples](preparing-data-sets.md "preparing-data-sets.md").

The following constraints apply:

- The SaaS source must support REST API operations for Quick Sight to connect
  to it.
- If you are connecting to Jira, the URL must be public address.
- If you don't have enough [SPICE](spice.md "spice.md")
  capacity, choose **Edit/Preview data**. In the data preparation
  screen, you can remove fields from the dataset to decrease its size or apply a
  filter that reduces the number of rows returned. For more information about data
  preparation, see [Preparing dataset examples](preparing-data-sets.md "preparing-data-sets.md").
