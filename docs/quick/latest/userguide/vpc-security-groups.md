# Security groups: inbound and outbound

rules

A _security group_ acts as a virtual firewall for
your instance to control inbound and outbound traffic. For each security group, you add
rules that control the inbound traffic to instances, and a separate set of rules that
control the outbound traffic.

For your VPC connection, create a new security group with the description
`QuickSight-VPC`. This security group must allow all inbound TCP traffic
from the security groups of the data destinations that you want to reach. The following
example creates a new security group in the VPC and returns the ID of the new security
group.

```

aws ec2 create-security-group \
--group-name quicksight-vpc \
--description "QuickSight-VPC" \
--vpc-id `vpc-0daeb67adda59e0cd`

```

###### Important

Network configuration is sufficiently complex that we strongly recommend that you
create a new security group for use with Amazon Quick. It also makes it easier for
AWS Support to help you if you need to contact them. Creating a new group isn't
absolutely required. However, the following topics are based on the assumption that
you follow this recommendation.

To enable Quick to successfully connect to an instance in your VPC,
configure your security group rules to allow traffic between the Amazon Quick network
interface and the instance that contains your data. To do this, configure the security
group attached to your database's instance inbound rules to allow the following
traffic:

- From the port that Amazon Quick is connecting to
- From one of the following options:

      + The security group ID that's associated with Amazon Quick network
       interface (recommended)


      or
      + The private IP address of the Amazon Quick network interface

## Inbound rules

###### Important

The following section applies to your VPC connection if the connection was
created before April 27, 2023.

When you create a security group, it has no inbound rules. No inbound traffic
originating from another host to your instance is allowed until you add inbound
rules to the security group.

The security group attached to the Amazon Quick network interface behaves
differently than most security groups, because it isn't stateful. Other security
groups are usually _stateful_. This means that, after they
establish an outbound connection to a resource's security group, they automatically
allow return traffic. In contrast, the Amazon Quick network interface security group
doesn't automatically allow return traffic. Because of this, adding an egress rule
to the Amazon Quick network interface security group doesn't work. To make it work
for the Amazon Quick network interface security group, make sure to add an inbound
rule that explicitly authorizes the return traffic from the database host.

The inbound rule in your security group must allow traffic on all ports. It needs
to do this because the destination port number of any inbound return packets is set
to a randomly allocated port number.

To restrict Amazon Quick to connect only to certain instances, you can specify the
security group ID (recommended) or private IP address of the instances that you want
to allow. In either case, your security group inbound rule still needs to allow
traffic on all ports (0–65535).

To allow Amazon Quick to connect to any instance in the VPC, you can configure the
Amazon Quick network interface security group. In this case, give it an inbound rule
to allow traffic on 0.0.0.0/0 on all ports (0–65535). The security group used
by the Amazon Quick network interface should be different than the security groups
used for your databases. We recommend that you use separate security groups for VPC
connection.

###### Important

If you are using a long-standing Amazon RDS DB instance, check your configuration
to see if you're using a DB security group. DB security groups are used with DB
instances that are not in a VPC and are on the EC2-Classic platform.

If this is your configuration, and you aren't moving your DB instance into the
VPC for use with Amazon Quick, make sure to update your DB security group's
inbound rules. Update them to allow inbound traffic from the VPC security group
that you're using for Amazon Quick. For more information, see [Controlling Access with Security Groups](../../../AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Overview.md "../../../AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Overview.md") in the
_Amazon RDS User Guide._

## Outbound rules

###### Important

The following section applies to your VPC connection if the connection was
created before April 27, 2023.

By default, a security group includes an outbound rule that allows all outbound
traffic. We recommend that you remove this default rule and add outbound rules that
allow specific outbound traffic only.

###### Warning

Do not configure the security group on the Amazon Quick network interface with
an outbound rule to allow traffic on all ports. For information on key
considerations and recommendations for managing network egress traffic from
VPCs, see [Security best practices for your VPC](../../../vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-security-best-practices.md "../../../vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-security-best-practices.md") in the
_Amazon VPC User Guide._

The security group attached to Amazon Quick network interface should have outbound
rules that allow traffic to each of the database instances in your VPC that you want
Amazon Quick to connect to. To restrict Amazon Quick to connect only to certain
instances, specify the security group ID (recommended) or the private IP address of
the instances to allow. You set this up, along with the appropriate port numbers for
your instances (the port that the instances are listening on), in the outbound
rule.

The VPC security group must also allow outbound traffic to the security groups of
the data destinations, specifically on the port or ports that the database is
listening on.
