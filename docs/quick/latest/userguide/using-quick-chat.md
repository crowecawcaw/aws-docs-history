## Welcome message

When you log in, Amazon Quick chat displays a welcome message.

## Suggested prompts

To help you get started on interacting with your resources in chat, Amazon Quick
displays suggested prompts you can use to learn more about Amazon Quick features. Use
these to get started on your tasks. Once you select a prompt, Amazon Quick guides you
step-by-step through the information it needs from you to complete the task.

###### Note

Suggested prompts are system generated for the system agent; you can't customize
them. For custom agents, suggested prompts can be created and customized by the
agent builder or owner.

## Expand and collapse modes

To help enhance your productivity and streamline your chat interactions, Amazon Quick
offers two separate chat window display modes:

- **Collapse mode** – The default chat
  window display. Use for easy access to chat from within all Amazon Quick
  contexts.
- **Expand mode** – Access chat in an
  expanded view. Use this mode to work in the chat window without any
  distractions.

You can open up the chat interface at any time by selecting the chat bubble icon from
the top right navigation menu. You can also exit out of the chat at any time by
selecting the cancel icon from the top navigation menu.

## Agent picker

Chat agents in Amazon Quick are conversational assistants that help users explore
data, analyze information, and take actions. You can pick any agent you've created to
use during chat, or use the system agent **My Assistant** for your
conversations.

To learn more about agents, see [Working with agents](../../../quicksuite/latest/userguide/working-with-agents.md "../../../quicksuite/latest/userguide/working-with-agents.md").

## Scoping response generation to specific data

When you use Amazon Quick, you can define what data you want your chat responses
generated from using data filters. Data filters enable you to customize your chat's
expertise area. The data available to your agent depends on whether it is bound to
specific Amazon Quick knowledge and integrations, or if it's unbounded (not connected to
specific Amazon Quick resources).

By default, an agent has knowledge of all your Amazon Quick resources and its
underlying large language model (LLM). While using chat, you can select between the
following knowledge modes:

- **All data and apps** – Amazon Quick will
  use all available knowledge sources (including spaces, dashboards, datasets, topics,
  knowledge bases, action integrations, and LLM knowledge) to generate a response
  to your prompts.
- **General knowledge** – Amazon Quick will
  only use LLM knowledge to generate responses to your prompts. It won't use any
  knowlegde from Amazon Quick resources.
- **Specific data and apps** – Chat with a
  specific or multiple spaces, dashboards, datasets, topics, knowledge bases, or actions. To
  choose specific resources, select **Choose resource**.

An agent with pre-defined knowledge, on the other hand, only has knowledge of existing
Amazon Quick resources already linked to it, and its underlying LLM knowledge. While
chatting with an agent with pre-defined knowledge, you get the following knowledge
modes:

- **Pre-defined knowledge** – Amazon Quick
  will use only the Amazon Quick resource knowledge linked to the agent, and LLM
  knowledge, to generate responses. You can't change this setting.
- **Additional data and apps** – Chat with a
  specific or multiple spaces, dashboards, datasets, topics, or knowledge bases and actions.
  To choose specific resources, select **Choose
  resource**.

## Chatting with datasets

You can chat with your datasets in Amazon Quick to ask questions and get insights
from your data using natural language. To get started, you need to first create a
dataset. For more information, see [Creating
datasets](../../../quicksight/latest/user/creating-data-sets.md "../../../quicksight/latest/user/creating-data-sets.md").

Amazon Quick chat supports the following dataset types:

- SPICE datasets
- Direct Query datasets against Amazon Redshift, Athena, Aurora PostgreSQL, and Amazon S3
  Tables

###### Note

Direct Query datasets against other data sources are not yet supported for
chat.

For SPICE datasets, the size limit of 2 TB and 2 billion rows applies
when chatting with the dataset.

## Chatting with Topics

You can chat with your Topics in Amazon Quick to ask natural language questions that
span multiple datasets. When you select a Topic as your data context in chat,
the LLM-powered chat agent uses the defined relationships, dataset enrichment metadata,
and custom instructions to generate cross-dataset SQL queries and return unified
answers.

To chat with a Topic, use the data filter to select **Specific data and
apps** and choose your Topic from the list. Or navigate to the Topic and
choose the chat icon.

The chat agent traverses relationships across datasets, identifying which tables
contain the relevant columns, constructing SQL with appropriate joins, and returning
a unified answer. You can view the generated SQL in the Explanation panel to verify
the correct datasets and joins were used.

Amazon Quick chat supports the following Topic types:

- **New Topics (multi-dataset)** –
  The LLM-powered chat agent generates cross-dataset SQL with runtime joins.
  It can produce inner joins, left joins, outer joins, unions, and subqueries
  based on your defined relationships and custom instructions.
- **Legacy Topics** – The legacy ML-based
  fuzzy search model selects one dataset from the Topic and queries only that
  single dataset. Cross-dataset queries are not supported.

For more information about creating and configuring Topics, see [Working with Amazon Quick Sight Topics](topics.md "topics.md").

## Web search

Amazon Quick comes with built-in web search capability. Amazon Quick chat
automatically searches both your connected data sources and the web, providing
comprehensive answers from either or both sources as needed. You can turn web search off
for any query by clicking the globe icon in the chat panel. Any content retrieved from
the web is appropriately cited in the final response.

###### Note

Web search is available to users only if it has been enabled by admin.

## Upload files and chat

You can upload documents into Amazon Quick chat and ask Amazon Quick chat to summarize
or analyze data based on the content of the uploaded documents.

When you start a new conversation, you can upload new files, choose from a saved list
of recent documents, or drag and drop files directly into the conversation.

You can upload up to 20 files at one time with the following size limits:

- 10 MB for images (`.jpeg`, `.png`)
- 10 MB for spreadsheet files (`.csv`, `.xls`,
  `.xlsx`)
- 50 MB for other supported formats

Supported file types include:

- Word (`.docx`)
- Excel (`.xls`, `.xlsx`)
- PowerPoint (`.ppt`, `.pptx`)
- PDF (`.pdf`)
- images (`.jpeg`, `.png`)
- text files (`.csv`, `.txt`, `.rtf`,
  `.md`)
- Outlook (`.msg`)
- structured data files (`.json`, `.yaml`,
  `.xml`, `.vtt`, and common code files)

The total parsed content for all files combined has to be under 665,000
characters.

###### Note

If your files exceed the file count and character count limits, you can upload
them to a [space](../../../quicksuite/latest/userguide/working-with-spaces.md "../../../quicksuite/latest/userguide/working-with-spaces.md") instead.

Documents uploaded through the chat interface are deleted with the associated
conversation after 90 days of inactivity.

###### Note

Audio and video files are not supported as file uploads.

## Actions

Amazon Quick actions boost productivity by allowing you to perform relevant tasks in
supported third-party services from your Amazon Quick chat interface, like sending an
email using Microsoft Outlook, or creating a PagerDuty
incident. You can invoke any actions configured and available to you from your
Amazon Quick chat interface. To select an action, use the action application from the
data scoping filter and select the third party application you want to perform actions
in. Then, choose the action you want to perform from the available actions. The system
checks if you have authorization to perform the action before performing it.

To learn more about actions, see [Actions in Amazon Quick](../../../quicksuite/latest/userguide/action-integrations.md "../../../quicksuite/latest/userguide/action-integrations.md").

## Flows

Use Amazon Quick flows to create shortcuts for everyday, repetitive tasks you perform
while chatting in Amazon Quick. For example, if you find yourself using Amazon Quick
chat to create and copy edit product launch descriptions, you can use Amazon Quick flows
to generate an application that takes your draft content as input, and generates a
polished draft—after content, style, and grammar review—as output.

You can run a flow directly from chat within a conversation. Within a single
conversation, you can talk to a chat agent as well as run a flow.

To learn more about flows, see [Flows in Amazon Quick](../../../quicksuite/latest/userguide/using-amazon-quick-flows.md "../../../quicksuite/latest/userguide/using-amazon-quick-flows.md").

## Memory and response personalization

Memory in Amazon Quick chat helps personalize your conversations by remembering your preferences, context, and past interactions. Chat agents can reference this stored information to provide more personalized and contextually relevant responses without you needing to repeat information in every conversation, enabling more relevant and tailored responses over time.

When you interact with chat agents in Amazon Quick, you can provide your preferences including:

- Response style and format
- Frequently accessed Dashboards, Spaces, integrations, and other Amazon Quick assets
- Context about your role and responsibilities
- Common tasks and workflows you perform

This information is securely stored and fetched to enhance your future interactions with chat agents. Memories are specific to you and are not shared with other users. To get the most value from memory in chat, follow the best practices below:

- **Be explicit about your preferences** – Clearly state your preferences, priorities, and context when you want the chat agent to remember them. For example, "I prefer reports in table format" or "I work on the marketing team".
- **Provide relevant context** – Share information about your role, responsibilities, and common tasks to help chat agents understand your needs better.
- **Update your preferences** – As your priorities change, inform the chat agent about updates to ensure the stored information remains current and relevant.
- **Review and refine** – If responses don't align with your expectations, provide feedback and clarify your preferences to improve future interactions.

You maintain control over your memory data. You can review chat memory by going to **Conversation History** and clicking on **View Memories**.

###### Note

Chat memory has the following limitations:

- Chat memory isn't supported for accounts configured with [AWS KMS customer managed keys](../../../quicksuite/latest/userguide/customer-managed-keys.md "../../../quicksuite/latest/userguide/customer-managed-keys.md").

## Source citations

Amazon Quick chat responses provide in-text source citations in a numbered list. To
view the source for a response, choose the number at the end of the sentence. The dialog
box shows the title, URL, and a snippet from the source that was used to generate the
response. Choose the URL to view the source document.

To view the full list of sources, choose **Sources** at the end of
the response. You can use the source list to fact-check the response, or for deeper
analysis.

## Copy responses

You can copy and save the responses for later review and analysis. To copy a response,
choose the copy icon at the end of the response.

## Provide feedback

You can provide direct feedback about the responses you received from Amazon Quick
chat by using the thumbs-up or thumbs-down button. Your feedback is used to help address
technical issues in the web experience.

If you select the thumbs-down button, you can choose from the following feedback
options:

- **Inaccurate, not factually correct**
- **Incomplete answer**
- **Didn't understand my question**
- **Issue with sources**
- **Too wordy**
- **Offensive or unsafe language**
- **Other**

You can also copy conversation details from the feedback window for further
troubleshooting.

## Artifact panel

An _artifact_ in Amazon Quick is defined as any Amazon Quick
generated content produced using Amazon Quick's underlying large language model's (LLM)
generative capabilities, for example: contracts, email drafts, social media posts,
tables, interactive charts, code blocks, or any Amazon Quick visuals.

Amazon Quick stores any artifacts it generates as responses during chat in an artifact
panel. You can access any artifacts created during your chat by selecting **View
more** from below the artifact in chat.

You can download artifacts as text, CSV, code files, Word documents, Excel
spreadsheets, PowerPoint presentations, PDFs, and infographics. Saving artifacts to
a Space is not currently supported.

For more information about creating and downloading documents and visuals, see
[Document and visual creation with Amazon Quick](document-and-visual-creation.md "document-and-visual-creation.md").

## Conversation management

Amazon Quick stores conversations for up to 90 days, and you can access them in the
left navigation pane. You can perform the following tasks to manage your
conversations:

- **Start new conversation** – Choose
  **+** from the chat controls menu to start a new
  conversation.
- **View conversation history** – Choose the
  clock icon to view all conversation history for the last 90 days. You can filter
  conversation history to specific agents.

###### Note

Searching, saving, renaming, and sharing conversations with other users is not
supported.

## Response events

For every natural language prompt Amazon Quick chat receives, it generates real-time
processing steps while the request is being fulfilled. These steps can be viewed as part
of **Response events** during response generation, and are also
accessible once Amazon Quick has finished generating a response. Response events vary
based on the chat interaction you're having (whether you're chatting with a file you've
uploaded or with a Amazon Quick resource) and capture any rewrites to your response
before it's finalized. A response event also includes the system generated identifiers
for your conversation—you can copy and save the information for
troubleshooting..

## Explanations

When you chat with dashboards and datasets, each answer includes an Explanation
that shows how the model arrived at each numerical claim, including the data sources, assumptions, filters, calculations, and
SQL queries that the model used. Instead of manually verifying each answer by finding
the original source and re-creating the logic, you can directly see the model's
assumptions at the click of a button.

When you open an Explanation, you can see the following components:

- **Found data in** – Displays the
  dashboards, sheets, or datasets where the insight came from.
- **Filters** – Lists dashboard filter
  values that were used to arrive at the answer.
- **Assumptions** – Unpacks any large
  language model (LLM)-derived definitions from either the data directly or
  from world knowledge.
- **Calculation explained** – Shows any
  calculations that the model performed to arrive at the answer, presented in
  both natural language and as a math formula.
- **Generated SQL** (datasets only) –
  Displays the specific SQL query that produced each numerical claim.

For more information and examples, see
[Amazon Quick chat explanations](chat-explanations.md "chat-explanations.md").

## Contextual awareness

Amazon Quick chat is context aware. It registers the Amazon Quick resource you're
interacting with and scopes your chat automatically to the resource. This way, when you
start chatting, the resource you're interacting with is already included as a knowledge
source for your chat.

If you navigate to a specific Amazon Quick resource during an on-going chat, and that
resource supports chat, Amazon Quick chat will automatically register your new context
and ask you whether you want to chat with the specific resource you have navigated to.
If you want to continue chatting in the mode you're in, you can choose to
**Ignore** the message. Or you can choose **Yes**
to focus your chat on the specific resource you're interacting with. If you do so,
Amazon Quick automatically scopes your chat interactions to the resource in
context.

## Managing your preferences in Amazon Quick

User Preferences in Amazon Quick gives you control over how Quick looks,
feels, and works for you. You can customize your chat experience, set a default chat
agent, personalize how Quick interacts with you, and manage your memories
— all from a single settings modal.

### Customizing your chat experience

You can set your default chat panel to open in either expanded or collapsed mode.
By default, Quick automatically remembers your last used setting. For
example, if you expand the chat panel during a session, Quick updates
your default so the panel opens expanded the next time you return. You can also
manually set your preferred default at any time from the Preferences modal.

### Setting your default chat agent

You can choose a preferred chat agent that greets you each time you open
Quick. In addition to selecting a default agent, you can pre-select a
default knowledge scope for My Assistant. The available knowledge scope options
are:

- **All data and apps** –
  Quick searches across all your connected data sources and
  applications.
- **General knowledge** –
  Quick responds using general knowledge only, without searching
  your connected data.
- **Specific data and apps** –
  Quick searches only the data sources and applications you
  specify.

Your selected agent and knowledge scope are applied automatically each time you
start a new conversation.

### Personalizing your experience

You can let Quick know what to call you and share your area of focus
at work. Quick uses this context to personalize responses and make your
experience more relevant to your role and responsibilities.

### Managing your memories

You can view and manage your memories directly from Preferences. Memories are
insights that Quick learns from your conversations to personalize future
interactions. From the Memories section, you can:

- View all saved memories.
- Search for specific memories.
- Delete individual memories.
- Delete all memories at once.

### Accessing User Preferences

To access and configure your preferences:

1. Go to the top-right corner of the Amazon Quick homepage.
2. Choose your account name.
3. Select **Preferences** from the dropdown menu.
4. Make your changes across any of the available sections.
5. Choose **Save** to apply your changes, or choose
   **Cancel** to discard them.
