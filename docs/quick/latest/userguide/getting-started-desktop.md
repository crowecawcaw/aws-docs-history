## Downloading and installing

###### Important

If your organization uses a Professional or Enterprise account with IAM
Identity Center or IAM federation, complete the steps in [Setting up Amazon Quick on desktop for enterprise deployments](desktop-enterprise-setup.md "desktop-enterprise-setup.md") before downloading or distributing the
application. Enterprise sign-in is not available until an administrator configures
the extension access.

You can download the Amazon Quick desktop application from the following
locations:

  Amazon Quick on the web. In the left navigation, choose **Extensions**. On the **QuickDesktop-extension** card, choose the menu, and then choose
  **Download for Windows** or **Download for Mac**.
- **Direct download** – Use the following
  links:

| Platform              | Download                                                                                                                                                        |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| macOS (Apple Silicon) | [Amazon-Quick.dmg](https://desktop.downloads.quick.aws.com/mac/arm64/Amazon-Quick.dmg "https://desktop.downloads.quick.aws.com/mac/arm64/Amazon-Quick.dmg")     |

   folder or Launchpad.

###### Note

On first launch, macOS might display a security prompt stating that the

## Signing in

The sign-in process depends on your account type. Amazon Quick supports both Free
and Plus accounts and Professional and Enterprise accounts. When you open the
application, you see the **Sign in to your Quick
account** screen with two sign-in options.

###### To sign in with a Free or Plus account

1. Open the Amazon Quick desktop application.
2. On the sign-in screen, choose **Continue
   with** and select your preferred sign-in provider. Available
   providers include email, Amazon, Apple, Google, and GitHub.
3. You are redirected to the quick.aws.com sign-in page. Enter your account
   credentials for the provider you selected.
4. Complete any multi-factor authentication prompts.
5. After authentication succeeds, the application loads the Home
   screen.

###### Note

Enterprise sign-in must be configured by your organization's administrator
before you can use it. If your administrator has not yet completed the setup,
see [Setting up Amazon Quick on desktop for enterprise deployments](desktop-enterprise-setup.md "desktop-enterprise-setup.md").

###### To sign in with a Professional or Enterprise account

1. Open the Amazon Quick desktop application.
2. On the sign-in screen, choose **Enterprise
   login**.
3. You are redirected to your organization's identity provider. Enter your
   corporate credentials.
4. After authentication succeeds, the application loads the Home
   screen.

After you sign in, you can verify your authentication status in **Settings → Capabilities → Connections**. The **Authentication** section displays your signed-in account and
a green checkmark with the text "Signed in as `your-email`
(Social)" or your organization's identity type.

## Onboarding and setup

After you sign in for the first time, Amazon Quick guides you through an onboarding
flow to connect your data sources. Connecting your data sources allows
Quick to monitor what matters, prepare for meetings, and provide more
relevant responses.

The onboarding flow presents the following categories of connections:

| Category        | Description                                          | Examples                                  |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Email**       | Calendar and email for meeting prep and action items | Microsoft Outlook, Gmail, Google Calendar |
| **Messaging**   | Threads, DMs, and channels — triage what matters     | Slack, Microsoft Teams                    |
| **Local files** | Grant access to folders on your computer             | Any folder on your machine                |

For each category, you can choose **Connect** to set
up the connection immediately, or choose **Dismiss** to
skip it. Each connection opens a sign-in page where you authenticate with the
third-party service and grant Quick the required permissions.

###### Tip

You can skip the onboarding flow entirely and connect your data sources later.
To connect data sources at any time, open **Settings**
in the sidebar, choose **Capabilities**, and select
the **Connections** tab. Amazon Quick supports
connections including Slack, Microsoft Outlook, Microsoft Teams, Gmail,
Google Calendar, Google Drive, and more. For a complete list of available
connections, see [Connecting your data sources](connecting-data-sources-desktop.md "connecting-data-sources-desktop.md").

## After setup

After you complete the onboarding flow (or skip it), the Amazon Quick Home screen
displays:

- A **personalized greeting** based on the time
  of day.
- The **chat input area** where you can start
  asking questions or requesting tasks.
- **Connection setup cards** for any data sources
  you haven't connected yet. You can connect them at any time or dismiss
  them.
- A **priority feed widget** showing the most
  important items from your connected services, with suggested actions you can
  take directly.

You're now ready to start using Amazon Quick on desktop. For an overview of the
interface, see [Understanding the desktop interface](desktop-interface.md "desktop-interface.md"). To connect additional data
sources, see [Connecting your data sources](connecting-data-sources-desktop.md "connecting-data-sources-desktop.md").
