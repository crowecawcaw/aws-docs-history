In Amazon Quick Enterprise edition, you can embed Amazon Quick Sight dashboards, visuals, consoles,
and Q search bars in an app or web page. Domains that are going to host these embedded
assets must be on an _allow list_, the list of approved domains for your
Quick subscription. This requirement protects your data by preventing unapproved
domains from hosting embedded dashboards. To embed a Amazon Quick Sight dashboard, visual, console, or
Q search bar to a web page or app, add approved domains to a static allow list in the
Quick console. Alternatively, add them at runtime with the Quick
API.

Use the following sections to learn more about adding domains for embedded
analytics.

## Allow listing static domains

You can add static domains to your allow list through the Amazon Quick console. All
domains on your allow list (such as development, staging, and production) must be
explicitly allowed, and they must use HTTPS. You can add up to 100 domains to the allow
list.

To embed a dashboard to a static domain:

- Approve the hosting domains and subdomains for embedding.
- Publish the dashboard.
- Share the dashboard with users or groups so they can see the embedded version
  of it.

Use the following procedure to view or edit the list of approved domains.

###### To view or edit the list of approved domains

1. Choose the profile icon at top right.
2. Choose **Manage Amazon Quick**. You must be an Amazon Quick admin to
   access this screen.
3. Choose **Domains and Embedding** on the left. The domains
   that you can embed a dashboard in are listed at the bottom of the page.
4. (Optional) Add a new domain here by entering it in the
   **Domain** box. You can also choose **Include
   subdomains** to allow embedded dashboards on all subdomains. Choose
   **Add** to add the domain.

You can edit or delete existing domain by choosing the icons next to each
domain in the list at the bottom of the page.

Make sure that you use a valid HTTPS URL. The following list shows examples of URLs
that are valid for embedded dashboards that use a static domain:

- https://example-1.com
- https://www.アマゾンドメイン.jp
- https://www.亚马逊域名.cn:1234
- https://111.222.33.44:1234
- https://111.222.33.44
- http://localhost

The following list shows examples of URLs that are _not_ valid for
embedded dashboards:

- http://example
- https://example.com.\*.example-1.co.uk
- https://co.uk
- https://111.222.33.44.55:1234
- https://111.222.33.44.55

## Allow listing domains at runtime with

the Amazon Quick API

You can add a domain at runtime to an allow list with the `AllowedDomains`
parameter of a `GenerateEmbedUrlForAnonymousUser` or a
`GenerateEmbedUrlForRegisteredUser` API call. The
`AllowedDomains` parameter is an optional parameter. It grants you the
option as a developer to override the static domains that are configured in the
**Manage Amazon Quick** menu.

You can list up to three domains or subdomains. Adding domains to the allow list at
runtime also adds HTTP support for the domain `localhost`. The generated URL
is then embedded in a developer's website. Only the domains that are listed in the
parameter can access the embedded dashboard.

###### Security best practice for IAM condition operators

Improperly configured IAM condition operators can allow unauthorized access to your embedded Quick resources through URL variations. When using the `quicksight:AllowedEmbeddingDomains` condition key in your IAM policies, use condition operators that either allow specific domains or deny all domains that are not specifically allowed. For more information about IAM condition operators, see [IAM JSON policy elements: Condition operators](../../../IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_elements_condition_operators.md "../../../IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_elements_condition_operators.md") in the IAM User Guide.

Many different URL variations can point to the same resource. For example, the following URLs all resolve to the same content:

- `https://example.com`
- `https://example.com/`
- `https://Example.com`
  If your policy uses operators that do not account for these URL variations, an attacker can bypass your restrictions by providing equivalent URL variations.

You must validate that your IAM policy uses appropriate condition operators to prevent bypass vulnerabilities and ensure that only your intended domains can access your embedded resources.

To embed a dashboard to a domain at runtime, see [Embedding with the Amazon Quick APIs](../../../quicksight/latest/user/embedded-analytics-api.md "../../../quicksight/latest/user/embedded-analytics-api.md").

Make sure that you use a valid URL. The following list shows examples of URLs that are
valid for embedded dashboards that use a runtime domain:

- https://example-1.com
- http://localhost
- https://www.アマゾンドメイン.jp
- https://\*.sapp.amazon.com

The following list shows examples of URLs that are _not_ valid for
embedded dashboards:

- https://example.com.\*.example-1.co.uk
- https://co.uk
- https://111.222.33.44.55:1234
- https://111.222.33.44.55
