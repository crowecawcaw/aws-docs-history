# Searching for specific values in your data in

Quick Sight

When filtering your visual data, previewing anomalies, or using list or
dropdown controls in a dashboard, you can quickly search for values that
interest you.

You can search for specific values or all values that contain a specific
search query. For example, searching for _al_
in a list of U.S. states returns **Al**abama,
**Al**aska, and C**al**ifornia.

You can also use wildcard search to search for all values that match a
specific character pattern. For example, you can search for all U.S. states that
end with the letters _ia_ and narrow the
results down to California, Georgia, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and West
Virginia.

**To search for values in a filter or control**,
enter a search query in the search bar.

## Using wildcard search

The following wildcard characters can be used to find values in
Quick Sight filters, list and dropdown controls, and anomaly
previews.

- **\*** - Use an asterisk symbol to
  search for values that match zero to many characters in a specific
  position.
- **?** - Use a question mark to match
  a single character in a specific position.
- **\*\* - Use a backslash to escape the
  **\***, **?**, or **\*\* wildcard
  characters and search for them in your query. For example, you can
  search for phrases that end with a question mark.

Following are examples of how supported wildcard characters can be used in
a Quick Sight search query.

- `al` - This query searches for all values
  with `al` and returns Alabama, Alaska, and
  California.
- `al*` - This query searches for all values
  that begin with `al` and end with zero to
  multiple characters. It returns Alabama, and Alaska in a list of
  U.S. states.
- `*ia` - This query searches for all values
  that begin with zero to multiple characters and end with letters
  `ia`. It returns California, Georgia,
  Pennsylvania, Virginia, and West Virginia.
- `*al*` - This query searches for all values
  with zero to multiple characters before and after the letters
  `al`. It returns Alabama, Alaska, and
  California.
- `a?a?a?a` - This query searches for all
  values with a single character in the exact positions between the
  `a` letters. It returns Alabama.
- `a?a*a` - This query searches for all values
  with a single character between the first two
  `a` letters and multiple characters between
  the second two `a` letters. It returns Alabama
  and Alaska.
- `How*\?` - This query searches for values
  that begin with `How`, followed by zero to
  multiple characters, and end with a question mark. The backslash (\)
  in this query informs Quick Sight to search for question marks in
  each value, rather than use the question mark symbol as a wildcard
  character. This query returns the questions, How are you? and, How
  is this possible?
- `\**` - This query searches for values that
  begin with an asterisk and are followed by zero to multiple
  characters. The backslash (\) in this query informs Quick Sight to
  search for an actual asterisk in the values, rather than use the
  asterisk symbol as a wildcard character. This query returns values
  such as \*all, \*above, and \*below.
- `\\*` - This query searches for values with a
  backslash, followed by zero to multiple characters. The first
  backslash (\) in this query informs Quick Sight to search for the
  second backslash (\) in each value, rather than use the backslash
  symbol as a wildcard character. This query returns results such as
  \Home.
- `???` - This query searches for values that
  contain three characters. It returns values such as ant, bug, and
  car.
