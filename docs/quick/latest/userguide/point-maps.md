<a name="point-maps"></a>

You can create point maps in Quick to show the difference between data values for each location by size. Each point on this type of map corresponds to a geographic location in your data, such as a country, state or province, or city. The size of the points on the map represents the magnitude of the field in the **Size** field well, in relation to other values in the same field. The color of the points represents the values in the **Color** field well. The field values in the **Color** field well display in the legend, if you choose a field for color.

Use the following procedure to create a point map in Quick.

To create point maps in Quick, make sure that you have the following:
+ One geospatial field (such as country, state or region, county or district, city, or ZIP code or postal code). Or you can use one latitude field and one longitude field.
+ One numeric field (measure) for size.
+ (Optional) A categorical field (dimension) for color.

For information on formatting geospatial maps, see [Map and geospatial chart formatting options](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/quicksight/latest/user/geospatial-formatting).

## Creating point maps

**To create a point map**

1. Add a new visual to your analysis. For more information about starting analyses, see [Starting an analysis in Quick Sight](creating-an-analysis.md). For more information about adding visuals to analyses, see [Adding a visual](creating-a-visual.md#create-a-visual).

1. For **Visual type**, choose the **Points on map** icon. It looks like a globe with a point on it.

1. Drag a geographic field from the **Fields list** pane to the **Geospatial** field well, for example `Country`. You can also choose a latitude or longitude field.

   A point map appears with a point for each location in your data.

   If the field is part of a geographic hierarchy, the hierarchy displays in the field well.

1. Drag a measure from the **Fields list** pane to the **Size** field well.

   The points on the map update to show the magnitude of values for each location. 

1. (Optional) Drag a dimension from the **Fields list** pane to the **Color** field well.

   Each point updates to show a point for each categorical value in the dimension.
