Before you use IAM to manage access to Amazon Quick, you should understand what IAM features are available to use with Amazon Quick. To get a high-level view of how Amazon Quick and other AWS services work with IAM, see [AWS Services That Work with IAM](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_aws-services-that-work-with-iam.html) in the *IAM User Guide*.

## Amazon Quick Policies (identity-based)
<a name="security_iam_service-with-iam-id-based-policies"></a>

With IAM identity-based policies, you can specify allowed or denied actions and resources as well as the conditions under which actions are allowed or denied. Amazon Quick supports specific actions, resources, and condition keys. To learn about all of the elements that you use in a JSON policy, see [IAM JSON Policy Elements Reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_elements.html) in the *IAM User Guide*.

You can use AWS root credentials or IAM user credentials to create an Amazon Quick account. AWS root and administrator credentials already have all of the required permissions for managing Amazon Quick access to AWS resources. 

However, we recommend that you protect your root credentials, and instead use IAM user credentials. To do this, you can create a policy and attach it to the IAM user and roles that you plan to use for Amazon Quick. The policy must include the appropriate statements for the Amazon Quick administrative tasks you need to perform, as described in the following sections.

**Important**  
Be aware of the following when working with Quick and IAM policies:  
Avoid directly modifying a policy that was created by Quick. When you modify it yourself, Quick can't edit it. This inability can cause an issue with the policy. To fix this issue, delete the previously modified policy. 
If you get an error on permissions when you try to create an Amazon Quick account, see [Actions Defined by Amazon Quick](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/service-authorization/latest/reference/list_amazonquicksight.html#amazonquicksight-actions-as-permissions) in the *IAM User Guide*. 
In some cases, you might have an Amazon Quick account that you can't access even from the root account (for example, if you accidentally deleted its directory service). In this case, you can delete your old Amazon Quick account, then recreate it. For more information, see [Deleting your Amazon Quick subscription and closing the account](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/quicksight/latest/user/closing-account.html).

### Actions
<a name="security_iam_service-with-iam-id-based-policies-actions"></a>

Administrators can use AWS JSON policies to specify who has access to what. That is, which **principal** can perform **actions** on what **resources**, and under what **conditions**.

The `Action` element of a JSON policy describes the actions that you can use to allow or deny access in a policy. Include actions in a policy to grant permissions to perform the associated operation.

Policy actions in Amazon Quick use the following prefix before the action: `quicksight:`. For example, to grant someone permission to run an Amazon EC2 instance with the Amazon EC2 `RunInstances` API operation, you include the `ec2:RunInstances` action in their policy. Policy statements must include either an `Action` or `NotAction` element. Amazon Quick defines its own set of actions that describe tasks that you can perform with this service.

To specify multiple actions in a single statement, separate them with commas as follows:

```
"Action": [
	      "quicksight:action1",
	      "quicksight:action2"]
```

You can specify multiple actions using wildcards (\*). For example, to specify all actions that begin with the word `Create`, include the following action:

```
"Action": "quicksight:Create*"
```



Amazon Quick provides a number of AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) actions. All Amazon Quick actions are prefixed with `quicksight:`, such as `quicksight:Subscribe`. For information about using Amazon Quick actions in an IAM policy, see [IAM policy examples for Amazon Quick](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/quicksight/latest/user/iam-policy-examples.html).

To see the most up-to-date list of Amazon Quick actions, see [Actions Defined by Amazon Quick](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/service-authorization/latest/reference/list_amazonquicksight.html#amazonquicksight-actions-as-permissions) in the *IAM User Guide*. 

### Resources
<a name="security_iam_service-with-iam-id-based-policies-resources"></a>

Administrators can use AWS JSON policies to specify who has access to what. That is, which **principal** can perform **actions** on what **resources**, and under what **conditions**.

The `Resource` JSON policy element specifies the object or objects to which the action applies. As a best practice, specify a resource using its [Amazon Resource Name (ARN)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference-arns.html). For actions that don't support resource-level permissions, use a wildcard (\*) to indicate that the statement applies to all resources.

```
"Resource": "*"
```



Following is an example policy. It means that the caller with this policy attached, is able to invoke the `CreateGroupMembership` operation on any group, provided that the user name they are adding to the group is not `user1`. 

```
{
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Action": "quicksight:CreateGroupMembership",
    "Resource": "arn:aws:quicksight:us-east-1:{{aws-account-id}}:group/default/*",
    "Condition": {
        "StringNotEquals": {
            "quicksight:UserName": "user1"
        }
    }
}
```

Some Amazon Quick actions, such as those for creating resources, cannot be performed on a specific resource. In those cases, you must use the wildcard (\*).

```
"Resource": "*"
```

Some API actions involve multiple resources. To specify multiple resources in a single statement, separate the ARNs with commas. 

```
"Resource": [
	      "resource1",
	      "resource2"
```

To see a list of Amazon Quick resource types and their Amazon Resource Names (ARNs), see [Resources Defined by Amazon Quick](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/service-authorization/latest/reference/list_amazonquicksight.html#amazonquicksight-resources-for-iam-policies) in the *IAM User Guide*. To learn with which actions you can specify the ARN of each resource, see [Actions Defined by Amazon Quick](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/service-authorization/latest/reference/list_amazonquicksight.html#amazonquicksight-actions-as-permissions).

### Condition keys
<a name="security_iam_service-with-iam-id-based-policies-conditionkeys"></a>

Administrators can use AWS JSON policies to specify who has access to what. That is, which **principal** can perform **actions** on what **resources**, and under what **conditions**.

The `Condition` element specifies when statements execute based on defined criteria. You can create conditional expressions that use [condition operators](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_elements_condition_operators.html), such as equals or less than, to match the condition in the policy with values in the request. To see all AWS global condition keys, see [AWS global condition context keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_condition-keys.html) in the *IAM User Guide*.

Amazon Quick does not provide any service-specific condition keys, but it does support using some global condition keys. To see all AWS global condition keys, see [AWS Global Condition Context Keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_condition-keys.html) in the *IAM User Guide*.

### Examples

To view examples of Amazon Quick identity-based policies, see [Amazon Quick Policies (identity-based)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/quicksight/latest/user/security_iam_service-with-iam-id-based-policies.html).

## Amazon Quick policies (resource-based)
<a name="security_iam_service-with-iam-resource-based-policies"></a>

Amazon Quick doesn't support resource-based policies. However, you can use the Amazon Quick console to configure access to other AWS resources in your AWS account.

## Authorization based on Amazon Quick tags
<a name="security_iam_service-with-iam-tags"></a>

Amazon Quick does not support tagging resources or controlling access based on tags.

## Amazon Quick IAM roles
<a name="security_iam_service-with-iam-roles"></a>

An [IAM role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles.html) is an entity within your AWS account that has specific permissions. You can use IAM roles to group permissions together to make it easier to manage user's access to Amazon Quick actions. 

Amazon Quick doesn't support the following role features:
+ Service-linked roles.
+ Service roles.
+ Temporary credentials (direct use): However, Amazon Quick uses temporary credentials to allow users to assume an IAM role to access embedded dashboards. For more information, see [Embedded analytics for Amazon Quick](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/quicksight/latest/user/embedded-analytics.html).

For more information on how Amazon Quick uses IAM roles, see [Using Amazon Quick with IAM](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/quicksight/latest/user/security_iam_service-with-iam.html) and [IAM policy examples for Amazon Quick](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/quicksight/latest/user/iam-policy-examples.html).
