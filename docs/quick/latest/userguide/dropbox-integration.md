# Dropbox integration
<a name="dropbox-integration"></a>

With the Dropbox connector, you can access the Dropbox platform directly in Amazon Quick through natural language. You can upload files, manage folder structures, generate sharing links, and search for content without leaving Amazon Quick.

Amazon Quick supports multiple authentication methods for Dropbox. Choose the method that best fits your organization's security requirements.
+ **Default OAuth app** – Uses an AWS-managed OAuth application. No additional credentials are needed. You authenticate directly with your Dropbox account.
+ **Custom OAuth app** – Uses a customer-managed OAuth application that is registered in Dropbox. This option gives your organization full control over the OAuth configuration.
+ **API Key** – Uses a Dropbox access token for authentication. This method is suitable for individual use or testing.

For more information about the authentication methods that Amazon Quick supports, see [Authentication methods](quick-action-auth.md).

## Before you begin
<a name="dropbox-integration-prerequisites"></a>

Make sure that you have the following before you set up the integration.
+ An active Dropbox account with access to the files and folders that you want to use.
+ For **Custom OAuth app**: Access to the [Dropbox App Console](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/apps) on the Dropbox website to create an app.
+ For **API Key**: An access token that is generated from the [Dropbox App Console](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/apps) on the Dropbox website.
+ For Amazon Quick subscription requirements, see [Set up integrations in the console](integration-console-setup-process.md).

## Configuring Dropbox

If you are using **Default OAuth app** authentication, skip this section and go to [Setting up the connector in Amazon Quick](#dropbox-quicksuite-setup).

For Custom OAuth app or API Key authentication, complete the applicable steps in Dropbox before you configure Amazon Quick.

### Create a Dropbox app for Custom OAuth app

## Managing and troubleshooting
<a name="dropbox-integration-troubleshooting"></a>

To edit, share, or delete your connector, see [Managing existing integrations](integration-workflows.md#managing-existing-integrations).

### Authentication issues
<a name="dropbox-troubleshooting-auth"></a>
+ **Sign-in fails (Default OAuth app or Custom OAuth app)** – Verify that your Dropbox account is active and that you can sign in to [the Dropbox website](https://www.dropbox.com) directly. For Custom OAuth app, confirm that the redirect URL in your Dropbox app matches the Amazon Quick callback URL.
+ **Invalid client credentials (Custom OAuth app)** – Verify that the Client ID and Client secret match the app key and app secret values in your Dropbox app. If you regenerated the app secret, update the value in Amazon Quick.
+ **API Key rejected** – Verify that your access token is active. Tokens can expire or be revoked in the Dropbox App Console.
+ **Insufficient permissions** – Verify that your Dropbox app has the required permission scopes for the actions that you want to use.
