# Creating a dataset using an existing

dataset in Amazon Quick

After you create a dataset in Amazon Quick, you can create additional datasets using it as a
source. When you do this, any data preparation that the parent dataset contains, such as
any joins or calculated fields, is kept. You can add additional preparation to the data
in the new child datasets, such as joining new data and filtering data. You can also set
up your own data refresh schedule for the child dataset and track the dashboards and
analyses that use it.

Child datasets that are created using a dataset with RLS rules active as a source
inherit the parent dataset's RLS rules. Users who are creating a child dataset from a
larger parent dataset can only see the data that they have access to in the parent
dataset. Then, you can add more RLS rules to the new child dataset in addition to the
inherited RLS rules to further manage who can access the data that is in the new
dataset. You can only create child datasets from datasets with RLS rules active in
Direct Query.

Creating datasets from existing Quick datasets has the following
advantages:

- **Central management of datasets** – Data
  engineers can easily scale to the needs of multiple teams within their
  organization. To do this, they can develop and maintain a few general-purpose
  datasets that describe the organization's main data models.
- **Reduction of data source management** –
  Business analysts (BAs) often spend lots of time and effort requesting access to
  databases, managing database credentials, finding the right tables, and managing
  Quick data refresh schedules. Building new datasets from existing datasets
  means that BAs don't have to start from scratch with raw data from
  databases. They can start with curated data.
- **Predefined key metrics** – By creating
  datasets from existing datasets, data engineers can centrally define and
  maintain critical data definitions across their company's many
  organizations. Examples might be sales growth and net marginal return. With this
  feature, data engineers can also distribute changes to those definitions. This
  approach means that their business analysts can get started with visualizing the
  right data more quickly and reliably.
- **Flexibility to customize data** – By
  creating datasets from existing datasets, business analysts get more flexibility
  to customize datasets for their own business needs. They can avoid worry about
  disrupting data for other teams.
  For example, let's say that you're part of an ecommerce central team of five
  data engineers. You and your team has access to sales, orders, cancellations, and
  returns data in a database. You have created a Quick dataset by joining 18 other
  dimension tables through a schema. A key metric that your team has created is the
  calculated field, order product sales (OPS). Its definition is: OPS = product quantity x
  price.

Your team serves over 100 business analysts across 10 different teams in eight
countries. These are the Coupons team, the Outbound Marketing team, the Mobile Platform
team, and the Recommendations team. All of these teams use the OPS metric as a base to
analyze their own business line.

Rather than manually creating and maintaining hundreds of unconnected datasets, your
team reuses datasets to create multiple levels of datasets for teams across the
organization. Doing this centralizes data management and allows each team to customize
the data for their own needs. At the same time, this syncs updates to the data, such as
updates to metric definitions, and maintains row-level and column-level security. For
example, individual teams in your organization can use the centralized datasets. They
can then combine them with the data specific to their team to create new datasets and
build analyses on top of them.

Along with using the key OPS metric, other teams in your organization can reuse column
metadata from the centralized datasets that you created. For example, the Data
Engineering team can define metadata, such as _name_,
_description_, _data type_, and
_folders_, in a centralized dataset. All subsequent teams can use
it.

###### Note

Amazon Quick supports creating up to two additional levels of datasets from a single
dataset.

For example, from a parent dataset, you can create a child dataset and then a
grandchild dataset for a total of three dataset levels.

## Creating a dataset from

an existing dataset

Use the following procedure to create a dataset from an existing dataset.

###### To create a dataset from an existing dataset

1. From the Quick start page, choose **Data** in the
   pane at left.
2. Choose **Create** then choose the dataset that you want
   to use to create a new dataset.
3. On the page that opens for that dataset, choose the drop-down menu for
   **Use in analysis**, and then choose **Use in
   dataset**.

The data preparation page opens and preloads everything from the parent
dataset, including calculated fields, joins, and security settings. 4. On the data preparation page that opens, for **Query
mode** at bottom left, choose how you want the dataset to pull
in changes and updates from the original, parent dataset. You can choose the
following options:

    * **Direct query** – This is the default
     query mode. If you choose this option, the data for this dataset
     automatically refreshes when you open an associated dataset,
     analysis, or dashboard. However, the following limitations
     apply:




    	+ If the parent dataset allows direct querying, you can use
    	 direct query mode in the child dataset.
    	+ If you have multiple parent datasets in a join, you can
    	 choose direct query mode for your child dataset only if all
    	 the parents are from the same underlying data source. For
    	 example, the same Amazon Redshift connection.
    	+ Direct query is supported for a single
    	 SPICE parent dataset. It is not supported
    	 for multiple SPICE parent datasets in a
    	 join.
    * **SPICE** – If you choose
     this option, you can set up a schedule for your new dataset to sync
     with the parent dataset. For more information about creating
     SPICE refresh schedules for datasets, see [Refreshing SPICE data](refreshing-imported-data.md "refreshing-imported-data.md").

5. (Optional) Prepare your data for analysis. For more information about
   preparing data, see [Preparing data in Amazon Quick Sight](preparing-data.md "preparing-data.md").
6. (Optional) Set up row-level or column-level security (RLS/CLS) to restrict
   access to the dataset. For more information about setting up RLS, see [Using row-level
   security with user-based rules to restrict access to a dataset](restrict-access-to-a-data-set-using-row-level-security.md "restrict-access-to-a-data-set-using-row-level-security.md"). For more information about setting up CLS, see [Using
   column-level security to restrict access to a dataset](restrict-access-to-a-data-set-using-column-level-security.md "restrict-access-to-a-data-set-using-column-level-security.md").

###### Note

You can set up RLS/CLS on child datasets only. RLS/CLS on parent
datasets is not supported. 7. When you're finished, choose **Save & publish** to save your changes and publish the new child dataset. Or choose
**Publish & visualize** to publish the new child
dataset and begin visualizing your data.
