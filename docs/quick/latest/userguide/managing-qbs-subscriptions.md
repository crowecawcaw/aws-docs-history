# Configure Amazon Quick

subscriptions

You can purchase standard user subscriptions to get discounted pricing on Amazon Quick.
When you invite additional users to Quick, you're charged for those
accounts on a month-by-month basis. If you have Enterprise edition, you have the option to
take advantage of pay-per-session pricing for reader accounts. These are users who only view
data dashboards, and don't need author or admin access.

To understand how Amazon Quick subscription names on the pricing page map to user roles in
the admin console, see [Understanding Amazon Quick subscriptions and roles](../../../quicksuite/latest/userguide/user-types.md "../../../quicksuite/latest/userguide/user-types.md").

When you purchase an annual subscription, you pay for a Quick user account on
an annual rather than monthly basis. With an annual subscription, you receive a discounted
price in return for the extended time commitment. You don't need to purchase an annual
subscription to create or add users.

When you purchase a set of standard user subscriptions, you choose the number of accounts
you want to cover. You also choose when to start the subscriptions (any time from the month
following the current month, to one year in the future) and whether to autorenew them. All
subscriptions that you purchase together must use the same values for these settings.

You can edit an existing set of user subscriptions to change whether it autorenews. If the
set is not yet active, you can also change the number of subscriptions it covers, or delete
it entirely.

To see a full comparison of Standard edition with Enterprise edition, see [Amazon Quick
editions](https://aws.amazon.com/quicksight/resource-library/editions/ "https://aws.amazon.com/quicksight/resource-library/editions/").

When you upgrade your account, your administrators and authors are billed at the Amazon Quick
Enterprise edition rates. For pay-per-session
pricing, you can add additional users as readers. Before you reprovision existing users
as readers, you transfer or delete their resources, and then delete the users from your
subscription.

Users who are in the reader role can view and manipulate shared dashboards, and
receive emailed updates. However, readers can't add or change data sources, datasets,
analyses, visuals, or administrative settings. Billing for readers is significantly
lower in cost than regular user pricing. It's based on 30-minute sessions, and it's
capped at a maximum amount per month for each reader. Billing for upgrades is prorated
for the month of the upgrade. Upgrades to users are also prorated. If you have an annual
subscription to Standard edition, it's converted to Enterprise edition and stays in
place for the remaining term.

###### Warning

Downgrading from Enterprise edition to Standard edition isn't currently possible
due to the enhanced feature set available in Enterprise edition. To perform this
downgrade, unsubscribe from Amazon Quick, and then start a new subscription. Also, you
can't transfer users or assets between subscriptions.

Upgrading to Enterprise edition to use Active Directory connectivity isn't
supported. This is because of the differences in the user identity mechanisms
between Amazon Quick password-based users and existing Active Directory users.

However, you can upgrade to Enterprise and still use password-based users. If you
want to upgrade and change how users sign in, you can unsubscribe and start a new
subscription.

Use the following procedure to upgrade to Enterprise edition. To perform the upgrade,
you need administrative access to Amazon Quick, with security permissions to subscribe. The
person performing the upgrade is usually an AWS administrator who is also an Amazon Quick
administrator.

###### To upgrade to enterprise edition

1. Open the administrative settings page by clicking on your profile icon at top
   right.
2. At top left, choose **Upgrade now**.
3. Be sure that you want to upgrade.

###### Important

You can't undo this action.

Choose **Upgrade** to upgrade. The upgrade is
instantaneous.

Billing for the upgrade to your subscription is prorated for the month of
upgrade. Upgrades to Amazon Quick users are also prorated. 4. (Optional) Downgrade users to readers:

    * Before you start, make sure to transfer any assets your users own that
     you want to keep.
    * Delete the users and add them back to your subscription as readers.


    If you're using Active Directory, delete the authors, move them
     to the new reader group, then recreate them as readers in Amazon Quick.

When you upgrade to Enterprise edition, your admin and author users retain
their roles.
