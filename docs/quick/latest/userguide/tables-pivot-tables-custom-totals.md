# Custom total values

Quick authors can define the total and subtotal aggregations for their
table or pivot table visuals from the field wells. For tables,the custom total menu
is only available if totals are toggled on for the visual.

###### To change the aggregation of a total or subtotal

1.  Navigate to the analysis that you want to change, and choose the table or
    pivot table visual whose total you want to define.
2.  Choose the field that you want to change from the field wells.
3.  Choose **Total**, and then choose the aggregation that
    you want. The following options are available.

        * **Default** – The total
         calculation uses the same aggregation as the metric field.
        * **Sum** – Calculates the sum
         of the data in the visual.
        * **Average** – Calculates the
         average of the data in the visual.
        * **Min** – Calculates the
         minimum value of the data in the visual.
        * **Max** – Calculates the
         maximum value of the data in the visual.
        * **None (HIDE)** – Totals are
         not calculated. When you choose this option, the total and subtotal
         cells in the visual are left blank. If the outer dimension is sorted
         with the metric field that calculates the total or subtotal, the
         dimension is sorted alphabetically. When you change the value from
         **None (HIDE)** to another value, the outer
         dimension is sorted by the subtotals that are calculated with the
         specified aggregation type.

    The following limitations apply to custom totals.

- Conditional formatting is not supported for custom totals.
- Total aggregations aren't supported for string columns. Total aggregations
  include **Min**, **Max**,
  **Sum**, and **Average**.
- Date columns are incompatible with **Average** and
  **Sum** total aggregation functions.
