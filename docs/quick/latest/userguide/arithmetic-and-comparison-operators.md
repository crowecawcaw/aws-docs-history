# Operators

You can use the following operators in calculated fields. Quick uses the
standard order of operations: parentheses, exponents, multiplication, division,
addition, subtraction (PEMDAS). Equal (=) and not equal (<>) comparisons
are case-sensitive.

- Addition (+)
- Subtraction (−)
- Multiplication (\*)
- Division (/)
- Modulo (%) – See also `mod()` in the following list.
- Power (^) – See also `exp()` in the following list.
- Equal (=)
- Not equal (<>)
- Greater than (>)
- Greater than or equal to (>=)
- Less than (<)
- Less than or equal to (<=)
- AND
- OR
- NOT
  Amazon Quick supports applying the following mathematical functions to an
  expression.

- `Mod(`number`,
`divisor`)` – Finds the remainder
  after dividing a number by a divisor.
- `Log(`expression`)` – Returns the base 10 logarithm of a given expression.
- `Ln(`expression`)` – Returns the natural logarithm of a given expression.
- `Abs(`expression`)` – Returns the absolute value of a given expression.
- `Sqrt(`expression`)` – Returns the square root of a given expression.
- `Exp(`expression`)` – Returns the base of natural log _e_ raised to the power of a given expression.
  To make lengthy calculations easier to read, you can use parenthesis to clarify
  groupings and precedence in calculations. In the following statement, you don't need
  parentheses. The multiplication statement is processed first, and then the result is
  added to five, returning a value of 26. However, parentheses make the statement easier
  to read and thus maintain.

```
5 + (7 * 3)
```

Because parenthesis are first in the order of operations, you can change the order in
which other operators are applied. For example, in the following statement the addition
statement is processed first, and then the result is multiplied by three, returning a
value of 36.

```
(5 + 7) * 3
```

## Example: Arithmetic

operators

The following example uses multiple arithmetic operators to determine a sales
total after discount.

```
(Quantity * Amount) - Discount
```

## Example: (/) Division

The following example uses division to divide 3 by 2. A value of 1.5 is returned.
Amazon Quick uses floating point divisions.

```
3/2
```

## Example: (=) equal

Using = performs a case-sensitive comparison of values. Rows where the
comparison is TRUE are included in the result set.

In the following example, rows where the `Region` field is
`South` are included in the results. If the
`Region` is `south`, these rows are
excluded.

```
Region = 'South'
```

In the following example, the comparison evaluates to FALSE.

```
Region = 'south'
```

The following example shows a comparison that converts `Region` to
all uppercase (`SOUTH`), and compares it to
`SOUTH`. This returns rows where the region is
`south`, `South`, or
`SOUTH`.

```
toUpper(Region) = 'SOUTH'
```

## Example: (<>)

The not equal symbol <> means _less than or
greater than_.

So, if we say `x<>1`, then we are saying _if x is less than 1 OR if x is greater than 1_. Both
< and > are evaluated together. In other words, _if x
is any value except 1_. Or, _x is not equal to
1_.

###### Note

Use <>, not !=.

The following example compares `Status Code` to a numeric value. This
returns rows where the `Status Code` is not equal to
`1`.

```
statusCode <> 1
```

The following example compares multiple `statusCode` values. In this
case, active records have `activeFlag = 1`. This example returns rows
where one of the following applies:

- For active records, show rows where the status isn't 1 or 2
- For inactive records, show rows where the status is 99 or -1

```
( activeFlag = 1 AND (statusCode <> 1 AND statusCode <> 2) )
OR
( activeFlag = 0 AND (statusCode= 99 OR statusCode= -1) )
```

## Example: (^)

The power symbol `^` means _to the power
of_. You can use the power operator with any numeric field, with any
valid exponent.

The following example is a simple expression of 2 to the power of 4 or (2 \* 2 \* 2 \* 2). This returns a value of 16.

```
2^4
```

The following example computes the square root of the revenue field.

```
revenue^0.5
```

## Example: AND, OR, and NOT

The following example uses AND, OR, and NOT to compare multiple expressions. It
does so using conditional operators to tag top customers NOT in Washington or Oregon
with a special promotion, who made more than 10 orders. If no values are returned,
the value 'n/a' is used.

```
ifelse(( (NOT (State = 'WA' OR State = 'OR')) AND Orders > 10), 'Special Promotion XYZ', 'n/a')
```

## Example: Creating comparison lists

like "in" or "not in"

This example uses operators to create a comparison to find values that exist, or
don't exist, in a specified list of values.

The following example compares `promoCode` a specified list of values.
This example returns rows where the `promoCode` is in the list
`(1, 2, 3)`.

```
promoCode    = 1
OR promoCode = 2
OR promoCode = 3
```

The following example compares `promoCode` a specified list of values.
This example returns rows where the `promoCode` is NOT in the list
`(1, 2, 3)`.

```
NOT(promoCode = 1
OR promoCode  = 2
OR promoCode  = 3
)
```

Another way to express this is to provide a list where the `promoCode`
is not equal to any items in the list.

```
promoCode     <> 1
AND promoCode <> 2
AND promoCode <> 3
```

## Example: Creating a "between"

comparison

This example uses comparison operators to create a comparison showing values that
exist between one value and another.

The following example examines `OrderDate` and returns rows where the
`OrderDate` is between the first day and last day of 2016. In this
case, we want the first and last day included, so we use "or equal to" on the
comparison operators.

```
OrderDate >= "1/1/2016" AND OrderDate <= "12/31/2016"
```
