# distinctCountOver

The `distinctCountOver` function calculates the distinct count of the
operand partitioned by the specified attributes at a specified level. Supported levels
are `PRE_FILTER` and `PRE_AGG`. The operand must be
unaggregated.

## Syntax

The brackets are required. To see which arguments are optional, see the following
descriptions.

```
distinctCountOver
(
  `measure or dimension field`
  ,`[ partition_field, ... ]`
  ,`calculation level`
)
```

## Arguments

_measure or dimension field_

The measure or dimension that you want to do the calculation for, for
example `{Sales Amt}`. Valid values are
`PRE_FILTER` and `PRE_AGG`.

_partition field_

(Optional) One or more dimensions that you want to partition by,
separated by commas.

Each field in the list is enclosed in {} (curly braces), if it is more
than one word. The entire list is enclosed in [ ] (square
brackets).

_calculation level_

(Optional) Specifies the calculation level to use:

- `PRE_FILTER`
  – Prefilter calculations are computed before the dataset
  filters.
- `PRE_AGG` –
  Preaggregate calculations are computed before applying
  aggregations and top and bottom _N_ filters to the visuals.

This value defaults to `POST_AGG_FILTER` when blank.
`POST_AGG_FILTER` is not a valid level for this operation
and will result in an error message. For more information, see [Using level-aware calculations in
Amazon Quick](../../../quicksight/latest/user/level-aware-calculations.md "../../../quicksight/latest/user/level-aware-calculations.md").

## Example

The following example gets the distinct count of `Sales` partitioned
over `City` and `State` at the `PRE_AGG`
level.

```
distinctCountOver
(
  Sales,
  [City, State], PRE_AGG
)
```
