# Creating Alerts

Use the following procedure to create threshold alerts for KPI or Gauge visuals in
a dashboard.

###### To create an alert

1. Open Quick and navigate to the dashboard that you want.

For more information about viewing dashboards as a dashboard subscriber in
Quick, see [Interacting with Amazon Quick Sight dashboards](exploring-dashboards.md "exploring-dashboards.md"). 2. In the dashboard, select the visual that you want to create an alert for,
open the menu at the upper-right, and choose **Create
alert**. 3. On the menu at upper-right on the visual, choose the **Create
alert** icon.

Alternatively, you can choose the alert icon in the blue toolbar at upper
right. Then, in the **Create alert** page that opens,
select the KPI, Gauge, Table or Pivot table visual that you want to create
an alert for, and then choose **Next**.

You can also create alerts on table or pivot table visuals by selecing a
cell and choosing **Create alert**. You can only create
alerts for single cells. Alerts can't be created for entire columns or
for values that use a custom aggregation. For more information about custom
aggregations, see [Aggregate functions](calculated-field-aggregations.md "calculated-field-aggregations.md"). 4. On the **Create alert** page that opens at right, do the
following:

    1. For **Name**, enter a name for the alert.


    By default, the visual name is used for the alert name. You can
     change it if you want.
    2. For **Value to track**, choose a value that you
     want to set the threshold for. The information presented will vary
     based on the visual type you're creating an alert for.


    The values that are available for this option are based on the
     values the dashboard author sets in the visual. For example,
     let's say you have a KPI visual that shows a percent difference
     between two dates. Given that, you see two alert value options:
     percent difference and actual.


    If there is only one value in the visual, you can't change
     this option. It is the current value and it is displayed here so
     that you can use it as a reference while you choose a threshold. For
     example, if you're setting an alert on average cost, this value
     will show you what the current average cost is (say, $5). With this
     reference value you can make more informed decisions while setting
     your threshold.
    3. For **Condition**, choose a condition for the
     threshold.


    You can choose the following conditions.




    	* **Is above** – Sets a rule that
    	 the alert triggers if the alert value goes above the
    	 threshold you set.
    	* **Is below** – Sets a rule that
    	 the alert triggers if the alert value goes below the
    	 threshold that you set.
    	* **Is equal to** – Sets a rule that
    	 the alert triggers if the alert value is equal to the
    	 threshold you set.
    4. For **Threshold**, enter a value to prompt the
     alert.
    5. For **Notification preference**, choose how often
     you want to be notified about a breach to the threshold you
     set.


    You can choose from the following options.




    	* **As frequently as possible** - This
    	 option alerts you whenever the threshold is breached. If you
    	 choose this option, you might get alerts multiple times a
    	 day.
    	* **Daily at most** - This option alerts
    	 you once per day when the threshold is breached.
    	* **Weekly at most** - This option alerts
    	 you once per week when the threshold is breached.
    6. (Optional) Choose **Email me when there is no
     data** - When you select this option, you're
     notified when there's no data to check your alert rule
     against.
    7. Choose **Save**.


    A message at upper-right appears indicating that the alert has
     been saved. If your data crosses the threshold you set, you get a
     notification by email at the address that's associated with
     your Quick account.
