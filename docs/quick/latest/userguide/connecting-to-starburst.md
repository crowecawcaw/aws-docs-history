###### Note

Connectivity between Amazon Quick Sight and Starburst was validated using Starburst
version 420.

After you have successfully created a data source connection between your
Quick Sight and Starburst accounts, you can begin [Creating datasets](creating-data-sets.md "creating-data-sets.md") that contain
Starburst data.

## Creating an Quick Sight data

source connection to Starburst with OAuth client
credentials

You can use OAuth client credentials to connect your Quick Sight
account with Starburst through the [Quick Sight
APIs](../../../quicksight/latest/APIReference/API_CreateDataSource.md "../../../quicksight/latest/APIReference/API_CreateDataSource.md"). _OAuth_ is a standard
authorization protocol that is often utilized for applications that have advanced
security requirements. When you connect to Starburst with OAuth
client credentials, you can create datasets that contain Starburst data with the
Quick Sight APIs and in the Quick Sight UI. For more information about configuring
OAuth in Starburst, see [OAuth
2.0 authentication](https://docs.starburst.io/latest/security/oauth2.html "https://docs.starburst.io/latest/security/oauth2.html").

Quick Sight supports the `client credentials`
OAuth grant type. OAuth client credentials is used to
obtain an access token for machine-to-machine communication. This method is suitable
for scenarios where a client needs to access resources that are hosted on a server
without the involvement of a user.

In the client credentials flow of OAuth 2.0, there are several
client authentication mechanisms that can be used to authenticate the client
application with the authorization server. Quick Sight supports client credentials
based OAuth for Starburst for the following two mechanisms:

- **Token (Client secrets-based
  OAuth)**: The secret-based client authentication
  mechanism is used with the client credentials to grant flow in order to
  authenticate with authorization server. This authentication scheme requires
  the `client_id` and `client_secret` of the
  OAuth client app to be stored in Secrets Manager.
- **X509 (Client private key JWT-based
  OAuth)**: The X509 certificate key-based
  solution provides an additional security layer to the OAuth
  mechanism with client certificates that are used to authenticate instead of
  client secrets. This method is primarily used by private clients who use
  this method to authenticate with the authorization server with strong trust
  between the two services.

Quick Sight has validated OAuth connections with the following
Identity providers:

- OKTA
- PingFederate

### Storing

OAuth credentials in Secrets Manager

OAuth client credentials are meant for machine-to-machine use
cases and are not designed to be interactive. To create a datasource connection
between Quick Sight and Starburst, create a new secret in Secrets Manager that contains
your credentials for the OAuth client app. The secret ARN that is
created with the new secret can be used to create datasets that contain
Starburst data in Quick Sight. For more information about using Secrets Manager keys in
Quick Sight, see [Using AWS Secrets Manager secrets instead of
database credentials in Quick](secrets-manager-integration.md "secrets-manager-integration.md").

The credentials that you need to store in Secrets Manager are determined by the
OAuth mechanism that you use. The following key/value pairs
are required for X509-based OAuth secrets:

- `username`: The Starburst account username to be used when
  connecting to Starburst
- `client_id`: The OAuth client ID
- `client_private_key`: The OAuth client
  private key
- `client_public_key`: The OAuth client
  certificate public key and its encrypted algorithm (for example,
  `{"alg": "RS256", "kid", "cert_kid"}`)

The following key/value pairs are required for token-based
OAuth secrets:

- `username`: The Starburst account username to be used when
  connecting to Starburst
- `client_id`: The OAuth client ID
- `client_secret`: the OAuth client
  secret

### Creating a

Starburst OAuth connection with the Quick Sight APIs

After you create a secret in Secrets Manager that contains your Starburst
OAuth credentials and have connected your Quick
account to Secrets Manager, you can establish a data source connection between
Quick Sight and Starburst with the Quick Sight APIs and SDK. The following
example creates a Starburst data source connection using token
OAuth client credentials.

```
{
    "AwsAccountId": "`AWSACCOUNTID`",
    "DataSourceId": "`DATASOURCEID`",
    "Name": "`NAME`",
    "Type": "STARBURST",
    "DataSourceParameters": {
        "StarburstParameters": {
            "Host": "`STARBURST_HOST_NAME`",
            "Port": "`STARBURST_PORT`",
            "Catalog": "`STARBURST_CATALOG`",
            "ProductType": "`STARBURST_PRODUCT_TYPE`",
            "AuthenticationType": "TOKEN",
            "DatabaseAccessControlRole": "`starburst-db-access-role-name`",
            "OAuthParameters": {
              "TokenProviderUrl": "`oauth-access-token-endpoint`",
              "OAuthScope": "oauth-scope",
              "IdentityProviderResourceUri" : "`resource-uri`",
              "IdentityProviderVpcConnectionProperties" : {
                "VpcConnectionArn": "`IdP-VPC-connection-ARN`"
            }
        }
    },
    "VpcConnectionProperties": {
        "VpcConnectionArn": "`VPC-connection-ARN-for-Starburst`"
    },
    "Credentials": {
        "SecretArn": "`oauth-client-secret-ARN`"
    }
}
```

For more information about the CreateDatasource API operation, see [CreateDataSource](../../../quicksight/latest/APIReference/API_CreateDataSource.md "../../../quicksight/latest/APIReference/API_CreateDataSource.md").

Once the connection between Quick Sight and Starburst is established and a
data source is created with the Quick Sight APIs or SDK, the new data source is
displayed in Quick Sight. Quick Sight authors can use this data source to
create datasets that contain Starburst data. Tables are displayed based on the
role used in the `DatabaseAccessControlRole` parameter that is passed
in a `CreateDataSource` API call. If this parameter is not defined
when the data source connection is created, the default Starburst role is
used.

After you have successfully created a data source connection between your
Quick Sight and Starburst accounts, you can begin [Creating datasets](creating-data-sets.md "creating-data-sets.md") that
contain Starburst data.
