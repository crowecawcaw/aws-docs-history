## Key concepts

The following terms are used throughout this section.

**Data source**

A connection to an external data repository such as a database, data
warehouse, cloud service, or file. Data sources provide the raw data
for your analyses.

**Data preparation**

The process of transforming data for use in an analysis. This includes
filtering data, renaming fields, changing data types, adding calculated
fields, and creating SQL queries to refine data.

**Dataset**

A prepared collection of data ready for use in analyses and dashboards.
Datasets can be stored in SPICE for fast performance or queried directly
from the source.

**SPICE**

_SPICE (Super-fast, Parallel, In-memory
Calculation Engine)_ is the in-memory engine
that Quick Sight uses for high-performance analytics. SPICE speeds up
analytical queries on imported data so you don't need to retrieve data
from the source every time you change an analysis or update a
visual.

**Analysis**

The workspace for creating data visualizations. Each analysis contains
a collection of visualizations that you arrange and customize on one or
more sheets.

**Visual**

A graphical representation of data such as a chart, graph, or table.
All visuals begin in AutoGraph mode, which automatically selects the
best visualization type for the fields you select.

**Sheet**

A page within an analysis that displays a set of visualizations and
insights. You can add multiple sheets to an analysis and configure them
to work independently or together.

**Dashboard**

The published version of an analysis. You share dashboards with other
Quick users and control what they can do with the
data.
