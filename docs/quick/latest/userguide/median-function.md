# median
<a name="median-function"></a>

The `median` aggregation returns the median value of the specified measure, grouped by the chosen dimension or dimensions. For example, `median(revenue)` returns the median revenue grouped by the (optional) chosen dimension. 

## Syntax
<a name="median-function-syntax"></a>

```
median({{measure}}, [group-by level])
```

## Arguments
<a name="median-function-arguments"></a>

 *measure*   
The argument must be a measure. Null values are omitted from the results. Literal values don't work. The argument must be a field.

 *group-by level*   
(Optional) Specifies the level to group the aggregation by. The level added can be any dimension or dimensions independent of the dimensions added to the visual.  
The argument must be a dimension field. The group-by level must be enclosed in square brackets `[ ]`. For more information, see [Level-aware calculation - aggregate (LAC-A) functions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/quicksight/latest/user/level-aware-calculations-aggregate.html).

## Examples
<a name="median-function-example"></a>

The following example returns the median sales value for each region. It is compared to the total, maximum, and minimum sales.

```
median({Sales})
```

You can also specify at what level to group the computation using one or more dimensions in the view or in your dataset. This is called a LAC-A function. For more information about LAC-A functions, see [Level-aware calculation - aggregate (LAC-A) functions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/quicksight/latest/user/level-aware-calculations-aggregate.html). The following example calculates the median sales at the Country level, but not across other dimensions (Region) in the visual.

```
median({Sales}, [Country])
```
