# Creating a data source using

Presto

Presto (or PrestoDB) is an open-source, distributed SQL query engine, designed for
fast analytic queries against data of any size. It supports both nonrelational and
relational data sources. Supported nonrelational data sources include the Hadoop
Distributed File System (HDFS), Amazon S3, Cassandra, MongoDB, and HBase. Supported
relational data sources include MySQL, PostgreSQL, Amazon Redshift, Microsoft SQL Server, and
Teradata.

For more information about Presto, see the following:

- [Introduction to
  presto](https://aws.amazon.com/big-data/what-is-presto/ "https://aws.amazon.com/big-data/what-is-presto/"), a description of Presto on the AWS website.
- [Creating
  a presto cluster with Amazon elastic MapReduce (EMR)](../../../emr/latest/ReleaseGuide/emr-presto.md "../../../emr/latest/ReleaseGuide/emr-presto.md") in the
  _Amazon EMR Release Guide._
- For general information on Presto, see the [Presto documentation](https://trino.io/docs/current/ "https://trino.io/docs/current/").
  The results of the queries that you run through the Presto query engine can be turned
  into Quick Sight datasets. Presto processes the analytic queries on the backend
  databases. Then it returns results to the Quick Sight client. You can directly query
  your data through Presto, or you can import the results of your query into
  SPICE.

Before you use Quick Sight as a Presto client to run queries, make sure that you
configure data source profiles. You need a data source profile in Quick Sight for each
Presto data source that you want to access. Use the following procedure to create a
connection to Presto.

###### To create a new connection to a presto data source from Amazon Quick Sight (console)

1. On the Amazon Quick Sight start page, choose **Data** at left.
2. Choose **Create** then **New dataset**.
3. Choose the **Presto** tile.

###### Note

In most browsers, you can use Ctrl-F or Cmd-F to open a search box and
enter `presto` to locate it. 4. Add the settings for the new data source:

    * **Data source name**
     – Enter a descriptive name for your data source connection. This
     name appears in the **Existing data sources** section
     at the bottom of the **Data sets** screen.
    * **Connection type**
     – Choose the connection type that you need to use to connect to
     Presto.


    To connect through the public network, choose **Public
     network**.


    If you use a public network, your Presto server must be secured and
     authenticated using Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP). For
     information on configuring Presto to use LDAP, see [LDAP
     authentication](https://trino.io/docs/current/security/ldap.html "https://trino.io/docs/current/security/ldap.html") in the Presto documentation.


    To connect through a virtual private connection, choose the
     appropriate VPC name from the **VPC connections** list.


    If your Presto server allows unauthenticated access, AWS requires
     that you connect to it securely by using a private VPC connection. For
     information on configuring a new VPC, see [Configuring VPC connections in Amazon Quick Sight](working-with-aws-vpc.md "working-with-aws-vpc.md").
    * **Database server**
     – The name of the database server.
    * **Port** – The
     port that the server using to accept incoming connections from Amazon Quick Sight
    * **Catalog** –
     The name of the catalog that you want to use.
    * **Authentication
     required** – (Optional) This option only
     appears if you choose a VPC connection type. If the Presto data source
     that you're connecting to doesn't require authentication, choose
     **No**. Otherwise, keep the default setting
     (**Yes**).
    * **Username** –
     Enter a user name to use to connect to Presto. Quick Sight applies the
     same user name and password to all connections that use this data source
     profile. If you want to monitor Quick Sight separately from other
     accounts, create a Presto account for each Quick Sight data source
     profile.


    The Presto account that you use needs be able to access to the
     database and run `SELECT` statements on at least one table.
    * **Password** –
     The password to use with the Presto user name. Amazon Quick Sight encrypts all
     credentials that you use in data source profile. For more information,
     see [Data encryption in Amazon Quick](data-encryption.md "data-encryption.md").
    * **Enable SSL**
     – SSL is enabled by default.

5. Choose **Validate connection** to test your settings.
6. After you validate your settings, choose **Create data
   source** to complete the connection.
