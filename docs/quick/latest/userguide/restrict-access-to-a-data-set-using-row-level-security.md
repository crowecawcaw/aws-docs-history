# Using row-level

security with user-based rules to restrict access to a dataset

| \*_Applies<br>to:_<br>• Enterprise Edition |

In the Enterprise edition of Amazon Quick, you can restrict access to a dataset by
configuring row-level security (RLS) on it. You can do this before or after you have
shared the dataset. When you share a dataset with RLS with dataset owners, they can
still see all the data. When you share it with readers, however, they can only see the
data restricted by the permission dataset rules. By adding row-level security, you can
further control their access.

###### Note

When applying SPICE datasets to row-level security, each field in the dataset can
contain up to 2,047 Unicode characters. Fields that contain more than this quota are
truncated during ingestion. To learn more about SPICE data quotas, see [SPICE quotas for imported data](data-source-limits.md#spice-limits "data-source-limits.md#spice-limits").

To do this, you create a query or file with one column for user or group identification. You can use either
`UserName` and `GroupName`, or alternatively `UserARN` and `GroupARN`. You
can think of this as _adding a rule_ for that user or
group. Then you can add one column to the query or file for each field that you want to
grant or restrict access to. For each user or group name that you add, you add the
values for each field. You can use NULL (no value) to mean all values. To see examples
of dataset rules, see [Creating dataset
rules for row-level security](#create-data-set-rules-for-row-level-security "#create-data-set-rules-for-row-level-security").

To apply the dataset rules, you add the rules as a permissions dataset to your
dataset. Keep in mind the following points:

- The permissions dataset can't contain duplicate values. Duplicates are ignored
  when evaluating how to apply the rules.
- Each user or group specified can see only the rows that _match_ the field values in the dataset rules.
- If you add a rule for a user or group and leave all other columns with no
  value (NULL), you grant them access to all the data.
- If you don't add a rule for a user or group, that user or group can't see any
  of the data.
- The full set of rule records that are applied per user must not exceed 999.
  This limitation applies to the total number of rules that are directly assigned
  to a username, plus any rules that are assigned to the user through group names.
- If a field includes a comma (,) Amazon Quick treats each word separated from another
  by a comma as an individual value in the filter. For example, in `('AWS',
'INC')`, `AWS,INC` is considered as two strings:
  `AWS` and `INC`. To filter with `AWS,INC`,
  wrap the string with double quotation marks in the permissions dataset.

If the restricted dataset is a SPICE dataset, the number of
filter values applied per user can't exceed 192,000 for each restricted field.
This applies to the total number of filter values that are directly assigned to
a username, plus any filter values that are assigned to the user through group
names.

If the restricted dataset is a direct query dataset, the number of filter
values applied per user varies from data sources.

Exceeding the filter value limit may cause the visual rendering to fail. We
recommend adding an additional column to your restricted dataset to divide the
rows into groups based on the original restricted column so that the filter list
can be shortened.
Amazon Quick treats spaces as literal values. If you have a space in a field that you are
restricting, the dataset rule applies to those rows. Amazon Quick treats both NULLs and blanks
(empty strings "") as "no value". A NULL is an empty field value.

Depending on what data source your dataset is coming from, you can configure a direct
query to access a table of permissions. Terms with spaces inside them don't need to be
delimited with quotes. If you use a direct query, you can easily change the query in the
original data source.

Or you can upload dataset rules from a text file or spreadsheet. If you are using a
comma-separated value (CSV) file, don't include any spaces on the given line. Terms with
spaces inside them need to be delimited with quotation marks. If you use dataset rules
that are file-based, apply any changes by overwriting the existing rules in the
dataset's permissions settings.

Datasets that are restricted are marked with the word **RESTRICTED**
in the **Data** screen.

Child datasets that are created from a parent dataset that has RLS rules active retain
the same RLS rules that the parent dataset has. You can add more RLS rules to the child
dataset, but you can't remove the RLS rules that the dataset inherits from the parent
dataset.

Child datasets that are created from a parent dataset that has RLS rules active can
only be created with Direct Query. Child datasets that inherit the parent dataset's RLS
rules aren't supported in SPICE.

Row-level security works only for fields containing textual data (string, char,
varchar, and so on). It doesn't currently work for dates or numeric fields. Anomaly
detection is not supported for datasets that use row-level security (RLS).

## Creating dataset

rules for row-level security

Use the following procedure to create a permissions file or query to use as
dataset rules.

###### To create a permissions files or query to use as dataset rules

1. Create a file or a query that contains the dataset rules (permissions) for
   row-level security.

It doesn't matter what order the fields are in. However, all the fields
are case-sensitive. Make sure that they exactly match the field names and
values.

The structure should look similar to one of the following. Make sure that
you have at least one field that identifies either users or groups. You can
include both, but only one is required, and only one is used at a time. The
field that you use for users or groups can have any name you choose.

###### Note

If you are specifying groups, use only Amazon Quick groups or Microsoft AD
groups.

The following example shows a table with groups.

| GroupName           | Sales region | Segment                  |
| ------------------- | ------------ | ------------------------ |
| EMEA-Sales          | EMEA         | Enterprise, SMB, Startup |
| US-Sales            | US           | Enterprise               |
| US-Sales            | US           | SMB, Startup             |
| US-Sales            | US           | Startup                  |
| APAC-Sales          | APAC         | Enterprise, SMB          |
| Corporate-Reporting |              |                          |
| APAC-Sales          | APAC         | Enterprise, Startup      |

The following example shows a table with usernames.

| UserName              | Sales region | Segment                  |
| --------------------- | ------------ | ------------------------ |
| AlejandroRosalez      | EMEA         | Enterprise, SMB, Startup |
| MarthaRivera          | US           | Enterprise               |
| NikhilJayashankar     | US           | SMB, Startup             |
| PauloSantos           | US           | Startup                  |
| SaanviSarkar          | APAC         | Enterprise, SMB          |
| sales-tps@example.com |              |                          |
| ZhangWei              | APAC         | Enterprise, Startup      |

The following example shows a table with user and group Amazon Resource
Names (ARNs).

| UserARN                                                      | GroupARN                                                          | Sales region |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| `arn:aws:quicksight:us-east-1:123456789012:user/default/Bob` | `arn:aws:quicksight:us-east-1:123456789012:group/default/group-1` | APAC         |
| `arn:aws:quicksight:us-east-1:123456789012:user/default/Sam` | `arn:aws:quicksight:us-east-1:123456789012:group/default/group-2` | US           |

Or if you use a .csv file, the structure should look similar to one of the
following.

```
UserName,SalesRegion,Segment
AlejandroRosalez,EMEA,"Enterprise,SMB,Startup"
MarthaRivera,US,Enterprise
NikhilJayashankars,US,SMB
PauloSantos,US,Startup
SaanviSarkar,APAC,"SMB,Startup"
sales-tps@example.com,"",""
ZhangWei,APAC-Sales,"Enterprise,Startup"
```

```
GroupName,SalesRegion,Segment
EMEA-Sales,EMEA,"Enterprise,SMB,Startup"
US-Sales,US,Enterprise
US-Sales,US,SMB
US-Sales,US,Startup
APAC-Sales,APAC,"SMB,Startup"
Corporate-Reporting,"",""
APAC-Sales,APAC,"Enterprise,Startup"
```

```
UserARN,GroupARN,SalesRegion
arn:aws:quicksight:us-east-1:123456789012:user/Bob,arn:aws:quicksight:us-east-1:123456789012:group/group-1,APAC
arn:aws:quicksight:us-east-1:123456789012:user/Sam,arn:aws:quicksight:us-east-1:123456789012:group/group-2,US
```

Following is a SQL example.

```
/* for users*/
	select User as UserName, SalesRegion, Segment
	from tps-permissions;

	/* for groups*/
	select Group as GroupName, SalesRegion, Segment
	from tps-permissions;
```

2. Create a dataset for the dataset rules. To make sure that you can easily
   find it, give it a meaningful name, for example
   `Permissions-Sales-Pipeline`.

## Rules Dataset

flagging for row-level security

Use the following procedure to appropriately flag a dataset as a rules
dataset.

Rules Dataset is a flag that distinguishes permission datasets used for row-level
security from regular datasets. If a permissions dataset was applied to a regular
dataset before March 31, 2025, it will have a Rules Dataset flag in the
**Dataset** landing page.

If a permissions dataset was not applied to a regular dataset by March 31, 2025,
it will be categorized as a regular dataset. To use it as a rules dataset, duplicate
the permissions dataset and flag it as a rules dataset on the console when creating
the dataset. Select EDIT DATASET and under the options, choose DUPLICATE AS RULES
DATASET.

To successfully duplicate it as a rules dataset, ensure the original dataset has:

1.  Required user metadata or group metadata column(s) and 2. Only string type
    columns.

To create a new rules dataset on the console, select NEW RULES DATASET under the
NEW DATASET dropdown. When creating a rules dataset programmatically, add the
following parameter: [UseAs: RLS_RULES](../../../quicksight/latest/APIReference/API_CreateDataSet.md#API_CreateDataSet_RequestSyntax "../../../quicksight/latest/APIReference/API_CreateDataSet.md#API_CreateDataSet_RequestSyntax"). This is an optional parameter that is only used to
create a rules dataset. Once a dataset has been created, either through the console
or programmatically, and flagged as either a rules dataset or a regular dataset, it
cannot be changed.

Once datasets are flagged as rules datasets, Amazon Quick will apply strict SPICE
ingestion rules on them. To ensure data integrity, SPICE ingestions for rules
datasets will fail if there are invalid rows or cells exceeding length limits. You
must fix the ingestion issues in order to re-initiate a successful ingestion. Strict
ingestion rules are only applicable to rules datasets. Regular datasets will not
have dataset ingestion failures when there are skipped rows or string truncations.

## Applying row-level security

Use the following procedure to apply row-level security (RLS) by using a file or
query as a dataset that contains the rules for permissions.

###### To apply row-level security by using a file or query

1. Confirm that you have added your rules as a new dataset. If you added
   them, but don't see them under the list of datasets, refresh the
   screen.
2. On the **Data** page, choose the dataset
3. On the dataset details page that opens, for **Row-level
   security**, choose **Set up**.
4. On the **Set up row-level security** page that opens,
   choose **User-based rules**.
5. From the list of datasets that appears, choose your permissions dataset.

If your permissions dataset doesn't appear on this screen, return to
your datasets, and refresh the page. 6. For **Permissions policy** choose **Grant access
to dataset**. Each dataset has only one active permissions
dataset. If you try to add a second permissions dataset, it overwrites the
existing one.

###### Important

Some restrictions apply to NULL and empty string values when working
with row-level security:

    * If your dataset has NULL values or empty strings
     ("") in the restricted fields, these rows are ignored
     when the restrictions are applied.
    * Inside the permissions dataset, NULL values and empty strings
     are treated the same. For more information, see the following
     table.
    * To prevent accidentally exposing sensitive information,
     Amazon Quick skips empty RLS rules that grant access to everyone.
     An *empty RLS rule* occurs when all columns
     of a row have no value. Quick RLS treats NULL, empty
     strings (""), or empty comma separated strings (for example
     ",,,") as no value.




    	+ After skipping empty rules, other nonempty RLS rules
    	 still apply.
    	+ If a permission dataset has only empty rules and all
    	 of them were skipped, no one will have access to any
    	 data restricted by this permission dataset.

| Rules for UserName, GroupName, SalesRegion, Segment       | Granted access                                         |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| AlejandroRosalez,EMEA-Sales,EMEA,"Enterprise,SMB,Startup" | Sees all EMEA Enterprise, SMB, and Startup             |
| sales-tps@example.com,Corporate-Reporting,"",""           | Sees all rows                                          |
| User or group has no entry                                | Sees no rows                                           |
| “”,“”,“”,“”                                               | Skipped; sees no rows if all other rules are<br>empty. |
| NULL,“”,“”,NULL                                           | Skipped; sees no rows if all other rules are<br>empty. |

Anyone whom you shared your dashboard with can see all the data in it,
unless the dataset is restricted by dataset rules. 7. Choose **Apply dataset** to save your changes. Then, on
the **Save data set rules?** page, choose **Apply
and activate**. Changes in permissions apply immediately to
existing users. 8. (Optional) To remove permissions, first remove the dataset rules from the
dataset.

Make certain that the dataset rules are removed. Then, choose the
permissions dataset and choose **Remove data set**.

To overwrite permissions, choose a new permissions dataset and apply it.
You can reuse the same dataset name. However, make sure to apply the new
permissions in the **Permissions** screen to make these
permissions active. SQL queries dynamically update, so these can be managed
outside of Amazon Quick. For queries, the permissions are updated when the direct
query cache is automatically refreshed.

If you delete a file-based permissions dataset before you remove it from the
target dataset, restricted users can't access the dataset. While the dataset is in
this state, it remains marked as **RESTRICTED**. However, when you
view **Permissions** for that dataset, you can see that it has no
selected dataset rules.

To fix this, specify new dataset rules. Creating a dataset with the same name is
not enough to fix this. You must choose the new permissions dataset on the
**Permissions** screen. This restriction doesn't apply to
direct SQL queries.
