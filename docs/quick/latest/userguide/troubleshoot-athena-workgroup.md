# Workgroup and output errors when

using Athena with Quick Sight

To verify that workgroups are set up properly, check the following
settings:

- **The Athena workgroup that's associated with the data
  source must exist.**

To fix this, you can return to the Athena data source settings and choose a
different workgroup. For more information, see [Setting
Up Workgroups](../../../athena/latest/ug/workgroups-procedure.md "../../../athena/latest/ug/workgroups-procedure.md") in the _Athena User
Guide_.

Another solution is to have the AWS account administrator recreate the
workgroup in the Athena console.

- **The Athena workgroup that's associated with the data
  source must be enabled.**

An AWS account administrator needs to enable the workgroup in the Athena
console. Open the Athena console by using this direct link:
[https://console.aws.amazon.com/athena/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/athena/home "https://console.aws.amazon.com/athena/home"). Then choose the appropriate workgroup in the
**Workgroup** panel and view its settings. Choose
**Enable workgroup**.

- **Make sure that you have access to the Amazon S3 output
  location that's associated with the Athena workgroup.**

To grant Amazon Quick Sight permissions to access the S3 output location, the Amazon Quick Sight
administrator can edit **Security & Permissions** in
the **Manage QuickSight** screen.

- **The Athena workgroup must have an associated S3
  output location.**

An AWS account administrator needs to associate an S3 bucket with the
workgroup in the Athena console. Open the Athena console by using this direct
link: [https://console.aws.amazon.com/athena/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/athena/home "https://console.aws.amazon.com/athena/home"). Then choose the appropriate workgroup in the
**Workgroup** panel and view its settings. Set
**Query result location**.
