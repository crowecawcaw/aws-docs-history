# Table not found when using Athena with Amazon Quick Sight
<a name="troubleshoot-athena-table-not-found"></a>

You can receive a "`table not found`" error if the tables in an analysis are missing from the Athena data source. 

In the Athena console ([https://console.aws.amazon.com/athena/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/athena/home)), check for your table under the corresponding schema. You can recreate the table in Athena and then create a new dataset in Amazon Quick Sight on that table. To investigate how the table was lost in the first place, you can use the Athena console to check the query history. Doing this helps you find the queries that dropped the table.

If this error happened when you were editing a custom SQL query in preview, verify that the name of the table in the query, and check for any other syntax errors. Amazon Quick Sight can't infer the schema from the query. The schema must be specified in the query. 

For example, the following statement works.

```
select from my_schema.my_table
```

The following statement fails because it's missing the schema.

```
select from my_table
```

If you still have the issue, verify that your tables, columns, and queries comply with Athena requirements.
