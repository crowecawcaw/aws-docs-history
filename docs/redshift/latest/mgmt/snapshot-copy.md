Amazon Redshift will no longer support the use of Python UDFs after June 30, 2026.
We will start enforcing it in phases. For more information on the details of Python end of life

# Copying an automated snapshot

Automated snapshots are automatically deleted when their retention period expires, when
you disable automated snapshots, or when you delete a cluster. If you want to keep an
automated snapshot, you can copy it to a manual snapshot.

###### To copy an automated snapshot

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon Redshift console at
   [https://console.aws.amazon.com/redshiftv2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/redshiftv2/ "https://console.aws.amazon.com/redshiftv2/").
2. On the navigation menu, choose **Clusters**,
   **Snapshots**, then choose the snapshot to copy.
3. For **Actions**, choose **Copy automated
   snapshot** to copy the snapshot.
4. Update the properties of the new snapshot, then choose **Copy**.
