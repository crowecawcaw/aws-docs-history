Amazon Redshift will no longer support the use of Python UDFs after June 30, 2026.
We will start enforcing it in phases. For more information on the details of Python end of life
and migration options, see the
[blog post](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/big-data/amazon-redshift-python-user-defined-functions-will-reach-end-of-support-after-june-30-2026/ "https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/big-data/amazon-redshift-python-user-defined-functions-will-reach-end-of-support-after-june-30-2026/") that was published on June 30, 2025.

# ST\_Contains

ST\_Contains returns true if the 2D projection of the first input geometry contains the 2D projection of the second input
geometry. Geometry `A` contains geometry `B` if every point in
`B` is a point in `A`, and their interiors have nonempty
intersection.

ST\_Contains(`A`, `B`) is equivalent to ST\_Within(`B`, `A`).

## Syntax

```
ST_Contains(*geom1*, *geom2*)
```

## Arguments

_geom1_

A value of data type `GEOMETRY` or an expression that evaluates to a `GEOMETRY` type.

_geom2_

A value of data type `GEOMETRY` or an expression that evaluates to a `GEOMETRY` type. This value is compared with _geom1_ to determine if it is contained within _geom1_.

## Return type

`BOOLEAN`

If _geom1_ or _geom2_ is null, then null is returned.

If _geom1_ and _geom2_ don't have the same
value for the spatial reference system identifier (SRID), then an error is returned.

If _geom1_ or _geom2_ is a geometry collection, then an error is returned.

## Examples

The following SQL checks if the first polygon contains the second polygon.

```
SELECT ST_Contains(ST_GeomFromText('POLYGON((0 2,1 1,0 -1,0 2))'), ST_GeomFromText('POLYGON((-1 3,2 1,0 -3,-1 3))'));
```

```
