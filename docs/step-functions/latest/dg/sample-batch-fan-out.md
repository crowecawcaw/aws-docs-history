# Fan out batch jobs with Map state

This sample project demonstrates how to use Step Functions’s [Map workflow state](state-map.md "state-map.md") state to fan out AWS Batch jobs.

In this project, Step Functions uses a state machine to invoke a Lambda function to do simple pre-processing, then invokes
multiple AWS Batch jobs in parallel using the [Map workflow state](state-map.md "state-map.md") state.

## Step 1: Create the state machine

1. Open the [Step Functions console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/states/home?region=us-east-1#/ "https://console.aws.amazon.com/states/home?region=us-east-1#/") and choose **Create state machine**.
2. Choose **Create from template** and find the related starter template. Choose **Next** to continue.
3. Choose how to use the template:
   1. **Run a demo** – creates a read-only state machine. After review, you can create the workflow and all related resources.
   2. **Build on it** – provides an editable workflow definition that you can review, customize, and deploy with your own resources. (Related resources, such as functions or queues, will **not** be created automatically.)

4. Choose **Use template** to continue with your selection.

###### Note

_Standard charges apply for services deployed to your account._

## Step 2: Run the demo state machine

If you chose the **Run a demo** option, all related resources will be deployed and ready to run. If you chose the **Build on it** option, you might need to set placeholder values and create additional resources before you can run your custom workflow.

1. Choose **Deploy and run**.
2. Wait for the CloudFormation stack to deploy. This can take up to 10 minutes.
3. After the **Start execution** option appears, review the **Input** and choose **Start execution**.

###### Congratulations!

You should now have a running demo of your state machine. You can choose states in the **Graph view** to review input, output, variables, definition, and events.
