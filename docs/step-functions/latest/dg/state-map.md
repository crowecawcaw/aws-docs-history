# Map workflow state

Use the `Map` state to run a set of workflow steps for each item in a
dataset. The `Map` state's iterations run in parallel, which makes it possible to
process a dataset quickly. `Map` states can use a variety of input types,
including a JSON array, a list of Amazon S3 objects, or a CSV file.

Step Functions provides two types of processing modes for using the `Map` state in your
workflows: _Inline_ mode and _Distributed_
mode.

###### Tip

To deploy an example of a workflow that uses a `Map` state, see [Processing arrays of data with Choice and Map](https://catalog.workshops.aws/stepfunctions/choice-and-map "https://catalog.workshops.aws/stepfunctions/choice-and-map") in _The AWS Step Functions Workshop_.

## Map state processing modes

Step Functions provides the following processing modes for the `Map` state depending on how you want to process the items in a dataset.

- **Inline** – Limited-concurrency mode. In this mode, each iteration of the `Map` state runs in the context of the workflow that contains the `Map` state. Step Functions adds the execution history of these iterations to the parent workflow's execution history.
  By default, `Map` states run in Inline mode.

In this mode, the `Map` state accepts only a JSON array as input. Also, this mode supports up to 40 concurrent iterations.

For more information, see [Using Map state in Inline mode in Step Functions workflows](state-map-inline.md "state-map-inline.md").

- **Distributed** – High-concurrency mode. In this mode, the `Map` state runs each iteration as a child workflow execution, which enables high concurrency of up to 10,000 parallel child workflow executions. Each child workflow execution has its own, separate execution history from that of the parent workflow.

In this mode, the `Map` state can accept either a JSON array or an Amazon S3
data source, such as a CSV file, as its input.

For more information, see [Distributed mode](state-map-distributed.md "state-map-distributed.md").

The mode you should use depends on how you want to process the
items in a dataset. Use the `Map` state in Inline mode if your workflow's execution history won't exceed 25,000 entries, or if you don't require more than 40 concurrent iterations.

Use the `Map` state in Distributed mode when you need to orchestrate large-scale parallel workloads that meet any combination of the following conditions:

- The size of your dataset exceeds 256 KiB.
- The workflow's execution event history would exceed 25,000 entries.
- You need a concurrency of more than 40 concurrent iterations.
