## About AWS SDK for JavaScript

The AWS SDK for JavaScript provides access to AWS services using either browser scripts or
Node.js. This documentation focuses on the latest version of the SDK (V3). The AWS SDK for JavaScript
V3 is maintained by AWS as an [open-source project hosted on GitHub](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-js-v3 "https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-js-v3"). Issues and feature requests are
public and you can access them on the issues page for the GitHub repository.

JavaScript V2 is similar to V3, but contains syntax differences. V3 is more modular,
making it easier to ship smaller dependencies, and has first-class TypeScript support.
We recommend using the latest version of the SDK.

## Using the AWS SDK for JavaScript

V3

You can add the SDK to your Node.js application using the Node Package Manager. The
examples below show how to add the most common SDK packages for working with
DynamoDB.

- `npm install @aws-sdk/client-dynamodb`
- `npm install @aws-sdk/lib-dynamodb`
- `npm install @aws-sdk/util-dynamodb`

Installing packages adds references to the dependency section of your package.json
project file. You have the option to use the newer ECMAScript module syntax. For further
details on these two approaches, see the Considerations section.

## Accessing JavaScript

documentation

Get started with JavaScript documentation with the following resources:

- Access the [Developer guide](../../../sdk-for-javascript/v3/developer-guide/welcome.md "../../../sdk-for-javascript/v3/developer-guide/welcome.md") for core JavaScript documentation. Installation
  instructions are located in the **Setting up** section.
- Access the [API reference](../../../AWSJavaScriptSDK/v3/latest/introduction.md "../../../AWSJavaScriptSDK/v3/latest/introduction.md") documentation to explore all available classes and
  methods.
- The SDK for JavaScript supports many AWS services other than DynamoDB. Use the
  following procedure to locate specific API coverage for DynamoDB:
  1.  From **Services**, choose **DynamoDB and
      Libraries**. This documents the low-level client.
  2.  Choose **lib-dynamodb**. This documents the
      high-level client. The two clients represent two different abstraction
      layers that you have the choice to use. See the section below for more
      information about abstraction layers.

## Abstraction

layers

The SDK for JavaScript V3 has a low-level client (`DynamoDBClient`) and a
high-level client (`DynamoDBDocumentClient`).

###### Topics

- [Low-level client
  (DynamoDBClient)](#programming-with-javascript-low-level-client "#programming-with-javascript-low-level-client")
- [High-level client
  (DynamoDBDocumentClient)](#programming-with-javascript-high-level-client "#programming-with-javascript-high-level-client")

### Low-level client

(`DynamoDBClient`)

The low-level client provides no extra abstractions over the underlying wire
protocol. It gives you full control over all aspects of communication, but because
there are no abstractions, you must do things like provide item definitions using
the DynamoDB JSON format.

As the example below shows, with this format data types must be stated explicitly.
An _S_ indicates a string value and an _N_ indicates a number value. Numbers on the wire are
always sent as strings tagged as number types to ensure no loss in precision. The
low-level API calls have a naming pattern such as `PutItemCommand` and
`GetItemCommand`.

The following example is using low-level client with `Item` defined
using DynamoDB JSON:

```
const { DynamoDBClient, PutItemCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-dynamodb");

const client = new DynamoDBClient({});

async function addProduct() {
  const params = {
    TableName: "products",
    Item: {
      "id": { S: "Product01" },
      "description": { S: "Hiking Boots" },
      "category": { S: "footwear" },
      "sku": { S: "hiking-sku-01" },
      "size": { N: "9" }
    }
  };

  try {
    const data = await client.send(new PutItemCommand(params));
    console.log('result : ' + JSON.stringify(data));
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error:", error);
  }
}
addProduct();

```

### High-level client

(`DynamoDBDocumentClient`)

The high-level DynamoDB document client offers built-in convenience features, such as
eliminating the need to manually marshal data and allowing for direct reads and
writes using standard JavaScript objects. The [documentation for `lib-dynamodb`](../../../AWSJavaScriptSDK/v3/latest/Package/-aws-sdk-lib-dynamodb.md "../../../AWSJavaScriptSDK/v3/latest/Package/-aws-sdk-lib-dynamodb.md") provides the list of
advantages.

To instantiate the `DynamoDBDocumentClient`, construct a low-level
`DynamoDBClient` and then wrap it with a
`DynamoDBDocumentClient`. The function naming convention differs
slightly between the two packages. For instance, the low-level uses
`PutItemCommand` while the high-level uses `PutCommand`.
The distinct names allow both sets of functions to coexist in the same context,
allowing you to mix both in the same script.

```
const { DynamoDBClient } = require("@aws-sdk/client-dynamodb");
const { DynamoDBDocumentClient, PutCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/lib-dynamodb");

const client = new DynamoDBClient({});

const docClient = DynamoDBDocumentClient.from(client);

async function addProduct() {
  const params = {
    TableName: "products",
    Item: {
      id: "Product01",
      description: "Hiking Boots",
      category: "footwear",
      sku: "hiking-sku-01",
      size: 9,
    },
  };

  try {
    const data = await docClient.send(new PutCommand(params));
    console.log('result : ' + JSON.stringify(data));
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error:", error);
  }
}

addProduct();

```

The pattern of usage is consistent when you're reading items using API operations
such as `GetItem`, `Query`, or `Scan`.

## Using the marshall

utility function

You can use the low-level client and marshall or unmarshall the data types on your
own. The utility package, [util-dynamodb](../../../AWSJavaScriptSDK/v3/latest/Package/-aws-sdk-util-dynamodb.md "../../../AWSJavaScriptSDK/v3/latest/Package/-aws-sdk-util-dynamodb.md"), has a `marshall()` utility function that accepts
JSON and produces DynamoDB JSON, as well as an `unmarshall()` function, that
does the reverse. The following example uses the low-level client with data marshalling
handled by the `marshall()` call.

```
const { DynamoDBClient, PutItemCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-dynamodb");
const { marshall } = require("@aws-sdk/util-dynamodb");

const client = new DynamoDBClient({});

async function addProduct() {
  const params = {
    TableName: "products",
    Item: marshall({
      id: "Product01",
      description: "Hiking Boots",
      category: "footwear",
      sku: "hiking-sku-01",
      size: 9,
    }),
  };

  try {
    const data = await client.send(new PutItemCommand(params));
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error:", error);
  }
}
addProduct();

```

## Reading items

To read a single item from DynamoDB, you use the `GetItem` API operation.
Similar to the `PutItem` command, you have the choice to use either the
low-level client or the high-level Document client. The example below demonstrates using
the high-level Document client to retrieve an item.

```
const { DynamoDBClient } = require("@aws-sdk/client-dynamodb");
const { DynamoDBDocumentClient, GetCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/lib-dynamodb");

const client = new DynamoDBClient({});

const docClient = DynamoDBDocumentClient.from(client);

async function getProduct() {
  const params = {
    TableName: "products",
    Key: {
      id: "Product01",
    },
  };

  try {
    const data = await docClient.send(new GetCommand(params));
    console.log('result : ' + JSON.stringify(data));
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error:", error);
  }
}

getProduct();

```

Use the `Query` API operation to read multiple items. You can use the
low-level client or the Document client. The example below uses the high-level Document
client.

```
const { DynamoDBClient } = require("@aws-sdk/client-dynamodb");
const {
  DynamoDBDocumentClient,
  QueryCommand,
} = require("@aws-sdk/lib-dynamodb");

const client = new DynamoDBClient({});

const docClient = DynamoDBDocumentClient.from(client);

async function productSearch() {
  const params = {
    TableName: "products",
    IndexName: "GSI1",
    KeyConditionExpression: "#category = :category and begins_with(#sku, :sku)",
    ExpressionAttributeNames: {
      "#category": "category",
      "#sku": "sku",
    },
    ExpressionAttributeValues: {
      ":category": "footwear",
      ":sku": "hiking",
    },
  };

  try {
    const data = await docClient.send(new QueryCommand(params));
    console.log('result : ' + JSON.stringify(data));
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error:", error);
  }
}

productSearch();

```

## Conditional

writes

DynamoDB write operations can specify a logical condition expression that must evaluate
to true for the write to proceed. If the condition does not evaluate to true, the write
operation generates an exception. The condition expression can check if the item already
exists or if its attributes match certain constraints.

`ConditionExpression = "version = :ver AND size(VideoClip) < :maxsize"`

When the conditional expression fails, you can use
`ReturnValuesOnConditionCheckFailure` to request that the error response
include the item that didn't satisfy the conditions to deduce what the problem was. For
more details, see [Handle conditional write errors in high concurrency scenarios with
Amazon DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/database/handle-conditional-write-errors-in-high-concurrency-scenarios-with-amazon-dynamodb/ "https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/database/handle-conditional-write-errors-in-high-concurrency-scenarios-with-amazon-dynamodb/").

```
try {
      const response = await client.send(new PutCommand({
          TableName: "YourTableName",
          Item: item,
          ConditionExpression: "attribute_not_exists(pk)",
          ReturnValuesOnConditionCheckFailure: "ALL_OLD"
      }));
  } catch (e) {
      if (e.name === 'ConditionalCheckFailedException') {
          console.log('Item already exists:', e.Item);
      } else {
          throw e;
      }
  }

```

Additional code examples showing other aspects of JavsScript SDK V3 usage are
available in the [JavaScript SDK V3 Documentation](../../../sdk-for-javascript/v3/developer-guide/javascript_dynamodb_code_examples.md "../../../sdk-for-javascript/v3/developer-guide/javascript_dynamodb_code_examples.md") and under the [DynamoDB-SDK-Examples GitHub repository](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-dynamodb-examples/tree/master/examples/SDK/node.js "https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-dynamodb-examples/tree/master/examples/SDK/node.js").

## Pagination

###### Topics

- [Using the
  paginateScan convenience method](#using-the-paginatescan-convenience-method "#using-the-paginatescan-convenience-method")

Read requests such as `Scan` or `Query` will likely return
multiple items in a dataset. If you perform a `Scan` or `Query`
with a `Limit` parameter, then once the system has read that many items, a
partial response will be sent, and you'll need to paginate to retrieve additional
items.

The system will only read a maximum of 1 megabyte of data per request. If you're
including a `Filter` expression, the system will still read a megabyte, at
maximum, of data from disk, but will return the items of that megabyte that match the
filter. The filter operation could return 0 items for a page, but still require further
pagination before the search is exhausted.

You should look for `LastEvaluatedKey` in the response and using it as the
`ExclusiveStartKey` parameter in a subsequent request to continue data
retrieval. This serves as a bookmark as noted in the following example.

###### Note

The sample passes a null `lastEvaluatedKey` as the
`ExclusiveStartKey` on the first iteration and this is
allowed.

Example using the `LastEvaluatedKey`:

```
const { DynamoDBClient, ScanCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-dynamodb");

const client = new DynamoDBClient({});

async function paginatedScan() {
  let lastEvaluatedKey;
  let pageCount = 0;

  do {
    const params = {
      TableName: "products",
      ExclusiveStartKey: lastEvaluatedKey,
    };

    const response = await client.send(new ScanCommand(params));
    pageCount++;
    console.log(`Page ${pageCount}, Items:`, response.Items);
    lastEvaluatedKey = response.LastEvaluatedKey;
  } while (lastEvaluatedKey);
}

paginatedScan().catch((err) => {
  console.error(err);
});

```

### Using the

`paginateScan` convenience method

The SDK provides convenience methods called `paginateScan` and
`paginateQuery` that do this work for you and makes the repeated
requests behind the scenes. Specify the max number of items to read per request
using the standard `Limit` parameter.

```
const { DynamoDBClient, paginateScan } = require("@aws-sdk/client-dynamodb");

const client = new DynamoDBClient({});

async function paginatedScanUsingPaginator() {
  const params = {
    TableName: "products",
    Limit: 100
  };

  const paginator = paginateScan({client}, params);

  let pageCount = 0;

  for await (const page of paginator) {
    pageCount++;
    console.log(`Page ${pageCount}, Items:`, page.Items);
  }
}

paginatedScanUsingPaginator().catch((err) => {
  console.error(err);
});

```

###### Note

Performing full table scans regularly is not a recommended access pattern unless
the table is small.

## Specifying configuration

###### Topics

- [Config for
  timeouts](#programming-with-javascript-config-timeouts "#programming-with-javascript-config-timeouts")
- [Config for
  keep-alive](#programming-with-javascript-config-keep-alive "#programming-with-javascript-config-keep-alive")
- [Config for
  retries](#programming-with-javascript-config-retries "#programming-with-javascript-config-retries")

When setting up the `DynamoDBClient`, you can specify various configuration
overrides by passing a configuration object to the constructor. For example, you can
specify the Region to connect to if it's not already known to the calling context or the
endpoint URL to use. This is useful if you want to target a DynamoDB Local instance for
development purposes.

```
const client = new DynamoDBClient({
  region: "eu-west-1",
  endpoint: "http://localhost:8000",
});

```

### Config for

timeouts

DynamoDB uses HTTPS for client-server communication. You can control some aspects of
the HTTP layer by providing a `NodeHttpHandler` object. For example, you
can adjust the key timeout values `connectionTimeout` and
`requestTimeout`. The `connectionTimeout` is the maximum
duration, in milliseconds, that the client will wait while trying to establish a
connection before giving up.

The `requestTimeout` defines how long the client will wait for a
response after a request has been sent, also in milliseconds. The defaults for both
are zero, meaning the timeout is disabled and there's no limit on how long the
client will wait if the response does not arrive. You should set the timeouts to
something reasonable so in the event of a network issue the request will error out
and a new request can be initiated. For example:

```
import { DynamoDBClient } from "@aws-sdk/client-dynamodb";
import { NodeHttpHandler } from "@smithy/node-http-handler";

const requestHandler = new NodeHttpHandler({
  connectionTimeout: 2000,
  requestTimeout: 2000,
});

const client = new DynamoDBClient({
  requestHandler
});

```

###### Note

The example provided uses the [Smithy](https://smithy.io/2.0/index.html "https://smithy.io/2.0/index.html") import. Smithy is a language for defining services and SDKs,
open-source and maintained by AWS.

In addition to configuring timeout values, you can set the maximum number of
sockets, which allows for an increased number of concurrent connections per origin.
The developer guide includes [details on configuring the `maxSockets` parameter](../../../sdk-for-javascript/v3/developer-guide/node-configuring-maxsockets.md "../../../sdk-for-javascript/v3/developer-guide/node-configuring-maxsockets.md").

### Config for

keep-alive

When using HTTPS, the first request always takes some back-and-forth communication
to establish a secure connection. HTTP Keep-Alive allows subsequent requests to
reuse the already-established connection, making the requests more efficient and
lowering latency. HTTP Keep-Alive is enabled by default with JavaScript V3.

There's a limit to how long an idle connection can be kept alive. Consider sending
periodic requests, maybe every minute, if you have an idle connection but want the
next request to use an already-established connection.

###### Note

Note that in the older V2 of the SDK, keep-alive was off by default, meaning
each connection would get closed immediately after use. If using V2, you can
override this setting.

### Config for

retries

When the SDK receives an error response and the error is resumable as determined
by the SDK, such as a throttling exception or a temporary service exception, it will
retry again. This happens invisibly to you as the caller, except that you might
notice the request took longer to succeed.

The SDK for JavaScript V3 will make 3 total requests, by default, before giving up
and passing the error into the calling context. You can adjust the number and
frequency of these retries.

The `DynamoDBClient` constructor accepts a `maxAttempts`
setting that limits how many attempts will happen. The below example raises the
value from the default of 3 to a total of 5. If you set it to 0 or 1, that indicates
you don't want any automatic retries and want to handle any resumable errors
yourself within your catch block.

```
const client = new DynamoDBClient({
  maxAttempts: 5,
});

```

You can also control the timing of the retries with a custom retry strategy. To do
this, import the `util-retry` utility package and create a custom backoff
function that calculates the wait time between retries based on the current retry
count.

The example below says to make a maximum of 5 attempts with delays of 15, 30, 90,
and 360 milliseconds should the first attempt fail. The custom backoff function,
`calculateRetryBackoff`, calculates the delays by accepting the
retry attempt number (starts with 1 for the first retry) and returns how many
milliseconds to wait for that request.

```
const { ConfiguredRetryStrategy } = require("@aws-sdk/util-retry");

const calculateRetryBackoff = (attempt) => {
  const backoffTimes = [15, 30, 90, 360];
  return backoffTimes[attempt - 1] || 0;
};

const client = new DynamoDBClient({
  retryStrategy: new ConfiguredRetryStrategy(
    5, // max attempts.
    calculateRetryBackoff // backoff function.
  ),
});

```

## Waiters

The DynamoDB client includes two useful [waiter functions](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/dynamodb/wait/index.html#cli-aws-dynamodb-wait "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/dynamodb/wait/index.html#cli-aws-dynamodb-wait") that can be used when creating, modifying, or deleting
tables when you want your code to wait to proceed until the table modification has
finished. For example, you can deploy a table, call the
`waitUntilTableExists` function, and the code will block until the table
has been made **ACTIVE**. The waiter internally polls the DynamoDB service
with a `describe-table` every 20 seconds.

```
import {waitUntilTableExists, waitUntilTableNotExists} from "@aws-sdk/client-dynamodb";

… <create table details>

const results = await waitUntilTableExists({client: client, maxWaitTime: 180}, {TableName: "products"});
if (results.state == 'SUCCESS') {
  return results.reason.Table
}
console.error(`${results.state} ${results.reason}`);

```

The `waitUntilTableExists` feature returns control only when it can perform
a `describe-table` command that shows the table status
**ACTIVE**. This ensures that you can use
`waitUntilTableExists` to wait for the completion of creation, as well as
modifications such as adding a GSI index, which may take some time to apply before the
table returns to **ACTIVE** status.

## Error handling

In the early examples here, we've caught all errors broadly. However, in practical
applications, it's important to discern between various error types and implement more
precise error handling.

DynamoDB error responses contain metadata, including the name of the error. You can catch
errors then match against the possible string names of error conditions to determine how
to proceed. For server-side errors, you can leverage the `instanceof`
operator with the error types exported by the `@aws-sdk/client-dynamodb`
package to manage error handling efficiently.

It's important to note that these errors only manifest after all retries have been
exhausted. If an error is retried and is eventually followed by a successful call, from
the code's perspective, there's no error just a slightly elevated latency. Retries will
show up in Amazon CloudWatch charts as unsuccessful requests, such as throttle or error requests.
If the client reaches the maximum retry count, it will give up and generate an
exception. This is the client's way of saying it's not going to retry.

Below is a snippet to catch the error and take action based on the type of error that
was returned.

```
import {
  ResourceNotFoundException
  ProvisionedThroughputExceededException,
  DynamoDBServiceException,
} from "@aws-sdk/client-dynamodb";

try {
  await client.send(someCommand);
} catch (e) {
    if (e instanceof ResourceNotFoundException) {
      // Handle ResourceNotFoundException
    } else if (e instanceof ProvisionedThroughputExceededException) {
      // Handle ProvisionedThroughputExceededException
    } else if (e instanceof DynamoDBServiceException) {
      // Handle DynamoDBServiceException
    } else {
      // Other errors such as those from the SDK
      if (e.name === "TimeoutError") {
        // Handle SDK TimeoutError.
      } else {
        // Handle other errors.
      }
    }
}

```

See [Error handling with DynamoDB](Programming.md "Programming.md") for common error strings in the _DynamoDB Developer Guide_. The exact errors possible with
any particular API call can be found in the documentation for that API call, such as the
[Query API docs](../APIReference/API_Query.md "../APIReference/API_Query.md").

The metadata of errors include additional properties, depending on the error. For
a `TimeoutError`, the metadata includes the number of attempts that were
made and the `totalRetryDelay`, as shown below.

```
{
  "name": "TimeoutError",
  "$metadata": {
    "attempts": 3,
    "totalRetryDelay": 199
  }
}

```

If you manage your own retry policy, you'll want to differentiate between throttles
and errors:

- A **throttle** (indicated by a`ProvisionedThroughputExceededException` or
  `ThrottlingException`) indicates a healthy service that's
  informing you that you've exceeded your read or write capacity on a DynamoDB table
  or partition. Every millisecond that passes, a bit more read or write capacity
  is made available, and so you can retry quickly, such as every 50ms, to attempt
  to access that newly released capacity.

With throttles you don't especially need exponential backoff because
throttles are lightweight for DynamoDB to return and incur no per-request charge to
you. Exponential backoff assigns longer delays to client threads that have
already waited the longest, which statistically extends the p50 and p99
outward.

- An **error** (indicated by an`InternalServerError` or a `ServiceUnavailable`, among
  others) indicates a transient issue with the service, possibly the whole table
  or just the partition you're reading from or writing to. With errors, you can
  pause longer before retries, such as 250ms or 500ms, and use jitter to stagger
  the retries.

## Logging

Turn on logging to get more details about what the SDK is doing. You can set a
parameter on the `DynamoDBClient` as shown in the example below. More log
information will appear in the console and includes metadata such as the status code and
the consumed capacity. If you run the code locally in a terminal window, the logs appear
there. If you run the code in AWS Lambda, and you have Amazon CloudWatch logs set up, then the
console output will be written there.

```
const client = new DynamoDBClient({
  logger: console
});

```

You can also hook into the internal SDK activities and perform custom logging as
certain events happen. The example below uses the client's `middlewareStack`
to intercept each request as it's being sent from the SDK and logs it as it's
happening.

```
const client = new DynamoDBClient({});

client.middlewareStack.add(
  (next) => async (args) => {
    console.log("Sending request from AWS SDK", { request: args.request });
    return next(args);
  },
  {
    step: "build",
    name: "log-ddb-calls",
  }
);

```

The `MiddlewareStack` provides a powerful hook for observing and
controlling SDK behavior. See the blog [Introducing Middleware Stack in Modular AWS SDK for JavaScript](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/developer/middleware-stack-modular-aws-sdk-js/ "https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/developer/middleware-stack-modular-aws-sdk-js/"), for more
information.

## Considerations

When implementing the AWS SDK for JavaScript in your project, here are some further factors to
consider.

**Module systems**

The SDK supports two module systems, CommonJS and ES (ECMAScript).
CommonJS uses the `require` function, while ES uses the
`import` keyword.

1. **Common JS** – `const {
DynamoDBClient, PutItemCommand } =
require("@aws-sdk/client-dynamodb");`
2. **ES (ECMAScript**
   –
   `import { DynamoDBClient, PutItemCommand }
from
"@aws-sdk/client-dynamodb";`

The project type dictates the module system to be used and is specified in
the type section of your package.json file. The default is CommonJS. Use
`"type": "module"` to indicate an ES project. If you have an
existing Node.JS project that uses the CommonJS package format, you can
still add functions with the more modern SDK V3 Import syntax by naming your
function files with the .mjs extension. This will allow the code file to be
treated as ES (ECMAScript).

**Asynchronous operations**

You'll see many code samples using callbacks and promises to handle the
result of DynamoDB operations. With modern JavaScript this complexity is no
longer needed and developers can take advantage of the more succinct and
readable async/await syntax for asynchronous operations.

**Web browser runtime**

Web and mobile developers building with React or React Native can use the
SDK for JavaScript in their projects. With the earlier V2 of the SDK, web
developers would have to load the full SDK into the browser, referencing an
SDK image hosted at https://sdk.amazonaws.com/js/.

With V3, it's possible to bundle just the required V3 client modules and
