## About Boto

You can access DynamoDB from Python by using the official AWS SDK for Python, commonly
referred to as **Boto3**. The name Boto (pronounced
boh-toh) comes from a freshwater dolphin native to the Amazon River. The Boto3 library
is the library’s third major version, first released in 2015. The Boto3 library is quite
large, as it supports all AWS services, not just DynamoDB. This orientation targets only
the parts of Boto3 relevant to DynamoDB.

Boto is maintained and published by AWS as open-source project hosted on GitHub.
It’s split into two packages: [Botocore](https://github.com/boto/botocore "https://github.com/boto/botocore") and [Boto3](https://github.com/boto/boto3 "https://github.com/boto/boto3").

- **Botocore** provides the low-level
  functionality. In Botocore you’ll find the client, session, credentials, config,
  and exception classes.
- **Boto3** builds on top of Botocore. It offers a
  higher-level, more Pythonic interface. Specifically, it exposes a DynamoDB table as
  a Resource and offers a simpler, more elegant interface compared to the
  lower-level, service-oriented client interface.

Because these projects are hosted on GitHub, you can view the source code, track open
issues, or submit your own issues.

## Using the Boto documentation

Get started with the Boto documentation with the following resources:

- Begin with the [Quickstart section](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/guide/quickstart.html "https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/guide/quickstart.html") that provides a solid starting point for the
  package installation. Go there for instructions on getting Boto3 installed if
  it’s not already (Boto3 is often automatically available within AWS services
  such as AWS Lambda).
- After that, focus on the documentation’s [DynamoDB guide](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/guide/dynamodb.html "https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/guide/dynamodb.html"). It shows you how to perform the basic DynamoDB
  activities: create and delete a table, manipulate items, run batch operations,
  run a query, and perform a scan. Its examples use the **resource** interface. When you see
  `boto3.resource('dynamodb')` that indicates you’re using the
  higher-level **resource** interface.
- After the guide, you can review the [DynamoDB reference](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/reference/services/dynamodb.html "https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/reference/services/dynamodb.html"). This landing page provides an exhaustive list of
  the classes and methods available to you. At the top, you’ll see the
  `DynamoDB.Client` class. This provides low-level access to all
  the control-plane and data-plane operations. At the bottom, look at the
  `DynamoDB.ServiceResource` class. This is the higher-level
  Pythonic interface. With it you can create a table, do batch operations across
  tables, or obtain a `DynamoDB.ServiceResource.Table` instance for
  table-specific actions.

## Understanding the client and

resource abstraction layers

The two interfaces you'll be working with are the **client** interface and the **resource**
interface.

- The low-level **client** interface provides a
  1-to-1 mapping to the underlying service API. Every API offered by DynamoDB is
  available through the client. This means the client interface can provide
  complete functionality, but it's often more verbose and complex to use.
- The higher-level **resource** interface does not
  provide a 1-to-1 mapping of the underlying service API. However, it provides
  methods that make it more convenient for you to access the service such as
  `batch_writer`.

Here’s an example of inserting an item using the client interface. Notice how all
values are passed as a map with the key indicating their type ('S' for string, 'N' for
number) and their value as a string. This is known as DynamoDB JSON format.

```
import boto3

dynamodb = boto3.client('dynamodb')

dynamodb.put_item(
    TableName='YourTableName',
    Item={
        'pk': {'S': 'id#1'},
        'sk': {'S': 'cart#123'},
        'name': {'S': 'SomeName'},
        'inventory': {'N': '500'},
        # ... more attributes ...
    }
)

```

Here's the same `PutItem` operation using the resource interface. The data
typing is implicit:

```
import boto3

dynamodb = boto3.resource('dynamodb')

table = dynamodb.Table('YourTableName')

table.put_item(
    Item={
        'pk': 'id#1',
        'sk': 'cart#123',
        'name': 'SomeName',
        'inventory': 500,
        # ... more attributes ...
    }
)


```

If needed, you can convert between regular JSON and DynamoDB JSON using the
`TypeSerializer` and `TypeDeserializer` classes provided with
boto3:

```
def dynamo_to_python(dynamo_object: dict) -> dict:
    deserializer = TypeDeserializer()
    return {
        k: deserializer.deserialize(v)
        for k, v in dynamo_object.items()
    }

def python_to_dynamo(python_object: dict) -> dict:
    serializer = TypeSerializer()
    return {
        k: serializer.serialize(v)
        for k, v in python_object.items()
    }

```

Here is how to perform a query using the client interface. It expresses the query as a
JSON construct. It uses a `KeyConditionExpression` string which requires
variable substitution to handle any potential keyword conflicts:

```
import boto3

client = boto3.client('dynamodb')

# Construct the query
response = client.query(
    TableName='YourTableName',
    KeyConditionExpression='pk = :pk_val AND begins_with(sk, :sk_val)',
    FilterExpression='#name = :name_val',
    ExpressionAttributeValues={
        ':pk_val': {'S': 'id#1'},
        ':sk_val': {'S': 'cart#'},
        ':name_val': {'S': 'SomeName'},
    },
    ExpressionAttributeNames={
        '#name': 'name',
    }
)

```

The same query operation using the resource interface can be shortened and
simplified:

```
import boto3
from boto3.dynamodb.conditions import Key, Attr

dynamodb = boto3.resource('dynamodb')
table = dynamodb.Table('YourTableName')

response = table.query(
    KeyConditionExpression=Key('pk').eq('id#1') & Key('sk').begins_with('cart#'),
    FilterExpression=Attr('name').eq('SomeName')
)

```

As a final example, imagine you want to get the approximate size of a table (which is
metadata kept on the table that is updated about every 6 hours). With the client
interface, you do a `describe_table()` operation and pull the answer from the
JSON structure returned:

```
import boto3

dynamodb = boto3.client('dynamodb')

response = dynamodb.describe_table(TableName='YourTableName')
size = response['Table']['TableSizeBytes']


```

With the resource interface, the table performs the describe operation implicitly and
presents the data directly as an attribute:

```
import boto3

dynamodb = boto3.resource('dynamodb')

table = dynamodb.Table('YourTableName')
size = table.table_size_bytes

```

###### Note

When considering whether to develop using the client or resource interface, be
aware that new features will not be added to the resource interface per the [resource documentation](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/guide/resources.html "https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/guide/resources.html"): “The AWS Python SDK team does not intend to
add new features to the resources interface in boto3. Existing interfaces will
continue to operate during boto3’s lifecycle. Customers can find access to newer
service features through the client interface.”

## Using the table resource

batch_writer

One convenience available only with the higher-level table resource is the
`batch_writer`. DynamoDB supports batch write operations allowing up to 25
put or delete operations in one network request. Batching like this improves efficiency
by minimizing network round trips.

With the low-level client library, you use the `client.batch_write_item()`
operation to run batches. You must manually split your work into batches of 25. After
each operation, you also have to request to receive a list of unprocessed items (some of
the write operations may succeed while others could fail). You then have to pass those
unprocessed items again into a later `batch_write_item()` operation. There's
a significant amount of boilerplate code.

The [Table.batch_writer](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/reference/services/dynamodb/table/batch_writer.html "https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/reference/services/dynamodb/table/batch_writer.html") method creates a context manager for writing objects in
a batch. It presents an interface where it seems as if you're writing items one at a
time, but internally it's buffering and sending the items in batches. It also handles
unprocessed item retries implicitly.

```
dynamodb = boto3.resource('dynamodb')

table = dynamodb.Table('YourTableName')

movies = # long list of movies in {'pk': 'val', 'sk': 'val', etc} format
with table.batch_writer() as writer:
    for movie in movies:
        writer.put_item(Item=movie)

```

## Additional code examples that

explore the client and resource layers

You can also refer to the following code sample repositories that explore usage of the various functions, using both client and resource:

- [Official
  AWS single-action code examples.](../../../code-library/latest/ug/python_3_dynamodb_code_examples.md "../../../code-library/latest/ug/python_3_dynamodb_code_examples.md")
- [Official AWS scenario-oriented code examples.](https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/tree/main/python "https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/tree/main/python")
- [Community-maintained single-action code examples.](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-dynamodb-examples/tree/master/examples/SDK/python "https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-dynamodb-examples/tree/master/examples/SDK/python")

## Understanding how the Client

and Resource objects interact with sessions and threads

The Resource object is not thread safe and should not be shared across threads or
processes. Refer to the [guide on Resource](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/guide/resources.html#multithreading-or-multiprocessing-with-resources "https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/guide/resources.html#multithreading-or-multiprocessing-with-resources") for more details.

The Client object, in contrast, is generally thread safe, except for specific advanced
features. Refer to the [guide on Clients](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/guide/clients.html#multithreading-or-multiprocessing-with-clients "https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/guide/clients.html#multithreading-or-multiprocessing-with-clients") for more details.

The Session object is not thread safe. So, each time you make a Client or Resource in
a multi-threaded environment you should create a new Session first and then make the
Client or Resource from the Session. Refer to the [guide on Sessions](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/guide/session.html#multithreading-or-multiprocessing-with-sessions "https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/guide/session.html#multithreading-or-multiprocessing-with-sessions") for more details.

When you call the `boto3.resource()`, you’re implicitly using the default
Session. This is convenient for writing single-threaded code. When writing
multi-threaded code, you’ll want to first construct a new Session for each thread and
then retrieve the resource from that Session:

```
# Explicitly create a new Session for this thread
session = boto3.Session()
dynamodb = session.resource('dynamodb')

```

## Customizing the Config object

When constructing a Client or Resource object, you can pass optional named parameters
to customize behavior. The parameter named `config` unlocks a variety of
functionality. It’s an instance of `botocore.client.Config` and the [reference documentation for Config](https://botocore.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/reference/config.html "https://botocore.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/reference/config.html") shows everything it exposes for you to
control. The [guide to Configuration](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/guide/configuration.html "https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/guide/configuration.html") provides a good overview.

###### Note

You can modify many of these behavioral settings at the Session level, within the
AWS configuration file, or as environment variables.

**Config for timeouts**

One use of a custom config is to adjust networking behaviors:

- **connect_timeout (float or int)** – The time in
  seconds till a timeout exception is thrown when attempting to make a connection.
  The default is 60 seconds.
- **read_timeout (float or int)** – The time in
  seconds till a timeout exception is thrown when attempting to read from a
  connection. The default is 60 seconds.

Timeouts of 60 seconds are excessive for DynamoDB. It means a transient network glitch
will cause a minute’s delay for the client before it can try again. The following code
shortens the timeouts to a second:

```
import boto3
from botocore.config import Config

my_config = Config(
   connect_timeout = 1.0,
   read_timeout = 1.0
)
dynamodb = boto3.resource('dynamodb', config=my_config)

```

For more discussion about timeouts, see [Tuning AWS Java SDK HTTP request settings for latency-aware DynamoDB
applications](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/database/tuning-aws-java-sdk-http-request-settings-for-latency-aware-amazon-dynamodb-applications/ "https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/database/tuning-aws-java-sdk-http-request-settings-for-latency-aware-amazon-dynamodb-applications/"). Note the Java SDK has more timeout configurations than
Python.

**Config for keep-alive**

If you're using botocore 1.27.84 or later, you can also control **TCP Keep-Alive**:

- **tcp_keepalive** (bool) - Enables the TCP
  Keep-Alive socket option used when creating new connections if set to
  `True` ( defaults to `False`). This is only available
  starting with botocore 1.27.84.

Setting TCP Keep-Alive to `True` can reduce average latencies. Here's
sample code that conditionally sets TCP Keep-Alive to true when you have the right
botocore version:

```
import botocore
import boto3
from botocore.config import Config
from distutils.version import LooseVersion

required_version = "1.27.84"
current_version = botocore.__version__

my_config = Config(
   connect_timeout = 0.5,
   read_timeout = 0.5
)
if LooseVersion(current_version) > LooseVersion(required_version):
    my_config = my_config.merge(Config(tcp_keepalive = True))

dynamodb = boto3.resource('dynamodb', config=my_config)

```

###### Note

TCP Keep-Alive is different than HTTP Keep-Alive. With TCP Keep-Alive, small
packets are sent by the underlying operating system over the socket connection to
keep the connection alive and immediately detect any drops. With HTTP Keep-Alive,
the web connection built on the underlying socket gets reused. HTTP Keep-Alive is
always enabled with boto3.

There's a limit to how long an idle connection can be kept alive. Consider sending
periodic requests (say every minute) if you have an idle connection but want the next
request to use an already-established connection.

**Config for retries**

The config also accepts a dictionary called **retries**
where you can specify your desired retry behavior. Retries happen within the SDK when
the SDK receives an error and the error is of a transient type. If an error is retried
internally (and a retry eventually produces a successful response), there's no error
seen from the calling code's perspective, just a slightly elevated latency. Here are the
values you can specify:

- **max_attempts** – An integer representing the
  maximum number of retry attempts that will be made on a single request. For
  example, setting this value to 2 will result in the request being retried at
  most two times after the initial request. Setting this value to 0 will result in
  no retries ever being attempted after the initial request.
- **total_max_attempts** – An integer representing
  the maximum number of total attempts that will be made on a single request. This
  includes the initial request, so a value of 1 indicates that no requests will be
  retried. If `total_max_attempts` and `max_attempts` are
  both provided, `total_max_attempts` takes precedence.
  `total_max_attempts` is preferred over `max_attempts`
  because it maps to the `AWS_MAX_ATTEMPTS` environment variable and
  the `max_attempts` config file value.
- **mode** – A string representing the type of
  retry mode botocore should use. Valid values are:
  - **legacy** – The default mode. Waits 50ms
    the first retry, then uses exponential backoff with a base factor of 2.
    For DynamoDB, it performs up to 10 total max attempts (unless overridden
    with the above).

  ###### Note

  With exponential backoff, the last attempt will wait almost 13
  seconds.
  - **standard** – Named standard because
    it’s more consistent with other AWS SDKs. Waits a random time from 0ms
    to 1,000ms for the first retry. If another retry is necessary, it picks
    another random time from 0ms to 1,000ms and multiplies it by 2. If an
    additional retry is necessary, it does the same random pick multiplied
    by 4, and so on. Each wait is capped at 20 seconds. This mode will
    perform retries on more detected failure conditions than the
    `legacy` mode. For DynamoDB, it performs up to 3 total max
    attempts (unless overridden with the above).
  - **adaptive** - An experimental retry mode
    that includes all the functionality of standard mode but adds automatic
    client-side throttling. With adaptive rate limiting, SDKs can slow down
    the rate at which requests are sent to better accommodate the capacity
    of AWS services. This is a provisional mode whose behavior might
    change.

An expanded definition of these retry modes can be found in the [guide to retries](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/guide/retries.html "https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/guide/retries.html") as well as in the [Retry behavior topic in the
SDK reference](../../../sdkref/latest/guide/feature-retry-behavior.md "../../../sdkref/latest/guide/feature-retry-behavior.md").

Here’s an example that explicitly uses the `legacy` retry policy with a
maximum of 3 total requests (2 retries):

```
import boto3
from botocore.config import Config

my_config = Config(
   connect_timeout = 1.0,
   read_timeout = 1.0,
   retries = {
     'mode': 'legacy',
     'total_max_attempts': 3
   }
)
dynamodb = boto3.resource('dynamodb', config=my_config)

```

Because DynamoDB is a highly-available, low-latency system, you may want to be more
aggressive with the speed of retries than the built-in retry policies allow. You can
implement your own retry policy by setting the max attempts to 0, catching the
exceptions yourself, and retrying as appropriate from your own code instead of relying
on boto3 to do implicit retries.

If you manage your own retry policy, you'll want to differentiate between throttles
and errors:

- A **throttle** (indicated by a
  `ProvisionedThroughputExceededException` or
  `ThrottlingException`) indicates a healthy service that's
  informing you that you've exceeded your read or write capacity on a DynamoDB table
  or partition. Every millisecond that passes, a bit more read or write capacity
  is made available, so you can retry quickly (such as every 50ms) to attempt to
  access that newly released capacity. With throttles, you don't especially need
  exponential backoff because throttles are lightweight for DynamoDB to return and
  incur no per-request charge to you. Exponential backoff assigns longer delays to
  client threads that have already waited the longest, which statistically extends
  the p50 and p99 outward.
- An **error** (indicated by an
  `InternalServerError` or a `ServiceUnavailable`, among
  others) indicates a transient issue with the service. This can be for the whole
  table or possibly just the partition you're reading from or writing to. With
  errors, you can pause longer before retries (such as 250ms or 500ms) and use
  jitter to stagger the retries.

**Config for max pool connections**

Lastly, the config lets you control the connection pool size:

- **max_pool_connections (int)** – The maximum
  number of connections to keep in a connection pool. If this value is not set,
  the default value of 10 is used.

This option controls the maximum number of HTTP connections to keep pooled for reuse.
A different pool is kept per Session. If you anticipate more than 10 threads going
against clients or resources built off the same Session, you should consider raising
this, so threads don't have to wait on other threads using a pooled connection.

```
import boto3
from botocore.config import Config

my_config = Config(
   max_pool_connections = 20
)

# Setup a single session holding up to 20 pooled connections
session = boto3.Session(my_config)

# Create up to 20 resources against that session for handing to threads
# Notice the single-threaded access to the Session and each Resource
resource1 = session.resource('dynamodb')
resource2 = session.resource('dynamodb')
# etc

```

## Error handling

AWS service exceptions aren’t all statically defined in Boto3. This is because
errors and exceptions from AWS services vary widely and are subject to change. Boto3
wraps all service exceptions as a `ClientError` and exposes the details as
structured JSON. For example, an error response might be structured like this:

```
{
    'Error': {
        'Code': 'SomeServiceException',
        'Message': 'Details/context around the exception or error'
    },
    'ResponseMetadata': {
        'RequestId': '1234567890ABCDEF',
        'HostId': 'host ID data will appear here as a hash',
        'HTTPStatusCode': 400,
        'HTTPHeaders': {'header metadata key/values will appear here'},
        'RetryAttempts': 0
    }
}

```

The following code catches any `ClientError` exceptions and looks at the
string value of the `Code` within the `Error` to determine what
action to take:

```
import botocore
import boto3

dynamodb = boto3.client('dynamodb')

try:
    response = dynamodb.put_item(...)

except botocore.exceptions.ClientError as err:
    print('Error Code: {}'.format(err.response['Error']['Code']))
    print('Error Message: {}'.format(err.response['Error']['Message']))
    print('Http Code: {}'.format(err.response['ResponseMetadata']['HTTPStatusCode']))
    print('Request ID: {}'.format(err.response['ResponseMetadata']['RequestId']))

    if err.response['Error']['Code'] in ('ProvisionedThroughputExceededException', 'ThrottlingException'):
        print("Received a throttle")
    elif err.response['Error']['Code'] == 'InternalServerError':
        print("Received a server error")
    else:
        raise err

```

Some (but not all) exception codes have been materialized as top-level classes. You
can choose to handle these directly. When using the Client interface, these exceptions
are dynamically populated on your client and you catch these exceptions using your
client instance, like this:

```
except ddb_client.exceptions.ProvisionedThroughputExceededException:
```

When using the Resource interface, you have to use `.meta.client` to
traverse from the resource to the underlying Client to access the exceptions, like
this:

```
except ddb_resource.meta.client.exceptions.ProvisionedThroughputExceededException:
```

To review the list of materialized exception types, you can generate the list
dynamically:

```
ddb = boto3.client("dynamodb")
print([e for e in dir(ddb.exceptions) if e.endswith('Exception') or e.endswith('Error')])

```

When doing a write operation with a condition expression, you can request that if the
expression fails the value of the item should be returned in the error response.

```
try:
    response = table.put_item(
        Item=item,
        ConditionExpression='attribute_not_exists(pk)',
        ReturnValuesOnConditionCheckFailure='ALL_OLD'
    )
except table.meta.client.exceptions.ConditionalCheckFailedException as e:
    print('Item already exists:', e.response['Item'])

```

## Logging

The boto3 library integrates with Python's built-in logging module for tracking what
happens during a session. To control logging levels, you can configure the logging
module:

```
import logging

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)

```

This configures the root logger to log `INFO` and above level messages.
Logging messages which are less severe than level will be ignored. Logging levels
include `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`,
and `CRITICAL`. The default is `WARNING`.

Loggers in boto3 are hierarchical. The library uses a few different loggers, each
corresponding to different parts of the library. You can separately control the behavior
of each:

- **boto3**: The main logger for the boto3
  module.
- **botocore**: The main logger for the botocore
  package.
- **botocore.auth**: Used for logging AWS
  signature creation for requests.
- **botocore.credentials**: Used for logging the
  process of credential fetching and refresh.
- **botocore.endpoint**: Used for logging request
  creation before it's sent over the network.
- **botocore.hooks**: Used for logging events
  triggered in the library.
- **botocore.loaders**: Used for logging when parts
  of AWS service models are loaded.
- **botocore.parsers**: Used for logging AWS
  service responses before they're parsed.
- **botocore.retryhandler**: Used for logging the
  processing of AWS service request retries (legacy mode).
- **botocore.retries.standard**: Used for logging
  the processing of AWS service request retries (standard or adaptive
  mode).
- **botocore.utils**: Used for logging
  miscellaneous activities in the library.
- **botocore.waiter**: Used for logging the
  functionality of waiters, which poll an AWS service until a certain state is
  reached.

Other libraries log as well. Internally, boto3 uses the third party urllib3 for HTTP
connection handling. When latency is important, you can watch its logs to ensure your
pool is being well utilized by seeing when urllib3 establishes a new connection or
closes an idle one down.

- **urllib3.connectionpool:** Use for logging
  connection pool handling events.

The following code snippet sets most logging to `INFO` with
`DEBUG` logging for endpoint and connection pool activity:

```
import logging

logging.getLogger('boto3').setLevel(logging.INFO)
logging.getLogger('botocore').setLevel(logging.INFO)
logging.getLogger('botocore.endpoint').setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
logging.getLogger('urllib3.connectionpool').setLevel(logging.DEBUG)

```

## Event hooks

Botocore emits events during various parts of its execution. You can register handlers
for these events so that whenever an event is emitted, your handler will be called. This
lets you extend the behavior of botocore without having to modify the internals.

For instance, let's say you want to keep track of every time a `PutItem`
operation is called on any DynamoDB table in your application. You might register on the
`'provide-client-params.dynamodb.PutItem'` event to catch and log every
time a `PutItem` operation is invoked on the associated Session. Here's an
example:

```
import boto3
import botocore
import logging

def log_put_params(params, **kwargs):
    if 'TableName' in params and 'Item' in params:
        logging.info(f"PutItem on table {params['TableName']}: {params['Item']}")

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)

session = boto3.Session()
event_system = session.events

# Register our interest in hooking in when the parameters are provided to PutItem
event_system.register('provide-client-params.dynamodb.PutItem', log_put_params)

# Now, every time you use this session to put an item in DynamoDB,
# it will log the table name and item data.
dynamodb = session.resource('dynamodb')
table = dynamodb.Table('YourTableName')
table.put_item(
    Item={
        'pk': '123',
        'sk': 'cart#123',
        'item_data': 'YourItemData',
        # ... more attributes ...
    }
)

```

Within the handler, you can even manipulate the params programmatically to change
behavior:

```
params['TableName'] = "NewTableName"
```

For more information on events, see the [botocore documentation on events](https://botocore.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/topics/events.html "https://botocore.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/topics/events.html") and the [boto3 documentation on events](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/guide/events.html "https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/guide/events.html").

## Pagination and the Paginator

Some requests, such as Query and Scan, limit the size of data returned on a single
request and require you to make repeated requests to pull subsequent pages.

You can control the maximum number of items to be read for each page with the
`limit` parameter. For example, if you want the last 10 items, you can
use `limit` to retrieve only the last 10. Note the limit is how much should
be read from the table before any filtering is applied. There's no way to specify you
want exactly 10 after filtering; you can only control the pre-filtered count and check
client-side when you've actually retrieved 10. Regardless of the limit, every response
always has a maximum size of 1 MB.

If the response includes a `LastEvaluatedKey`, it indicates the response
ended because it hit a count or size limit. The key is the last key evaluated for the
response. You can retrieve this `LastEvaluatedKey` and pass it to a follow-up
call as `ExclusiveStartKey` to read the next chunk from that starting point.
When there's no `LastEvaluatedKey` returned that, means there are no more
items matching the Query or Scan.

Here's a simple example (using the Resource interface, but the Client interface has
the same pattern) that reads at most 100 items per page and loops until all items have
been read.

```
import boto3

dynamodb = boto3.resource('dynamodb')
table = dynamodb.Table('YourTableName')

query_params = {
    'KeyConditionExpression': Key('pk').eq('123') & Key('sk').gt(1000),
    'Limit': 100
}

while True:
    response = table.query(**query_params)

    # Process the items however you like
    for item in response['Items']:
        print(item)

    # No LastEvaluatedKey means no more items to retrieve
    if 'LastEvaluatedKey' not in response:
        break

    # If there are possibly more items, update the start key for the next page
    query_params['ExclusiveStartKey'] = response['LastEvaluatedKey']

```

For convenience, boto3 can do this for you with Paginators. However, it only works
with the Client interface. Here's the code rewritten to use Paginators:

```
import boto3

dynamodb = boto3.client('dynamodb')

paginator = dynamodb.get_paginator('query')

query_params = {
    'TableName': 'YourTableName',
    'KeyConditionExpression': 'pk = :pk_val AND sk > :sk_val',
    'ExpressionAttributeValues': {
        ':pk_val': {'S': '123'},
        ':sk_val': {'N': '1000'},
    },
    'Limit': 100
}

page_iterator = paginator.paginate(**query_params)

for page in page_iterator:
    # Process the items however you like
    for item in page['Items']:
        print(item)

```

For more information, see the [Guide on Paginators](https://botocore.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/topics/events.html "https://botocore.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/topics/events.html") and the [API reference for DynamoDB.Paginator.Query](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/reference/services/dynamodb/paginator/Query.html "https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/reference/services/dynamodb/paginator/Query.html").

###### Note

Paginators also have their own configuration settings named `MaxItems`,
`StartingToken`, and `PageSize`. For paginating with
DynamoDB, you should ignore these settings.

## Waiters

Waiters provide the ability to wait for something to complete before proceeding. At
present, they only support waiting for a table to be created or deleted. In the
background, the waiter operation does a check for you every 20 seconds up to 25 times.
You could do this yourself, but using a waiter is elegant when writing
automation.

This code shows how to wait for a particular table to have been created:

```
# Create a table, wait until it exists, and print its ARN
response = client.create_table(...)
waiter = client.get_waiter('table_exists')
waiter.wait(TableName='YourTableName')
print('Table created:', response['TableDescription']['TableArn']

```

For more information, see the [Guide to Waiters](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/guide/clients.html#waiters "https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/guide/clients.html#waiters") and [Reference on Waiters](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/reference/services/dynamodb.html#waiters "https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/reference/services/dynamodb.html#waiters").
