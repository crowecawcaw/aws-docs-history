# Monitoring Oracle Database@AWS

Monitoring is an important part of maintaining the reliability, availability, and
performance of Oracle Database@AWS and your other AWS solutions. AWS provides the following monitoring
tools to watch Oracle Database@AWS, report when something is wrong, and take automatic actions when
appropriate:

- _Amazon CloudWatch_ monitors your AWS resources and and the applications you
  run on AWS in real time. You can collect and track metrics, create customized dashboards,
  and set alarms that notify you or take actions when a specified metric reaches a threshold
  that you specify. For example, you can have CloudWatch track CPU usage or other metrics of your
  Amazon EC2 instances and automatically launch new instances when needed. For more information,
  see the [Amazon CloudWatch User Guide](../../../AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring.md "../../../AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring.md").
- _Amazon CloudWatch Logs_ enables you to monitor, store, and access your log files
  from Amazon EC2 instances, CloudTrail, and other sources. CloudWatch Logs can monitor information in the log
  files and notify you when certain thresholds are met. You can also archive your log data in
  highly durable storage. For more information, see the [Amazon CloudWatch Logs User Guide](../../../AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs.md "../../../AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs.md").
- _Amazon EventBridge_ can be used to automate your AWS services and respond
  automatically to system events, such as application availability issues or resource changes.
  Events from AWS services are delivered to EventBridge in near real time. You can write simple
  rules to indicate which events are of interest to you and which automated actions to take
  when an event matches a rule. For more information, see [Amazon EventBridge User Guide](../../../eventbridge/latest/userguide.md "../../../eventbridge/latest/userguide.md").
- _AWS CloudTrail_ captures API calls and related events made by or on behalf
  of your AWS account and delivers the log files to an Amazon S3 bucket that you specify. You can
  identify which users and accounts called AWS, the source IP address from which the calls
  were made, and when the calls occurred. For more information, see the [AWS CloudTrail User Guide](../../../awscloudtrail/latest/userguide.md "../../../awscloudtrail/latest/userguide.md").
