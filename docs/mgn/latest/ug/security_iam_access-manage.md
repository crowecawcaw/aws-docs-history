# Managing access using policies

You control access in AWS by creating policies and attaching them to AWS identities or resources. A policy defines permissions when associated with an identity or resource. AWS evaluates these policies when a principal makes a request. Most policies are stored in AWS as JSON documents. For more information about JSON policy documents, see [Overview of JSON policies](../../../IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.md#access_policies-json "../../../IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.md#access_policies-json") in the _IAM User Guide_.

Using policies, administrators specify who has access to what by defining which **principal** can perform **actions** on what **resources**, and under what **conditions**.

By default, users and roles have no permissions. An IAM administrator creates IAM policies and adds them to roles, which users can then assume. IAM policies define permissions regardless of the method used to perform the operation.

## Identity-based

policies

Identity-based policies are JSON permissions policy documents that you can attach to an
identity, such as a user, role, or group. These policies control what actions that
identity can perform, on which resources, and under what conditions. To learn how to
create an identity-based policy, see [Define custom IAM permissions with customer managed policies](../../../IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_create.md "../../../IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_create.md") in the IAM User Guide.

Identity-based policies can be further categorized as inline policies or managed
policies. Inline policies are embedded directly into a single user, group, or role.
Managed policies are standalone policies that you can attach to multiple users, groups,
and roles in your AWS account. Managed policies include AWS managed policies and customer
managed policies. To learn how to choose between a managed policy or an inline policy,
see[Managed policies and inline policies](../../../IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_managed-vs-inline.md#choosing-managed-or-inline "../../../IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_managed-vs-inline.md#choosing-managed-or-inline") in the IAM User Guide.

## Resource-based

policies

Resource-based policies are JSON policy documents that you attach to a resource. Examples include IAM _role trust policies_ and Amazon S3 _bucket policies_. In services that support resource-based policies, service administrators can use them to control access to a specific resource. You must [specify a principal](../../../IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_elements_principal.md "../../../IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_elements_principal.md") in a resource-based policy.

Resource-based policies are inline policies that are located in that service. You can't use AWS managed policies from IAM in a resource-based policy.

## Access control lists (ACLs)

Access control lists (ACLs) control which principals (account members, users, or roles) have permissions to access a resource. ACLs are
similar to resource-based policies, although they do not use the JSON policy document format.

Amazon S3, AWS WAF, and Amazon VPC
are examples of services that support ACLs. To learn more about ACLs, see [Access control list (ACL)
overview](../../../AmazonS3/latest/userguide/acl-overview.md "../../../AmazonS3/latest/userguide/acl-overview.md") in the _Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide_.

## Other policy types

AWS supports additional policy types that can set the maximum permissions granted by more common policy types:

- **Permissions boundaries** – Set the maximum permissions that an identity-based policy can grant to an IAM entity. For more information, see [Permissions boundaries for IAM entities](../../../IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_boundaries.md "../../../IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_boundaries.md") in the _IAM User Guide_.
- **Service control policies (SCPs)** – Specify the maximum permissions for an organization or organizational unit in AWS Organizations. For more information, see [Service control policies](../../../organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_policies_scps.md "../../../organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_policies_scps.md") in the _AWS Organizations User Guide_.
- **Resource control policies (RCPs)** – Set the maximum available permissions for resources in your accounts. For more information, see [Resource control policies (RCPs)](../../../organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_policies_rcps.md "../../../organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_policies_rcps.md") in the _AWS Organizations User Guide_.
- **Session policies** – Advanced policies passed as a parameter when creating a temporary session for a role or federated user. For more information, see [Session policies](../../../IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.md#policies_session "../../../IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.md#policies_session") in the _IAM User Guide_.

## Multiple policy

types

When multiple types of policies apply to a request, the resulting permissions are more complicated to understand. To learn how AWS determines whether to allow a request when multiple policy types are involved, see [Policy evaluation logic](../../../IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_evaluation-logic.md "../../../IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_evaluation-logic.md") in the _IAM User Guide_.
