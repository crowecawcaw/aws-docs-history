# Amazon OpenSearch Serverless

Amazon OpenSearch Serverless is an on-demand, auto-scaling configuration for Amazon OpenSearch Service. Unlike provisioned
OpenSearch domains, which require manual capacity management, an OpenSearch Serverless collection
automatically scales compute resources based on your application's needs.

OpenSearch Serverless offers a cost-effective solution for workloads that are infrequent,
intermittent, or unpredictable. It optimizes costs by automatically scaling compute capacity
based on your application's usage. Serverless collections use the same high-capacity,
distributed, and highly available storage volume as provisioned OpenSearch Service domains.

OpenSearch Serverless collections are always encrypted. You can choose the encryption key, but you can't
disable encryption. For more information, see [Encryption in Amazon OpenSearch Serverless](serverless-encryption.md "serverless-encryption.md")

## Benefits

OpenSearch Serverless has the following benefits:

- **Simpler than provisioned** – OpenSearch Serverless
  removes much of the complexity of managing OpenSearch clusters and capacity. It
  automatically sizes and tunes your clusters, and takes care of shard and index
  lifecycle management. It also manages service software updates and OpenSearch
  version upgrades. All updates and upgrades are non-disruptive.
- **Cost-effective** – When you use OpenSearch Serverless,
  you only pay for the resources that you consume. This removes the need for
  upfront provisioning and overprovisioning for peak workloads.
- **Highly available** – OpenSearch Serverless supports
  production workloads with redundancy to protect against Availability Zone
  outages and infrastructure failures.
- **Scalable** – OpenSearch Serverless automatically scales
  resources to maintain consistently fast data ingestion rates and query response
  times.
