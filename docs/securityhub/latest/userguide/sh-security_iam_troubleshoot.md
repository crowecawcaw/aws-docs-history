Use the following information to help you diagnose and fix common issues that you might encounter when working with AWS Security Hub and IAM.

## I am not authorized to perform an action in Security Hub
<a name="sh-security_iam_troubleshoot-no-permissions"></a>

If the AWS Management Console tells you that you are not authorized to perform an action, then you must contact your administrator for assistance. Your administrator is the person that provided you with your sign-in credentials.

The following example error occurs when the user `mateojackson` tries to use the console to view details about a {{widget}} but does not have `securityhub:{{GetWidget}}` permissions.

```
User: arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/mateojackson is not authorized to perform: securityhub:{{GetWidget}} on resource: {{my-example-widget}}
```

In this case, Mateo asks his administrator to update his policies to allow him to access the `{{my-example-widget}}` resource using the `securityhub:{{GetWidget}}` action.

## I am not authorized to perform iam:PassRole
<a name="sh-security_iam_troubleshoot-passrole"></a>

If you receive an error that you're not authorized to perform the `iam:PassRole` action, your policies must be updated to allow you to pass a role to Security Hub.

Some AWS services allow you to pass an existing role to that service instead of creating a new service role or service-linked role. To do this, you must have permissions to pass the role to the service.

The following example error occurs when an IAM user named `marymajor` tries to use the console to perform an action in Security Hub. However, the action requires the service to have permissions that are granted by a service role. Mary does not have permissions to pass the role to the service.

```
User: arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/marymajor is not authorized to perform: iam:PassRole
```

In this case, Mary's policies must be updated to allow her to perform the `iam:PassRole` action.

If you need help, contact your AWS administrator. Your administrator is the person who provided you with your sign-in credentials.

## I want programmatic access to Security Hub
<a name="sh-security_iam_troubleshoot-access-keys"></a>

Users need programmatic access if they want to interact with AWS outside of the AWS Management Console. The way to grant programmatic access depends on the type of user that's accessing AWS.

To grant users programmatic access, choose one of the following options.



| Which user needs programmatic access? | To | By | 
| --- | --- | --- | 
| IAM | (Recommended) Use console credentials as temporary credentials to sign programmatic requests to the AWS CLI, AWS SDKs, or AWS APIs. | Following the instructions for the interface that you want to use.+  For the AWS CLI, see [Login for AWS local development](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-sign-in.html) in the *AWS Command Line Interface User Guide*. <br />+  For AWS SDKs, see [Login for AWS local development](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdkref/latest/guide/access-login.html) in the *AWS SDKs and Tools Reference Guide*.  | 
| Workforce identity<br />(Users managed in IAM Identity Center) | Use temporary credentials to sign programmatic requests to the AWS CLI, AWS SDKs, or AWS APIs. | Following the instructions for the interface that you want to use.+  For the AWS CLI, see [Configuring the AWS CLI to use AWS IAM Identity Center](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-sso.html) in the *AWS Command Line Interface User Guide*. <br />+  For AWS SDKs, tools, and AWS APIs, see [IAM Identity Center authentication](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdkref/latest/guide/access-sso.html) in the *AWS SDKs and Tools Reference Guide*.  | 
| IAM | Use temporary credentials to sign programmatic requests to the AWS CLI, AWS SDKs, or AWS APIs. | Following the instructions in [Using temporary credentials with AWS resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_use-resources.html) in the IAM User Guide. | 
| IAM | (Not recommended)Use long-term credentials to sign programmatic requests to the AWS CLI, AWS SDKs, or AWS APIs. | Following the instructions for the interface that you want to use.+  For the AWS CLI, see [Authenticating using IAM user credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-authentication-user.html) in the *AWS Command Line Interface User Guide*. <br />+  For AWS SDKs and tools, see [Authenticate using long-term credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdkref/latest/guide/access-iam-users.html) in the *AWS SDKs and Tools Reference Guide*. <br />+  For AWS APIs, see [Managing access keys for IAM users](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_access-keys.html) in the *IAM User Guide*.  | 

## I'm an administrator and want to allow others to access Security Hub
<a name="sh-security_iam_troubleshoot-admin-delegate"></a>

To provide access, add permissions to your users, groups, or roles:
+ Users and groups in AWS IAM Identity Center:

  Create a permission set. Follow the instructions in [Create a permission set](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/howtocreatepermissionset.html) in the *AWS IAM Identity Center User Guide*.
+ Users managed in IAM through an identity provider:

  Create a role for identity federation. Follow the instructions in [Create a role for a third-party identity provider (federation)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-idp.html) in the *IAM User Guide*.
+ IAM users:
  + Create a role that your user can assume. Follow the instructions in [Create a role for an IAM user](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-user.html) in the *IAM User Guide*.
  + (Not recommended) Attach a policy directly to a user or add a user to a user group. Follow the instructions in [Adding permissions to a user (console)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_users_change-permissions.html#users_change_permissions-add-console) in the *IAM User Guide*.

## I want to allow people outside my AWS account to access my Security Hub resources
<a name="sh-security_iam_troubleshoot-cross-account-access"></a>

You can create a role that users in other accounts or people outside of your organization can use to access your resources. You can specify who is trusted to assume the role. For services that support resource-based policies or access control lists (ACLs), you can use those policies to grant people access to your resources.

To learn more, consult the following:
+ To learn whether Security Hub supports these features, see [How Security Hub works with IAM](security_iam_service-with-iam.md).
+ To learn how to provide access to your resources across AWS accounts that you own, see [Providing access to an IAM user in another AWS account that you own](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_common-scenarios_aws-accounts.html) in the *IAM User Guide*.
+ To learn how to provide access to your resources to third-party AWS accounts, see [Providing access to AWS accounts owned by third parties](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_common-scenarios_third-party.html) in the *IAM User Guide*.
+ To learn how to provide access through identity federation, see [Providing access to externally authenticated users (identity federation)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_common-scenarios_federated-users.html) in the *IAM User Guide*.
+ To learn the difference between using roles and resource-based policies for cross-account access, see [Cross account resource access in IAM](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies-cross-account-resource-access.html) in the *IAM User Guide*.
