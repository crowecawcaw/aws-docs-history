# Setting up an AWS account to use the Amazon Inspector CI/CD integration

To use the Amazon Inspector CI/CD integration, you must sign up for an AWS account.
The AWS account must have an IAM role that grants your CI/CD pipleline access to the Amazon Inspector Scan API.
Complete the tasks in the following topics to sign up for an AWS account, create an administrator user, and configure an IAM role for CI/CD integration.

###### Note

If you already signed up for an AWS account, you can skip to [Configure an IAM role for CI/CD
integration](#cicd-iam-role "#cicd-iam-role").

## Sign up for an AWS account

If you do not have an AWS account, complete the following steps to create one.

###### To sign up for an AWS account

1. Open [https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup "https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup").
2. Follow the online instructions.

Part of the sign-up procedure involves receiving a phone call or text message and entering
a verification code on the phone keypad.

When you sign up for an AWS account, an _AWS account root user_ is created. The root user has access to all AWS services
and resources in the account. As a security best practice, assign administrative access to a user, and use only the root user to perform [tasks that require root user access](../../../IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_root-user.md#root-user-tasks "../../../IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_root-user.md#root-user-tasks").

AWS sends you a confirmation email after the sign-up process is
complete. At any time, you can view your current account activity and manage your account by
going to [https://aws.amazon.com/](https://aws.amazon.com/ "https://aws.amazon.com/") and choosing **My
Account**.

## Create a user with administrative access

After you sign up for an AWS account, secure your AWS account root user, enable AWS IAM Identity Center, and create an administrative user so that you
don't use the root user for everyday tasks.

###### Secure your AWS account root user

1. Sign in to the [AWS Management Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ "https://console.aws.amazon.com/") as the account owner by choosing **Root user** and entering your AWS account email address. On the next page, enter your password.

For help signing in by using root user, see [Signing in as the root user](../../../signin/latest/userguide/console-sign-in-tutorials.md#introduction-to-root-user-sign-in-tutorial "../../../signin/latest/userguide/console-sign-in-tutorials.md#introduction-to-root-user-sign-in-tutorial") in the _AWS Sign-In User Guide_. 2. Turn on multi-factor authentication (MFA) for your root user.

For instructions, see [Enable a virtual MFA device for your AWS account root user (console)](../../../IAM/latest/UserGuide/enable-virt-mfa-for-root.md "../../../IAM/latest/UserGuide/enable-virt-mfa-for-root.md") in the _IAM User Guide_.

###### Create a user with administrative access

1. Enable IAM Identity Center.

For instructions, see [Enabling
AWS IAM Identity Center](../../../singlesignon/latest/userguide/get-set-up-for-idc.md "../../../singlesignon/latest/userguide/get-set-up-for-idc.md") in the
_AWS IAM Identity Center User Guide_. 2. In IAM Identity Center, grant administrative access to a user.

For a tutorial about using the IAM Identity Center directory as your identity source, see [Configure user access with the default IAM Identity Center directory](../../../singlesignon/latest/userguide/quick-start-default-idc.md "../../../singlesignon/latest/userguide/quick-start-default-idc.md") in the
_AWS IAM Identity Center User Guide_.

###### Sign in as the user with administrative access

- To sign in with your IAM Identity Center user, use the sign-in URL that was sent to your email address when you created the IAM Identity Center user.

For help signing in using an IAM Identity Center user, see [Signing in to the AWS access portal](../../../signin/latest/userguide/iam-id-center-sign-in-tutorial.md "../../../signin/latest/userguide/iam-id-center-sign-in-tutorial.md") in the _AWS Sign-In User Guide_.

###### Assign access to additional users

1. In IAM Identity Center, create a permission set that follows the best practice of applying least-privilege permissions.

For instructions, see [Create a permission set](../../../singlesignon/latest/userguide/get-started-create-a-permission-set.md "../../../singlesignon/latest/userguide/get-started-create-a-permission-set.md") in the _AWS IAM Identity Center User Guide_. 2. Assign users to a group, and then assign single sign-on access to the group.

For instructions, see [Add groups](../../../singlesignon/latest/userguide/addgroups.md "../../../singlesignon/latest/userguide/addgroups.md") in the _AWS IAM Identity Center User Guide_.

## Configure an IAM role for CI/CD

integration

To integrate Amazon Inspector scanning into your CI/CD pipeline you need to create an IAM
policy that allows access to the Amazon Inspector Scan API that scans the software bill of
materials (SBOMs). Then, you can attach that policy to an IAM role that your
account can assume to run the Amazon Inspector Scan API.

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the IAM console at
   [https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/ "https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/").
2. In the navigation pane of the IAM console,
   **Policies** and then choose **Create
   Policy**.
3. In **Policy Editor** select **JSON** and
   paste the following statement:

JSON

```
`{
 "Version":"2012-10-17",
 "Statement": [
 {
 "Sid": "VisualEditor0",
 "Effect": "Allow",
 "Action": "inspector-scan:ScanSbom",
 "Resource": "*"
 }
 ]
}`

```

4. Choose **Next**.
5. Give the policy a name, for example `InspectorCICDscan-policy`,
   and add an optional description, then choose **Create
   Policy**. This policy will be attached to the role you’ll
   create in the next steps.
6. In the navigation pane of the IAM console, select
   **Roles** and then select **Create New
   Role**.
7. For **Trusted entity type** choose **Custom trust
   policy** and paste the following policy:

JSON

```
`{
 "Version":"2012-10-17",
 "Statement": [
 {
 "Effect": "Allow",
 "Principal": {
 "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::`111122223333`:root"
 },
 "Action": "sts:AssumeRole",
 "Condition": {}
 }
 ]
}`

```

8. Choose **Next**.
9. In **Add permissions** search for and select the policy
   you created earlier, then choose **Next**.
10. Give the role a name, for example `InspectorCICDscan-role`, and
    add an optional description, then choose `Create Role`.
