**Introducing a new console experience for AWS WAF**

You can now use the updated experience to access AWS WAF functionality anywhere in the console.

# Bot Control example: Enabling targeted inspection level

For an enhanced level of protection, you can enable the targeted inspection level in your AWS WAF Bot Control managed rule group.

In the following example, machine learning features are enabled. You can opt out of this behavior by setting `EnableMachineLearning` to `false`.

```
{
  "Name": "AWS-AWSBotControl-Example",
  "Priority": 5,
  "Statement": {
    "ManagedRuleGroupStatement": {
      "VendorName": "AWS",
      "Name": "`AWSManagedRulesBotControlRuleSet`",
      "ManagedRuleGroupConfigs": [
        {
          "AWSManagedRulesBotControlRuleSet": {
            "InspectionLevel": "TARGETED",
            "EnableMachineLearning": true
          }
        }
      ],
      "RuleActionOverrides": [],
      "ExcludedRules": []
    },
    "VisibilityConfig": {
      "SampledRequestsEnabled": true,
      "CloudWatchMetricsEnabled": true,
      "MetricName": "AWS-AWSBotControl-Example"
    }
  }
}
```
