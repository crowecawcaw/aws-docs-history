# PutCompositeAlarm

Creates or updates a *composite alarm*. When you create a composite
 alarm, you specify a rule expression for the alarm that takes into account the alarm
 states of other alarms that you have created. The composite alarm goes into ALARM state
 only if all conditions of the rule are met.

The alarms specified in a composite alarm's rule expression can include metric alarms
 and other composite alarms. The rule expression of a composite alarm can include as many
 as 100 underlying alarms. Any single alarm can be included in the rule expressions of as
 many as 150 composite alarms.

Using composite alarms can reduce alarm noise. You can create multiple metric alarms,
 and also create a composite alarm and set up alerts only for the composite alarm. For
 example, you could create a composite alarm that goes into ALARM state only when more
 than one of the underlying metric alarms are in ALARM state.

Composite alarms can take the following actions:


* Notify Amazon SNS topics.
* Invoke Lambda functions.
* Create OpsItems in Systems Manager Ops Center.
* Create incidents in Systems Manager Incident Manager.
###### Note

It is possible to create a loop or cycle of composite alarms, where composite
 alarm A depends on composite alarm B, and composite alarm B also depends on
 composite alarm A. In this scenario, you can't delete any composite alarm that is
 part of the cycle because there is always still a composite alarm that depends on
 that alarm that you want to delete.

To get out of such a situation, you must break the cycle by changing the rule of
 one of the composite alarms in the cycle to remove a dependency that creates the
 cycle. The simplest change to make to break a cycle is to change the
 `AlarmRule` of one of the alarms to `false`. 

Additionally, the evaluation of composite alarms stops if CloudWatch detects a
 cycle in the evaluation path. 

When this operation creates an alarm, the alarm state is immediately set to
 `INSUFFICIENT_DATA`. The alarm is then evaluated and its state is set
 appropriately. Any actions associated with the new state are then executed. For a
 composite alarm, this initial time after creation is the only time that the alarm can be
 in `INSUFFICIENT_DATA` state.

When you update an existing alarm, its state is left unchanged, but the update
 completely overwrites the previous configuration of the alarm.

To use this operation, you must be signed on with the
 `cloudwatch:PutCompositeAlarm` permission that is scoped to
 `*`. You can't create a composite alarms if your
 `cloudwatch:PutCompositeAlarm` permission has a narrower scope.

If you are an IAM user, you must have
 `iam:CreateServiceLinkedRole` to create a composite alarm that has
 Systems Manager OpsItem actions.


## Request Parameters





**ActionsEnabled** 


Indicates whether actions should be executed during any changes to the alarm state of
 the composite alarm. The default is `TRUE`.


Type: Boolean

**ActionsSuppressor** 


 Actions will be suppressed if the suppressor alarm is in the `ALARM`
 state. `ActionsSuppressor` can be an AlarmName or an Amazon Resource Name
 (ARN) from an existing alarm.

 goes out of the `ALARM` state. After this time, the composite alarm performs
 its actions. 


###### Important


`ExtensionPeriod` is required only when `ActionsSuppressor` is
 specified.

 The maximum time in seconds that the composite alarm waits for the suppressor alarm
 to go into the `ALARM` state. After this time, the composite alarm performs
 its actions. 


###### Important


`WaitPeriod` is required only when `ActionsSuppressor` is
 specified. 


Type: Integer


Required: No




**AlarmActions** 


The actions to execute when this alarm transitions to the `ALARM` state
 from any other state. Each action is specified as an Amazon Resource Name
 (ARN).


Valid Values: ]



**Amazon SNS actions:**




`arn:aws:sns:*region*:*account-id*:*sns-topic-name*`




**Lambda actions:**




* Invoke the latest version of a Lambda function:
 `arn:aws:lambda:*region*:*account-id*:function:*function-name*`
* Invoke a specific version of a Lambda function:
 `arn:aws:lambda:*region*:*account-id*:function:*function-name*:*version-number*`
* Invoke a function by using an alias Lambda function:
 `arn:aws:lambda:*region*:*account-id*:function:*function-name*:*alias-name*`


**Systems Manager actions:**

**Start a Amazon Q Developer operational investigation**




`arn:aws:aiops:*region*:*account-id*:investigation-group:*investigation-group-id*`



Type: Array of strings


Array Members: Maximum number of 5 items.


Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1. Maximum length of 1024.


Required: No




**AlarmDescription** 


The description for the composite alarm.


Type: String


Length Constraints: Minimum length of 0. Maximum length of 1024.


Required: No




**AlarmName** 


The name for the composite alarm. This name must be unique within the
 Region.


Type: String


Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1. Maximum length of 255.


Required: Yes




**AlarmRule** 


An expression that specifies which other alarms are to be evaluated to determine this
 composite alarm's state. For each alarm that you reference, you designate a function
 that specifies whether that alarm needs to be in ALARM state, OK state, or
 INSUFFICIENT\_DATA state. You can use operators (AND, OR and NOT) to combine multiple
 functions in a single expression. You can use parenthesis to logically group the
 functions in your expression.


You can use either alarm names or ARNs to reference the other alarms that are to be
 evaluated.


Functions can include the following:



* `ALARM("*alarm-name* or
 *alarm-ARN*")` is TRUE if the named alarm is in
 ALARM state.
* `OK("*alarm-name* or
 *alarm-ARN*")` is TRUE if the named alarm is in OK
 state.
* `INSUFFICIENT_DATA("*alarm-name* or
 *alarm-ARN*")` is TRUE if the named alarm is in
 INSUFFICIENT\_DATA state.
* `TRUE` always evaluates to TRUE.
* `FALSE` always evaluates to FALSE.

TRUE and FALSE are useful for testing a complex `AlarmRule` structure, and
 for testing your alarm actions.


Alarm names specified in `AlarmRule` can be surrounded with double-quotes
 ("), but do not have to be.


The following are some examples of `AlarmRule`:



* `ALARM(CPUUtilizationTooHigh) AND ALARM(DiskReadOpsTooHigh)`
 specifies that the composite alarm goes into ALARM state only if both
 CPUUtilizationTooHigh and DiskReadOpsTooHigh alarms are in ALARM state.
* `ALARM(CPUUtilizationTooHigh) AND NOT ALARM(DeploymentInProgress)`
 specifies that the alarm goes to ALARM state if CPUUtilizationTooHigh is in
 ALARM state and DeploymentInProgress is not in ALARM state. This example reduces
 alarm noise during a known deployment window.
* `(ALARM(CPUUtilizationTooHigh) OR ALARM(DiskReadOpsTooHigh)) AND
 OK(NetworkOutTooHigh)` goes into ALARM state if CPUUtilizationTooHigh
 OR DiskReadOpsTooHigh is in ALARM state, and if NetworkOutTooHigh is in OK
 state. This provides another example of using a composite alarm to prevent
 noise. This rule ensures that you are not notified with an alarm action on high
 CPU or disk usage if a known network problem is also occurring.

The `AlarmRule` can specify as many as 100 "children" alarms. The
 `AlarmRule` expression can have as many as 500 elements. Elements are
 child alarms, TRUE or FALSE statements, and parentheses.


Type: String


Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1. Maximum length of 10240.


Required: Yes
