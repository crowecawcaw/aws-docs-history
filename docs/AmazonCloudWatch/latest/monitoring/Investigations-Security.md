##  Default CloudWatch investigations permissions,
 retention, and encryption


When you run investigations using default settings without additional configuration in
 your account the investigation uses the permissions available to your current console
 session and only accesses telemetry data using Read-only permissions. No investigation
 group IAM role configuration or permission policy is needed. However, that means the
 investigation's access to data is limited by the signed in user's permissions.


This investigation is only available to the same user that started the investigation.
 The investigation is available to view only for a 24 hour period, after which the
 investigation is deleted with no recovery option available. 


The investigation data is encrypted at rest with an AWS owned key. You can't view or
 manage AWS owned keys, and you can't use them for other purposes or audit their use.
 However, you don't have to take any action or change any settings to use these keys. For
 more information, see [AWS KMS keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html").


## User permissions for your CloudWatch investigations group


AWS has created three managed IAM policies that you can use for your users who
 will be working with your CloudWatch investigations group.



* [AIOpsConsoleAdminPolicy](managed-policies-cloudwatch.md#managed-policies-QInvestigations-AIOpsConsoleAdminPolicy "managed-policies-cloudwatch.md#managed-policies-QInvestigations-AIOpsConsoleAdminPolicy")– grants an administrator the ability
 to set up CloudWatch investigations in the account, access to CloudWatch investigations actions, the management of trusted
 identity propagation, and the management of integration with IAM Identity Center and
 organizational access.
* [AIOpsOperatorAccess](managed-policies-cloudwatch.md#managed-policies-QInvestigations-AIOpsOperatorAccess "managed-policies-cloudwatch.md#managed-policies-QInvestigations-AIOpsOperatorAccess")– grants a user access to investigation
 actions including starting an investigation. It also grants additional
 permissions that are necessary for accessing investigation events.
* [AIOpsReadOnlyAccess](managed-policies-cloudwatch.md#managed-policies-QInvestigations-AIOpsReadOnlyAccess "managed-policies-cloudwatch.md#managed-policies-QInvestigations-AIOpsReadOnlyAccess")– grants read-only permissions for CloudWatch investigations
 and other related services.

We recommend that you use three IAM principals, granting one of them the **AIOpsConsoleAdminPolicy** IAM policy, granting another the
 **AIOpsOperatorAccess** policy, and granting the third
 the **AIOpsReadOnlyAccess** policy. These principals could
 be either IAM roles (recommended) or IAM users. Then your users who work with CloudWatch investigations
 would sign on using one of these principals.


### Permissions for incident report
 generation


Incident report generation requires additional permissions to allow the AI to
 collect events, facts, and then create reports.


Users with **AIOpsConsoleAdminPolicy** can generate,
 edit, and copy incident reports. By default, your investigation group is assigned
 the **AIOpsAssistantPolicy** to give it access to
 resource. However, it does not have the permissions required to generate an
 investigation report. To give permissions to your investigation group to collate the
 investigation data into an incident report you must add a policy similar to the
 following example that includes additional permissions or add the additional actions
 as an inline policy to the group: 



```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",		 	 	 
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "IncidentReportOperations",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "aiops:GetInvestigation",
                "aiops:ListInvestigationEvents",
                "aiops:GetInvestigationEvent",

                "aiops:CreateReport",
                "aiops:UpdateReport", 
                "aiops:GetReport",

                "aiops:PutFact",
                "aiops:ListFacts",
                "aiops:GetFact",
                "aiops:GetFactVersions"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:aiops:*:*:investigation-group/*"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

 The new managed policy `AIOpsAssistantIncidentReportPolicy` provides
 the required permissions and is automatically added to investigation groups created
 after October 10, 2025. For more information, see [AIOpsAssistantIncidentReportPolicy](managed-policies-cloudwatch.md#managed-policies-QInvestigations-AIOpsAssistantIncidentReportPolicy "managed-policies-cloudwatch.md#managed-policies-QInvestigations-AIOpsAssistantIncidentReportPolicy").


## Additional permissions for Database Insights


To use Database Insights capabilities during investigations, you must attach the
 `AmazonRDSPerformanceInsightsFullAccess` managed policy to the IAM role
 or user that you use to perform investigations. CloudWatch investigations requires these permissions to
 create and access performance analysis reports for your Amazon RDS database instances.


To attach this policy, use the IAM console to add the
 `AmazonRDSPerformanceInsightsFullAccess` managed policy to your
 investigation principal. For more information about this managed policy and its
 permissions, see [AmazonRDSPerformanceInsightsFullAccess](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-managed-policy/latest/reference/AmazonRDSPerformanceInsightsFullAccess.html "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-managed-policy/latest/reference/AmazonRDSPerformanceInsightsFullAccess.html").


## How to control what data CloudWatch investigations has
 access to during investigations


When you configure an investigation group in your account, you specify what
 permissions that CloudWatch investigations has to access your resources during investigations. You do this by
 assigning an IAM role to the investigation group.


To enable CloudWatch investigations to access resources and be able to make suggestions and hypotheses, the
 recommended method is to attach the **AIOpsAssistantPolicy** to the investigation group role. This grants the
 investigation group permissions to analyze your AWS resources during your
 investigations. For information about the complete contents of this policy, see [AIOpsAssistantPolicy](managed-policies-cloudwatch.md#managed-policies-QInvestigations-AIOpsAssistant "managed-policies-cloudwatch.md#managed-policies-QInvestigations-AIOpsAssistant").


You can also choose to attach the general AWS [**ReadOnlyAccess**](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-managed-policy/latest/reference/ReadOnlyAccess.html "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-managed-policy/latest/reference/ReadOnlyAccess.html") to the investigation group role, in addition
 to attaching **AIOpsAssistantPolicy**. The reason to do
 this is that AWS updates **ReadOnlyAccess** more
 frequently with permissions for new AWS services and actions that are released. The
 **AIOpsAssistantPolicy** will also be updated for new
 actions, but not as frequently.


If you want to scope down the permissions granted to CloudWatch investigations, you can attach a custom
 IAM policy to the investigation group IAM role instead of attaching the **AIOpsAssistantPolicy** policy. To do this, start your custom
 policy with the contents of [AIOpsAssistantPolicy](managed-policies-cloudwatch.md#managed-policies-QInvestigations-AIOpsAssistant "managed-policies-cloudwatch.md#managed-policies-QInvestigations-AIOpsAssistant") and then remove permissions that you don't want to
 grant to CloudWatch investigations. This will prevent CloudWatch investigations from making suggestions based on the AWS
 services or actions that you don't grant access to.


###### Note

Anything that CloudWatch investigations can access can be added to the investigation and seen by your
 investigation operators. We recommend that you align CloudWatch investigations permissions with the
 permissions that your investigation group operators have.


### Allowing CloudWatch investigations to decrypt
 encrypted data during investigations


If you encrypt your data in any of the following services with a customer managed
 key in AWS KMS, and you want CloudWatch investigations to be able to decrypt the data from these services
 and include them in investigations, you'll need to attach one or more additional
 IAM policies to the investigation group IAM role. 



* AWS Step Functions

The policy statement should include a context key for encryption context to help
 scope down the permissions. For example, the following policy would enable CloudWatch investigations to
 decrypt data for a Step Functions state machine.



JSON





```
`{
 "Version":"2012-10-17", 
 "Statement": [
 {
 "Sid": "AIOPSKMSAccessForStepFunctions",

 "Service": "aiops.amazonaws.com"
 },
 "Action":

 }
 }

}`

```





For more information about these types of policies and using these context keys,
 see [kms:ViaService](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/conditions-kms.html#conditions-kms-via-service "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/conditions-kms.html#conditions-kms-via-service") and [kms:EncryptionContext:*context-key*](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/conditions-kms.html#conditions-kms-encryption-context "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/conditions-kms.html#conditions-kms-encryption-context") in the
 AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide, and [aws:SourceArn](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_condition-keys.html#condition-keys-sourcearn "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_condition-keys.html#condition-keys-sourcearn") in the IAM User Guide.


## Encryption of investigation data


For the encryption of your investigation data, AWS offers two options:



* **AWS owned keys**– By default, CloudWatch investigations
 encrypts investigation data at rest with an AWS owned key. You can't view or
 manage AWS owned keys, and you can't use them for other purposes or audit
 their use. However, you don't have to take any action or change any settings to
 use these keys. For more information about AWS owned keys, see [AWS owned
 keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#aws-owned-cmk "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#aws-owned-cmk").
* **Customer managed keys**– These are keys
 that you create and manage yourself. You can choose to use a customer managed
 key instead of an AWS owned key for your investigation data. For more
 information about customer managed keys, see [Customer managed
 keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#customer-cmk "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#customer-cmk").

Incident reports generated from investigations use the same encryption settings as the
 parent investigation. This maintains a consistent security posture across your
 investigation data and documentation


###### Note

CloudWatch investigations automatically enables encryption at rest using AWS owned keys at no charge.
 If you use a customer managed key, AWS KMS charges apply. For more information about
 pricing, see [AWS Key Management Service
 pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/kms/pricing/ "https://aws.amazon.com/kms/pricing/").


For more information about AWS KMS, see [AWS Key Management Service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/overview.html "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/overview.html").


### Using a customer managed key for
 your investigation group


You can associate an investigation group with a customer managed key, and then all
 investigations created in that group will use the customer managed key to encrypt
 your investigation data at rest.


CloudWatch investigations customer managed key usage has the following conditions:



* CloudWatch investigations supports only symmetric encryption AWS KMS keys with the default key
 spec, `SYMMETRIC_DEFAULT`, and that have usage defined as
 `ENCRYPT_DECRYPT`.
* For a user to create or update an investigation group with a customer
 managed key, that user must have the `kms:DescribeKey`,
 `kms:GenerateDataKey`, and `kms:Decrypt`
 permissions.
* For a user to create or update an investigation in an investigation group
 that uses a customer managed key, that user must have the
 `kms:GenerateDataKey` and `kms:Decrypt`
 permissions.
* For a user to view investigation data in an investigation group that uses
 a customer managed key, that user must have the `kms:Decrypt`
 permission.

### Setting up investigations to use a AWS KMS
 customer managed key


First, if you don't already have a symmetric key that you want to use, create a
 new key with the following command.



```
aws kms create-key
```

The command output includes the key ID and the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the
 key. You will need those in later steps in this section. The following is an example
 of this output.



```
{
"KeyMetadata": {
"Origin": "AWS_KMS",
        "KeyId": "1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab",
        "Description": "",
        "KeyManager": "CUSTOMER",
        "Enabled": true,
        "CustomerMasterKeySpec": "SYMMETRIC_DEFAULT",
        "KeyUsage": "ENCRYPT_DECRYPT",
        "KeyState": "Enabled",
        "CreationDate": 1478910250.94,
        "Arn": "arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:key/6f815f63-e628-448c-8251-e4EXAMPLE",
        "AWSAccountId": "111122223333",
        "EncryptionAlgorithms": [
            "SYMMETRIC_DEFAULT"
        ]
    }
}
```

**Set permissions on the key**


Next, set permissions on the key. By default, all AWS KMS keys are private. Only the
 resource owner can use it to encrypt and decrypt data. However, the resource owner
 can grant permissions to access the key to other users and resources. With this
 step, you give the AI Operations service principal permission to use the key. This
 service principal must be in the same AWS Region where the KMS key is
 stored.


As a best practice, we recommend that you restrict the use of the KMS key to only
 those AWS accounts or resources that you specify.


The first step to set the permissions is to save the default policy for your key
 as `policy.json`. Use the following command to do so. Replace
 `key-id` with the ID of your key.



```
aws kms get-key-policy --key-id `key-id` --policy-name default --output text > ./policy.json
```

Open the `policy.json` file in a text editor and add the
 following policy sections into that policy. Separate the existing statement from the
 new sections with a comma. These new sections use `Condition` sections to
 enhance the security of the AWS KMS key. For more information, see [AWS KMS keys and encryption context](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/encrypt-log-data-kms.html#encrypt-log-data-kms-policy "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/encrypt-log-data-kms.html#encrypt-log-data-kms-policy").


This policy provides permissions for service principals for the following
 reasons:



* The `aiops` service needs `GenerateDataKey`
 permissions to get the data key and use that data key to encrypt your data
 while it is stored in rest. The `Decrypt` permission is needed to
 decrypt your data while reading from the data store. The decryption happens
 when you read the data using `aiops` APIs or when you update the
 investigation or investigation event. The update operation fetches the
 existing data after decrypting it, updates the data, and stores the updated
 data in the data store after encrypting
* The CloudWatch alarms service can create investigations or investigation events.
 These create operations verify that the caller has access to the AWS KMS key
 defined for the investigation group. The policy statement gives the
 `GenerateDataKey` and `Decrypt` permissions to the
 CloudWatch alarms service to create investigations on behalf of you.

###### Note

The following policy assumes that you follow the recommendation of using three
 IAM principals, and granting one of them the **AIOpsConsoleAdminPolicy** IAM policy, granting another the
 **AIOpsOperatorAccess** policy, and granting
 the third the **AIOpsReadOnlyAccess** policy. These
 principals could be either IAM roles (recommended) or IAM users. Then your
 users who work with CloudWatch investigations would sign on with one of these principals.

For the following policy, you'll need the ARNs of those three
 principals.

```

After you've updated the policy, assign it to the key by entering the following
 command.



```
aws kms put-key-policy --key-id `key-id` --policy-name default --policy file://policy.json
```

**Associate the key with the investigation
 group**


When you use the CloudWatch console to create an investigation group, you can choose to
 associate the AWS KMS key with the investigation group. For more information, see
 [Set up an investigation
 group](Investigations-GetStarted-Group.md "Investigations-GetStarted-Group.md").


You can also associate a customer managed key with an existing investigation
 group.


### Changing your encryption
 configuration


You can update an investigation group to change between using a customer managed
 key or a service owned key. You can also change from using one customer managed key
 to using another. When you make such a change, the change applies to new
 investigations created after the change. Previous investigations are still
 associated with the old encryption configuration. Current ongoing investigations
 also continue using the original key for new data.


As long as a previously-used key is active and Amazon Q has access to it for
 investigations, you can retrieve the older investigations encrypted with that
 method, as well as data in current investigations that was encrypted with the
 previous key. If you delete a previously-used key or revoke access to it, the
 investigation data encrypted with that key can't be retrieved.


## Cross-Region inference


CloudWatch investigations uses *cross-Region inference* to distribute traffic across
 different AWS Region. Although the data remains stored only in the primary Region,
 when using cross-Region inference, your investigation data might move outside of your
 primary Region. All data will be transmitted encrypted across Amazon’s secure network. 


For details about where cross-Region inference distribution occurs for each Region,
 see the following table.




| Supported CloudWatch investigations geography | Investigation Region | Possible inference Regions |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **United States (US)** | US East (N. Virginia) | US East (N. Virginia), US East (Ohio), US West (Oregon) |
|  | US East (Ohio) | US East (N. Virginia), US East (Ohio), US West (Oregon) |
