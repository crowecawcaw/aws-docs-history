# Configuring how CloudWatch alarms treat missing

data

Sometimes, not every expected data point for a metric gets reported to CloudWatch. For example,
this can happen when a connection is lost, a server goes down, or when a metric reports data
only intermittently by design.

CloudWatch enables you to specify how to treat missing data points when evaluating an alarm.
This helps you to configure your alarm so that it goes to `ALARM` state only when
appropriate for the type of data being monitored. You can avoid false positives when missing
data doesn't indicate a problem.

Similar to how each alarm is always in one of three states, each specific data point
reported to CloudWatch falls under one of three categories:

- Not breaching (within the threshold)
- Breaching (violating the threshold)
- Missing
  For each alarm, you can specify CloudWatch to treat missing data points as any of the
  following:

- `notBreaching` – Missing data points are treated as "good" and
  within the threshold
- `breaching` – Missing data points are treated as "bad" and breaching
  the threshold
- `ignore` – The current alarm state is maintained
- `missing` – If all data points in the alarm evaluation range are
  missing, the alarm transitions to INSUFFICIENT_DATA.
  The best choice depends on the type of metric and the purpose of the alarm. For example,
  if you are creating an application rollback alarm using a metric that continually reports
  data, you might want to treat missing data points as breaching, because it might indicate that
  something is wrong. But for a metric that generates data points only when an error occurs,
  such as `ThrottledRequests` in Amazon DynamoDB, you would want to treat missing data as
  `notBreaching`. The default behavior is `missing`.

###### Important

Alarms configured on Amazon EC2 metrics can temporarily enter the INSUFFICIENT_DATA state if
there are missing metric data points. This is rare, but can happen when the metric reporting
is interrupted, even when the Amazon EC2 instance is healthy. For alarms on Amazon EC2 metrics that
are configured to take stop, terminate, reboot, or recover actions, we recommend that you
configure those alarms to treat missing data as `missing`, and to have these
alarms trigger only when in the ALARM state.

Choosing the best option for your alarm prevents unnecessary and misleading alarm
condition changes, and also more accurately indicates the health of your system.

###### Important

Alarms that evaluate metrics in the `AWS/DynamoDB` namespace always ignore
missing data even if you choose a different option for how the alarm should treat missing
data. When an `AWS/DynamoDB` metric has missing data, alarms that evaluate that
metric remain in their current state.

## How alarm state is evaluated when data is

missing

Whenever an alarm evaluates whether to change state, CloudWatch attempts to retrieve a higher
number of data points than the number specified as **Evaluation Periods**.
The exact number of data points it attempts to retrieve depends on the length of the alarm
period and whether it is based on a metric with standard resolution or high resolution. The
time frame of the data points that it attempts to retrieve is the _evaluation
range_.

Once CloudWatch retrieves these data points, the following happens:

- If no data points in the evaluation range are missing, CloudWatch evaluates the alarm
  based on the most recent data points collected. The number of data points evaluated is
  equal to the **Evaluation Periods** for the alarm. The extra data
  points from farther back in the evaluation range are not needed and are ignored.
- If some data points in the evaluation range are missing, but the total number of
  existing data points that were successfully retrieved from the evaluation range is equal
  to or more than the alarm's **Evaluation Periods**, CloudWatch evaluates the
  alarm state based on the most recent real data points that were successfully retrieved,
  including the necessary extra data points from farther back in the evaluation range. In
  this case, the value you set for how to treat missing data is not needed and is
  ignored.
- If some data points in the evaluation range are missing, and the number of actual
  data points that were retrieved is lower than the alarm's number of **Evaluation
  Periods**, CloudWatch fills in the missing data points with the result you
  specified for how to treat missing data, and then evaluates the alarm. However, all real
  data points in the evaluation range are included in the evaluation. CloudWatch uses missing
  data points only as few times as possible.

###### Note

A particular case of this behavior is that CloudWatch alarms might repeatedly re-evaluate
the last set of data points for a period of time after the metric has stopped flowing.
This re-evaluation might cause the alarm to change state and re-execute actions, if it had
changed state immediately prior to the metric stream stopping. To mitigate this behavior,
use shorter periods.

The following tables illustrate examples of the alarm evaluation behavior. In the first
table, **Datapoints to Alarm** and **Evaluation Periods**
are both 3. CloudWatch retrieves the 5 most recent data points when evaluating the alarm, in case
some of the most recent 3 data points are missing. 5 is the evaluation range for the
alarm.

Column 1 shows the 5 most recent data points, because the evaluation range is 5. These
data points are shown with the most recent data point on the right. 0 is a non-breaching
data point, X is a breaching data point, and - is a missing data point.

Column 2 shows how many of the 3 necessary data points are missing. Even though the most
recent 5 data points are evaluated, only 3 (the setting for **Evaluation
Periods**) are necessary to evaluate the alarm state. The number of data points
in Column 2 is the number of data points that must be "filled in", using the setting for how
missing data is being treated.

In columns 3-6, the column headers are the possible values for how to treat missing
data. The rows in these columns show the alarm state that is set for each of these possible
ways to treat missing data.

| Data points     | # of data points that must be filled | MISSING             | IGNORE               | BREACHING | NOT BREACHING |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------- | -------------------- | --------- | ------------- |
| 0<br>• X<br>• X | 0                                    | `OK`                | `OK`                 | `OK`      | `OK`          |
| 0<br>• -        | 2                                    | `OK`                | `OK`                 | `OK`      | `OK`          |
| • - - - -       | 3                                    | `INSUFFICIENT_DATA` | Retain current state | `ALARM`   | `OK`          |
| 0 X X<br>• X    | 0                                    | `ALARM`             | `ALARM`              | `ALARM`   | `ALARM`       |
| • - X - -       | 2                                    | `ALARM`             | Retain current state | `ALARM`   | `OK`          |

In the second row of the preceding table, the alarm stays `OK` even if
missing data is treated as breaching, because the one existing data point is not breaching,
and this is evaluated along with two missing data points which are treated as breaching. The
next time this alarm is evaluated, if the data is still missing it will go to
`ALARM`, as that non-breaching data point will no longer be in the evaluation
range.

The third row, where all five of the most recent data points are missing, illustrates
how the various settings for how to treat missing data affect the alarm state. If missing
data points are considered breaching, the alarm goes into ALARM state, while if they are
considered not breaching, then the alarm goes into OK state. If missing data points are
ignored, the alarm retains the current state it had before the missing data points. And if
missing data points are just considered as missing, then the alarm does not have enough
recent real data to make an evaluation, and goes into INSUFFICIENT_DATA.

In the fourth row, the alarm goes to `ALARM` state in all cases because the
three most recent data points are breaching, and the alarm's **Evaluation
Periods** and **Datapoints to Alarm** are both set to 3. In this
case, the missing data point is ignored and the setting for how to evaluate missing data is
not needed, because there are 3 real data points to evaluate.

Row 5 represents a special case of alarm evaluation called _premature alarm
state_. For more information, see [Avoiding premature
transitions to alarm state](#CloudWatch-alarms-avoiding-premature-transition "#CloudWatch-alarms-avoiding-premature-transition").

In the next table, the **Period** is again set to 5 minutes, and
**Datapoints to Alarm** is only 2 while **Evaluation
Periods** is 3. This is a 2 out of 3, M out of N alarm.

The evaluation range is 5. This is the maximum number of recent data points that are
retrieved and can be used in case some data points are missing.

| Data points     | # of missing data points | MISSING | IGNORE               | BREACHING | NOT BREACHING |
| --------------- | ------------------------ | ------- | -------------------- | --------- | ------------- |
| 0<br>• X<br>• X | 0                        | `ALARM` | `ALARM`              | `ALARM`   | `ALARM`       |
| 0 0 X 0 X       | 0                        | `ALARM` | `ALARM`              | `ALARM`   | `ALARM`       |
| 0<br>• X<br>• - | 1                        | `OK`    | `OK`                 | `ALARM`   | `OK`          |
| • - - - 0       | 2                        | `OK`    | `OK`                 | `ALARM`   | `OK`          |
| • - - X -       | 2                        | `ALARM` | Retain current state | `ALARM`   | `OK`          |

In rows 1 and 2, the alarm always goes to ALARM state because 2 of the 3 most recent
data points are breaching. In row 2, the two oldest data points in the evaluation range are
not needed because none of the 3 most recent data points are missing, so these two older
data points are ignored.

In rows 3 and 4, the alarm goes to ALARM state only if missing data is treated as
breaching, in which case the two most recent missing data points are both treated as
breaching. In row 4, these two missing data points that are treated as breaching provide the
two necessary breaching data points to trigger the ALARM state.

Row 5 represents a special case of alarm evaluation called _premature alarm
state_. For more information, see the following section.

### Avoiding premature

transitions to alarm state

CloudWatch alarm evaluation includes logic to try to avoid false alarms, where the alarm
goes into ALARM state prematurely when data is intermittent. The example shown in row 5 in
the tables in the previous section illustrate this logic. In those rows, and in the
following examples, the **Evaluation Periods** is 3 and the evaluation
range is 5 data points. **Datapoints to Alarm** is 3, except for the M
out of N example, where **Datapoints to Alarm** is 2.

Suppose an alarm's most recent data is `- - - - X`, with four missing data
points and then a breaching data point as the most recent data point. Because the next
data point may be non-breaching, the alarm does not go immediately into ALARM state when
the data is either `- - - - X` or `- - - X -` and
**Datapoints to Alarm** is 3. This way, false positives are avoided
when the next data point is non-breaching and causes the data to be `- - - X O`
or `- - X - O`.

However, if the last few data points are `- - X - -`, the alarm goes into
ALARM state even if missing data points are treated as missing. This is because alarms are
designed to always go into ALARM state when the oldest available breaching datapoint
during the **Evaluation Periods** number of data points is at least as
old as the value of **Datapoints to Alarm**, and all other more recent
data points are breaching or missing. In this case, the alarm goes into ALARM state even
if the total number of datapoints available is lower than M (**Datapoints to
Alarm**).

This alarm logic applies to M out of N alarms as well. If the oldest breaching data
point during the evaluation range is at least as old as the value of **Datapoints
to Alarm**, and all of the more recent data points are either breaching or
missing, the alarm goes into ALARM state no matter the value of M (**Datapoints to
Alarm**).

## Missing Data in CloudWatch Metrics Insights alarms

**Alarms based on Metrics Insights queries that aggregate to a
single time series**

The missing data scenarios and their effects upon alarm evaluation are the same as a standard
metric alarm in terms of the configured missing data treatment. See, [Configuring how CloudWatch alarms treat missing
data](alarms-and-missing-data.md "alarms-and-missing-data.md").

**Alarms based on Metrics Insights queries that produce multiple time series**

Missing data scenarios for Metrics Insights alarms occur when:

- Individual datapoints within a time series are not present.
- One or more time series disappear when evaluating upon multiple time series.
- No time series are retrieved by the query.

Missing data scenarios affect the alarm evaluation in the following manner:

- For the evaluation of a time series, the treat missing data treatment is applied for individual
  datapoints within the time series. For example, if 3 datapoints were queried for the time series but
  only 1 was received, 2 datapoints would follow the configured missing data configuration.
- If a time series is not retrieved by the query anymore, it will transition to `OK` no matter
  the treat missing data treatment. Alarm actions associated with the `OK` transition at the
  contributor level are executed and the `StateReason` specifies that the aforementioned
  contributor was not found with the message, "No data was returned for this contributor".
  The state of the alarm will depend on the state of the other contributors that were
  retrieved by the query.
- At alarm level, if the query returns an empty result (no time series at all), the treat missing
  data treatment is applied. For example, if the treat missing data was set as `BREACHING`,
  the alarm will transition to `ALARM`.
