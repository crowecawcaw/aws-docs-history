# CloudWatch investigations data retention

The retention period that you set for an investigation group determines how long that
investigation data is kept. Valid values are seven days to 90 days.

After you first create an investigation, if you don't end it manually, it moves to a
CLOSED state automatically after seven days. Then, the retention period determines how
long the data is kept after the investigation moves to the CLOSED state. The data that
is kept during the retention period includes the data in the investigation, accepted and
discarded findings, and AI assistant audit log messages.

When this retention period expires, the investigation data is deleted.

If you manually end an investigation, that also moves the investigation to the CLOSED
state and the retention period time begins to be in effect.

###### Note

Investigations conducted without configuring your CloudWatch investigations settings are linked to individual user sessions and are deleted after 24 hours,
with no recovery option available.

## Incident report retention

Incident reports generated from investigations follow the same retention policy as
their parent investigations.

We recommend copying important incident reports to external systems if you need to
retain them beyond the investigation retention period.
