# Starting the CloudWatch agent

You can start the CloudWatch agent using either Systems Manager Run Command or the command line.

For information about setting up the agent on a system that has security-enhanced Linux
 (SELinux) enabled, see [Set up the CloudWatch agent with security-enhanced Linux
 (SELinux)](CloudWatch-Agent-SELinux.md "CloudWatch-Agent-SELinux.md").


##  Start the CloudWatch agent using the
 command line on Amazon EC2


Follow these steps to use the command line to start the CloudWatch agent on on Amazon EC2.


For information about setting up the agent on a system that has security-enhanced Linux

 (SELinux)](CloudWatch-Agent-SELinux.md "CloudWatch-Agent-SELinux.md").


###### To use the command line to start the CloudWatch agent on on Amazon EC2

1. Copy the agent configuration file that you want to use to the server where you're
 going to run the agent. Note the pathname where you copy it to.
2. In this command, `-a fetch-config` causes the agent to load the latest
 version of the CloudWatch agent configuration file, and `-s` starts the
 agent.


Enter one of the following commands. Replace
 `configuration-file-path` with the path to the agent
 configuration file. This file is called `config.json` if you created
 it with the wizard, and might be called
 `amazon-cloudwatch-agent.json` if you created it manually.


On an EC2 instance running Linux, enter the following command. 



```
sudo /opt/aws/amazon-cloudwatch-agent/bin/amazon-cloudwatch-agent-ctl -a fetch-config -m ec2 -s -c file:`configuration-file-path`
```

On an on-premises server running Linux, enter the following:



```
sudo /opt/aws/amazon-cloudwatch-agent/bin/amazon-cloudwatch-agent-ctl -a fetch-config -m onPremise -s -c file:`configuration-file-path`
```

On an EC2 instance running Windows Server, enter the following from the PowerShell
 console:



```
& "C:\Program Files\Amazon\AmazonCloudWatchAgent\amazon-cloudwatch-agent-ctl.ps1" -a fetch-config -m ec2 -s -c file:`configuration-file-path`
```

On an on-premises server running Windows Server, enter the following from the
 PowerShell console:



```
& "C:\Program Files\Amazon\AmazonCloudWatchAgent\amazon-cloudwatch-agent-ctl.ps1" -a fetch-config -m onPremise -s -c file:`configuration-file-path`
```

## Start the CloudWatch agent on an on-premises
 server


Follow these steps to start the CloudWatch agent on an on-premises server.


###### To use SSM Agent to start the CloudWatch agent on an on-premises server

1. Open the Systems Manager console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/ "https://console.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/").
2. In the navigation pane, choose 
 **Run Command**.


-or-


If the AWS Systems Manager home page opens, scroll down and 
 choose **Explore Run Command**.
3. Choose **Run command**.
4. In the **Command document** list, select the button next to
 **AmazonCloudWatch-ManageAgent**.
5. In the **Targets** area, select the instance where you installed
 the agent.
6. In the **Action** list, choose
 **configure**.
7. In the **Mode** list, choose **onPremise**.
8. In the **Optional Configuration Location** box, enter the name of
 the agent configuration file that you created with the wizard and stored in the
 Parameter Store.
9. Choose **Run**.


The agent starts with the configuration you specified in the configuration
 file.

Linux: If you saved the configuration file in the Systems Manager Parameter Store, enter the
 following:



```
sudo /opt/aws/amazon-cloudwatch-agent/bin/amazon-cloudwatch-agent-ctl -a fetch-config -m onPremise -s -c ssm:`configuration-parameter-store-name`
```

Linux: If you saved the configuration file on the local computer, enter the
 following command. Replace `configuration-file-path` with the
 path to the agent configuration file. This file is called
 `config.json` if you created it with the wizard, and might be
 called `amazon-cloudwatch-agent.json` if you created it
 manually.



```
sudo /opt/aws/amazon-cloudwatch-agent/bin/amazon-cloudwatch-agent-ctl -a fetch-config -m onPremise -s -c file:`configuration-file-path`
```

Windows Server: If you saved the agent configuration file in Systems Manager Parameter Store, enter
 the following from the PowerShell console:



```
& "C:\Program Files\Amazon\AmazonCloudWatchAgent\amazon-cloudwatch-agent-ctl.ps1" -a fetch-config -m onPremise -s -c ssm:`configuration-parameter-store-name`
