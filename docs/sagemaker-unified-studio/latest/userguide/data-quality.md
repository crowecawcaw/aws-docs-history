# Data quality in Amazon SageMaker Unified Studio

Data quality metrics in Amazon SageMaker Unified Studio help you understand the different quality metrics
such as completeness, timeliness, and accuracy of your data sources. Amazon SageMaker Unified Studio
integrates with AWS Glue Data Quality and offers APIs to integrate data quality metrics
from third-party data quality solutions. Data users can see how data quality metrics
change over time for their subscribed assets. To author and run the data quality rules,
you can use your data quality tool of choice such as AWS Glue data quality. With data
quality metrics in Amazon DataZone, data consumers can visualize the data quality scores
for the assets and columns, helping build trust in the data they use for decisions.

**Prerequisites and IAM role changes**

If you are using Amazon SageMaker Unified Studio's AWS managed policies, there are no additional
configuration steps and these managed policies are automatically updated to support data
quality. If you are using your own policies for the roles that grant Amazon SageMaker Unified Studio the
required permissions to interoperate with supported services, you must update the
policies attached to these roles to enable support for reading the AWS Glue data quality
information.

## Enabling data quality for AWS Glue

assets

Amazon SageMaker Unified Studio pulls the data quality metrics from AWS Glue in order to provide context
during a point in time, for example, during a business data catalog search. Data
users can see how data quality metrics change over time for their subscribed assets.
Data producers can ingest AWS Glue data quality scores on a schedule. The Amazon SageMaker Unified Studio
business data catalog can also display data quality metrics from third-party systems
through data quality APIs. For more information, see [AWS
Glue Data Quality](../../../glue/latest/dg/glue-data-quality.md "../../../glue/latest/dg/glue-data-quality.md") and [Getting started with AWS Glue Data Quality for the Data Catalog](../../../glue/latest/dg/data-quality-getting-started.md "../../../glue/latest/dg/data-quality-getting-started.md").

You can enable data quality metrics for your Amazon SageMaker Unified Studio assets in the following
ways:

- Use Amazon SageMaker Unified Studio or the Amazon DataZone APIs to enable data quality for your AWS Glue
  data source via the Amazon SageMaker Unified Studio either while creating new or editing existing
  AWS Glue data source.

###### Note

You can use Amazon SageMaker Unified Studio to enable data quality only for your AWS Glue
inventory assets. In this release of Amazon SageMaker Unified Studio, enabling data quality
for custom types assets in Amazon SageMaker Unified Studio must be done using APIs.

- You can also use the APIs to enable data quality for your new or existing
  data sources. You can do this by invoking the [CreateDataSource](../../../datazone/datazone/latest/APIReference/API_CreateDataSource.md "../../../datazone/datazone/latest/APIReference/API_CreateDataSource.md") or [UpdateDataSource](../../../datazone/datazone/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateDataSource.md "../../../datazone/datazone/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateDataSource.md") APIs and setting the
  `autoImportDataQualityResult` parameter to 'True'.

After data quality is enabled, you can run the data source on demand or on
schedule. Each run can bring in up to 100 metrics per asset. There is no need to
create forms or add metrics manually when using data source for data quality. When
the asset is published, the updates that were made to the data quality form (up to
30 data points per rule of history) are reflected in the listing for the consumers.
Subsequently, each new addition of metrics to the asset is automatically added to
the listing. There is no need to republish the asset to make the latest scores
available to consumers.

## Enabling data quality for custom

asset types

You can use the Amazon SageMaker Unified Studio APIs to enable data quality for any of your custom type
assets. For more information, see the following:

- [PostTimeSeriesDataPoints](../../../datazone/latest/APIReference/API_PostTimeSeriesDataPoints.md "../../../datazone/latest/APIReference/API_PostTimeSeriesDataPoints.md")
- [ListTimeSeriesDataPoints](../../../datazone/latest/APIReference/API_ListTimeSeriesDataPoints.md "../../../datazone/latest/APIReference/API_ListTimeSeriesDataPoints.md")
- [GetTimeSeriesDataPoint](../../../datazone/latest/APIReference/API_GetTimeSeriesDataPoint.md "../../../datazone/latest/APIReference/API_GetTimeSeriesDataPoint.md")
- [DeleteTimeSeriesDataPoints](../../../datazone/latest/APIReference/API_DeleteTimeSeriesDataPoints.md "../../../datazone/latest/APIReference/API_DeleteTimeSeriesDataPoints.md")

The following steps provide an example of using APIs or CLI to import third-party
metrics for your assets in Amazon SageMaker Unified Studio:

1. Invoke the `PostTimeSeriesDataPoints` API as follows:

```

aws datazone post-time-series-data-points  \
--cli-input-json file://createTimeSeriesPayload.json \

```

with the following payload:

```

"domainId": "dzd_5oo7xzoqltu8mf",
    "entityId": "4wyh64k2n8czaf",
    "entityType": "ASSET",
    "form": {
        "content": "{\n  \"evaluations\" : [ {\n    \"types\" : [ \"MaximumLength\" ],\n    \"description\" : \"ColumnLength \\\"ShippingCountry\\\" <= 6\",\n    \"details\" : { },\n    \"applicableFields\" : [ \"ShippingCountry\" ],\n    \"status\" : \"PASS\"\n  }, {\n    \"types\" : [ \"MaximumLength\" ],\n    \"description\" : \"ColumnLength \\\"ShippingState\\\" <= 2\",\n    \"details\" : { },\n    \"applicableFields\" : [ \"ShippingState\" ],\n    \"status\" : \"PASS\"\n  }, {\n    \"types\" : [ \"MaximumLength\" ],\n    \"description\" : \"ColumnLength \\\"ShippingCity\\\" <= 8\",\n    \"details\" : { },\n    \"applicableFields\" : [ \"ShippingCity\" ],\n    \"status\" : \"PASS\"\n  }, {\n    \"types\" : [ \"Completeness\" ],\n    \"description\" : \"Completeness \\\"ShippingStreet\\\" >= 0.59\",\n    \"details\" : { },\n    \"applicableFields\" : [ \"ShippingStreet\" ],\n    \"status\" : \"PASS\"\n  }, {\n    \"types\" : [ \"MaximumLength\" ],\n    \"description\" : \"ColumnLength \\\"ShippingStreet\\\" <= 101\",\n    \"details\" : { },\n    \"applicableFields\" : [ \"ShippingStreet\" ],\n    \"status\" : \"PASS\"\n  }, {\n    \"types\" : [ \"MaximumLength\" ],\n    \"description\" : \"ColumnLength \\\"BillingCountry\\\" <= 6\",\n    \"details\" : { },\n    \"applicableFields\" : [ \"BillingCountry\" ],\n    \"status\" : \"PASS\"\n  }, {\n    \"types\" : [ \"Completeness\" ],\n    \"description\" : \"Completeness \\\"biLlingcountry\\\" >= 0.5\",\n    \"details\" : {\n      \"EVALUATION_MESSAGE\" : \"Value: 0.26666666666666666 does not meet the constraint requirement!\"\n    },\n    \"applicableFields\" : [ \"biLlingcountry\" ],\n    \"status\" : \"FAIL\"\n  }, {\n    \"types\" : [ \"Completeness\" ],\n    \"description\" : \"Completeness \\\"Billingstreet\\\" >= 0.5\",\n    \"details\" : { },\n    \"applicableFields\" : [ \"Billingstreet\" ],\n    \"status\" : \"PASS\"\n  } ],\n  \"passingPercentage\" : 88.0,\n  \"evaluationsCount\" : 8\n}",
        "formName": "shortschemaruleset",
        "id": "athp9dyw75gzhj",
        "timestamp": 1.71700477757E9,
        "typeIdentifier": "amazon.datazone.DataQualityResultFormType",
        "typeRevision": "8"
    },
    "formName": "shortschemaruleset"
}
```

You can obtain this payload by invoking the `GetFormType`
action:

```

aws datazone get-form-type --domain-identifier <your_domain_id> --form-type-identifier amazon.datazone.DataQualityResultFormType --region <domain_region> --output text --query 'model.smithy'

```

2. Invoke the `DeleteTimeSeriesDataPoints` API as follows:

```

aws datazone delete-time-series-data-points\
--domain-identifier dzd_bqqlk3nz21zp2f \
--entity-identifier dzd_bqqlk3nz21zp2f \
--entity-type ASSET \
--form-name rulesET1 \

```
