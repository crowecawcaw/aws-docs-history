# Build a flow app with Amazon Bedrock

A flow app let you link prompts, supported foundational models, and other units of
work, such as an Amazon Bedrock knowledge base, together and create generative AI workflows for end-to-end
solutions. For example, you could create flow apps to do the following.

- **Create a playlist of music** – Create a flow
  connecting a prompt node and knowledge base node. Provide the following
  prompt to generate a playlist: `Create a playlist`. After processing
  the prompt, the flow queries a knowledge base to look up information about local bands, such as the length
  of songs and genre of music. The flow then generates a playlist based the information in the knowledge base.
- **Troubleshoot using the error message and the ID of the resource that
  is causing the error** – The flow looks up the possible causes of the error from
  a documentation knowledge base, pulls system logs and other relevant information about the
  resource, and updates the faulty configurations and values for the resource.
  In this section you create a flow app that generates a playlist of music from a
  knowledge base of songs by fictional local bands.

To create a flow app, you use the _flow
builder_ which is a tool in
Amazon Bedrock in SageMaker Unified Studio to build and edit flow apps through a visual interface. You use the visual
interface to drag and drop nodes onto the interface and configure inputs and outputs for these
nodes to define your flow.

In your flow you can apply logical conditions to direct the output from a node to different
destinations. You can then run the flow within Amazon Bedrock in SageMaker Unified Studio and view the output.

The following list introduces you to the basic elements of a flow.

- **Flow** – A flow is a construct consisting of a
  name, description, permissions, a collection of nodes, and connections between nodes. When you
  run a flow, the input to the flow is sent through each node of the flow until the
  flow emits the final output from an output node.
- **Node** – A node is a step inside a flow. For
  each node, you configure its name, description, input, output, and any additional
  configurations. The configuration of a node differs based on its type.

For information about the types of nodes that Amazon Bedrock in SageMaker Unified Studio supports, see [Flow nodes available in Amazon Bedrock](nodes.md "nodes.md").

- **Connection** – There are two types of connections
  used in flow apps:
  - A **data connection** is drawn between the output of one
    node (the _source node_) and the input of another node (the
    _target node_) and sends data from an upstream node to a downstream node.
    In the flow builder, data connections are solid lines.
  - A **conditional connection** is drawn between a condition
    in a condition node and a downstream node and sends data from the node that precedes the
    condition node to a downstream node if the condition is fulfilled. In the flow builder,
    conditional connections are dotted lines.

- **Expressions** – An expression defines how to extract
  an input from the whole input entering a node. To learn how to write expressions, see [Define inputs with expressions](flows-expressions.md "flows-expressions.md").
  If you want to use your flow app outside of Amazon SageMaker Unified Studio, you can export and deploy
  the app to an AWS account. For more information, see [Use your app outside of Amazon SageMaker Unified Studio](app-export.md "app-export.md").
