## AWS Health event

AWS Health events, also known as Health events, are notifications that AWS Health sends
on behalf of other AWS services. You can use these events to learn about upcoming or
scheduled changes that might affect your account. For example, AWS Health can send an event
if AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) plans to deprecate a managed policy or AWS Config plans to deprecate a
managed rule. AWS Health also sends events when there are service availability issues in an
AWS Region. You can review the event description to understand the issue, identify any
affected resources, and take any recommended actions.

There are two types of Health events:

###### Contents

- [Account-specific event](aws-health-concepts-and-terms.md#account-specific-event "aws-health-concepts-and-terms.md#account-specific-event")
- [Public event](aws-health-concepts-and-terms.md#public-event "aws-health-concepts-and-terms.md#public-event")

### Account-specific event

Account-specific events are local to either your AWS account or an account in your
AWS organization. For example, if there's an issue with an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instance type
in a Region that you use, AWS Health provides information about the event and the name of
the affected resources.

You can find account-specific events from your [AWS Health Dashboard](https://health.aws.amazon.com/health/home "https://health.aws.amazon.com/health/home"), the [AWS Health
API](../APIReference/Welcome.md "../APIReference/Welcome.md"), or use [Amazon EventBridge](cloudwatch-events-health.md "cloudwatch-events-health.md") or [AWS User Notifications](#user-notifications "#user-notifications") to receive
notifications.

### Public event

Public events are reported service events that aren't specific to an account. For
example, if there's a service issue for Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) in the US East (Ohio) Region, AWS Health
provides information about the event, even if you don't use that service or have S3 buckets
in that Region. We recommend that you review public notifications before you take action on
them.

You can find public events from your AWS Health Dashboard and the AWS Health Dashboard – Service health.

If you have an account, see [Getting started with your
AWS Health Dashboard](getting-started-health-dashboard.md "getting-started-health-dashboard.md").

If you don't have an account, see [AWS Health Dashboard](aws-health-dashboard-status.md "aws-health-dashboard-status.md").

## AWS Health Dashboard

If you have an AWS account, your AWS Health Dashboard shows both _public_ events and _account-specific_
events.

We recommend that you use your AWS Health Dashboard to learn about events that provide general awareness,
such as an upcoming maintenance issue for a service in a Region. You can also use the AWS Health Dashboard to
learn about events that might affect you directly, such as a deprecated resource in your
account.

You can sign in to the AWS Management Console to view your AWS Health Dashboard at [https://health.aws.amazon.com/health/home](https://health.aws.amazon.com/health/home "https://health.aws.amazon.com/health/home").

For more information, see [Getting started with your
AWS Health Dashboard](getting-started-health-dashboard.md "getting-started-health-dashboard.md").

### AWS Health Dashboard – Service health

If you don't have an account, you can use the AWS Health Dashboard – Service health at [https://health.aws.amazon.com/health/status](https://health.aws.amazon.com/health/status "https://health.aws.amazon.com/health/status") to view public events. Public events are reported service issues for
AWS that provide information about service availability. This website only shows
public events, which aren’t specific to any account. You don't need to sign in or have an
account to view this page.

For more information, see [AWS Health Dashboard](aws-health-dashboard-status.md "aws-health-dashboard-status.md").

## Event type code

The event type codes shown in a Health event include the affected service and the type of
event. For example, if you receive a Health event that has the
`AWS_EC2_SYSTEM_MAINTENANCE_EVENT` event type code, this means that the service
is scheduling a maintenance event that might affect you. Use this information to plan ahead or
take action for your account.

## Event type categories

All Health events have an associated event type category. For some events, the event type
category might appear in the event type code, such as the
`AWS_RDS_MAINTENANCE_SCHEDULED` code. In this example, the category is
_scheduled_. You can use this information to understand event categories
at
a high level.

It's a best practice that you monitor all event type categories. Note that each category appears
for different types of events. You can also use the [DescribeEventTypes](../APIReference/API_DescribeEventTypes.md "../APIReference/API_DescribeEventTypes.md") API operation to find the event type category.

**Account notification**

These events provide information about the administration or security of your
accounts and services. These events might be informative, or they might require urgent
action from you. We recommend that you pay attention for these types of events and
review all recommended actions.

The following are example event type codes for account notifications:

- `AWS_S3_OPEN_ACCESS_BUCKET_NOTIFICATION` – You have an Amazon S3
  bucket that might allow public access.
- `AWS_BILLING_SUSPENSION_NOTICE` – Your account has outstanding
  charges and has been suspended, or you deactivated your account.
- `AWS_WORKSPACES_OPERATIONAL_NOTIFICATION` – There’s a service
  issue for Amazon WorkSpaces.

**Issue**

These events are unexpected events that affect AWS services or resources. Common
events in this category include communications about operational issues that are causing
service degradation, or localized resource-level issues for your awareness.

The following are example event type codes for issues:

- `AWS_EC2_OPERATIONAL_ISSUE` – An operational issue for a
  service, such as delays in using a service.
- `AWS_EC2_API_ISSUE` – An operational issue for a service's
  API, such as increased latency for an API operation.
- `AWS_EBS_VOLUME_ATTACHMENT_ISSUE` – A localized resource-level
  issue that might affect your Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) resources.
- `AWS_ABUSE_PII_CONTENT_REMOVAL_REPORT` – This event means that
  your account might be suspended if you don't take action.

**Scheduled change**

These events provide information about upcoming changes to your services and
resources. These events include planned lifecycle events such as end-of-support
notifications and auto-upgrades for different versions. Some events might recommend that
you take action to avoid service disruptions, while others will occur automatically
without any action on your part. Your resource might be temporarily unavailable during
the scheduled change activity. All events in this category are account-specific
events.

The following are example event type codes for scheduled changes:

- `AWS_EC2_INSTANCE_RETIREMENT_SCHEDULED` – An Amazon EC2 instance
  requires a reboot.
- `AWS_SAGEMAKER_SCHEDULED_MAINTENANCE` – SageMaker AI requires a
  maintenance event, such as fixing a service issue.
- `AWS_RDS_PLANNED_LIFECYCLE_EVENT` – Amazon RDS is scheduling a
  planned lifecycle event, such as an end-of-support event for one of its versions,
  which requires customer action.

###### Tip

If you use the AWS Health API or the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) to return event details,
the `Event` object contains the `eventScopeCode` field with the
`ACCOUNT_SPECIFIC` value. For more information, see the
[AWS Health API Reference](../APIReference.md "../APIReference.md").

## Event status

The event status tells you if the Health event is open, closed, or upcoming. You can view
Health events in the AWS Health Dashboard or the AWS Health API for up to 90 days.

## Actionability

Actionability is a field that helps you prioritize Health events based on whether an
action is required from you. Health events include an actionability status that indicates if
you need to take action to mitigate risks to your AWS resources or if the event is
informational in nature.

The actionability field can contain one of the following values:

- `ACTION_REQUIRED`: Events with this status require action from you to mitigate potential
  impact related to availability, billing, or security of your AWS resources.
- `ACTION_MAY_BE_REQUIRED`: Events with this status communicate changes that
  require action, based on your specific implementation, dependencies, and workflows. These
  events require your review to determine if action is needed.
- `INFORMATIONAL`: Events with this status provide ongoing visibility into
  operational information about the AWS services that you use. No immediate action is
  expected.

###### Note

Health events related to service issues don't include an actionability label, as the
need for recovery actions depends on your specific application architecture.

## Personas

The personas field provides a list of contacts that helps you route relevant information to appropriate teams within your organization. Each Health event can include one or more of the following personas:

- `OPERATIONS`: For events related to operational activities and service availability.
- `SECURITY`: For events related to security considerations.
- `BILLING`: For events with potential cost implications.

For example, when AWS sends an event about the end of standard support that converts into extended support, the event includes `BILLING` in addition to `OPERATIONS` within the persona list to help make sure the information reaches teams responsible for cost management.

## Affected entities

Affected entities are AWS resources that might be affected by the event. For example, if
you receive a scheduled event for Amazon EC2 maintenance for a specific instance type that you're
using in your account, you can use the Health event to determine the ID of the affected
instances. Use this information to address any potential service issue, such as creating or
deprecating resources.

## AWS Health events on Amazon EventBridge

You can setup Amazon EventBridge rules for your accounts to automate actions after the appropriate
AWS Health event is received by an account. These can be general actions, such as sending all
planned lifecycle event messages to a chat interface. Or, they can be specific actions, such
as triggering a workflow in an IT service management tool.

For more information, see [Monitoring events in AWS Health with
Amazon EventBridge](cloudwatch-events-health.md "cloudwatch-events-health.md").

## AWS Health API

You can use the AWS Health API to programmatically access the information that appears in
the [AWS Health Dashboard](https://health.aws.amazon.com/health/home "https://health.aws.amazon.com/health/home"), such as the following:

- Get information about events that might affect your AWS services and
  resources
- Enable or disable the organizational view feature for your AWS organization
- Filter your events by specific services, event type categories, and event type
  codes

For more information, see the [AWS Health API Reference](../APIReference/Welcome.md "../APIReference/Welcome.md").

###### Note

You must have a AWS Business Support+, AWS Enterprise Support, or AWS Unified Operations plan from [AWS Support](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/ "https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/") to use the AWS Health API. If you call the AWS Health API from an
account that doesn't have a AWS Business Support+, AWS Enterprise Support, or AWS Unified Operations plan, you receive a
`SubscriptionRequiredException` error.

## Organizational view

You can use this feature to aggregate all health events for AWS accounts in your
AWS Organizations into a single view in the AWS Health Dashboard. You can then sign in to the management account of
your organization or use the AWS Health API to view all events that might affect the
different accounts and resources. You can enable this feature from the AWS Health console or
API. For more information, see [Aggregating AWS Health events across accounts](aggregate-events.md "aggregate-events.md").

## AWS User Notifications

AWS Health integrates with [AWS User Notifications](../../../notifications/latest/userguide/managed-notifications.md "../../../notifications/latest/userguide/managed-notifications.md") so that you can easily receive and control notifications about events affecting your AWS accounts and services. User Notifications offers managed notifications for AWS Health events by default. You can configure these subscriptions to control how often you receive messages through time-based aggregation, what kinds of AWS Health events you get notified about, and where notifications are delivered. To get started, open User Notifications in the [AWS Management Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/notifications "https://console.aws.amazon.com/notifications"). For more information, see [Manage AWS Health notifications in AWS User Notifications](manage-user-notifications.md "manage-user-notifications.md")
