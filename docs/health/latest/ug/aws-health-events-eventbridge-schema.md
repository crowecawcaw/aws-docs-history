| service | The AWS service affected by the AWS Health event. For example, Amazon EC2, Amazon Simple Storage Service, Amazon Redshift, or Amazon Relational Database Service.  | Yes | 
| eventTypeCode | The unique identifier for the event type. For example: AWS\_EC2\_INSTANCE\_NETWORK\_MAINTENANCE\_SCHEDULED and AWS\_EC2\_INSTANCE\_REBOOT\_MAINTENANCE\_SCHEDULED.

This identifier can be used with the account ID to help de-duplicate messages.<br />With the AWS Health event pagination support, the communication ID includes the page number to keep the communication ID unique across pages, for example, 12345678910-1. For more information, see [Viewing paginated lists of AWS Health events on EventBridge](pagnation-of-health-events.md). | Yes |

| statusCode | The status of the AWS Health event.<br />Supported values include `open`, `closed`, and `upcoming`. | Yes | 
| eventRegion | The impacted Region described by this AWS Health event. | Yes | 
| eventDescription | A section that describes the AWS Health event. This includes fields for language and text to describe the event.+  **language** – The code for the language used in the AWS Health event.

For example, in the `us-east-1` Region, this is typically `en_US`. <br />+  **latestDescription** – Describes the AWS Health event as it is rendered from the AWS Health API and typically appears on the the AWS Health dashboard.  For public events, this contains only the latest update and not the entire history of the event.   | Yes | 
| eventMetadata | Additional event metadata that can be provided for the AWS Health event.+  **<metadata key 1>** – Metadata key-value pair strings: "keystring1": "keyvalue1" <br />The key-value pairs for event metadata are determined by the service that sent the AWS Health event.  | No | 
| affectedEntities | An array that describes the resource value and status of affected resources within the AWS Health event.+  **entityValue** – The resource/entity ID. <br />+  **lastUpdatedtime** – The time when this resource/entity status was last updated, in the format `DoW, DD MMM YYYY HH:MM:SS TZ`. <br />+  **status** – The status of the affected resource/entity. Supported values include `IMPAIRED`, `UNIMPAIRED`, `PENDING`, `RESOLVED`, and `UNKNOWN`.  For planned lifecycle events, resource state updates are performed asynchronously and periodically, and can have a delay of up to 72 hours in rare occasions. For more information, see [What should I expect when I receive a planned lifecycle event notification?](aws-health-planned-lifecycle-events.md#planned-lifecycle-event-notifications).  | No | 
| page | The page this message represents. For more information, see [Viewing paginated lists of AWS Health events on EventBridge](pagnation-of-health-events.md). Pagination occurs only on resources. If the 256KB size limit is exceeded for another reason, the communication to fail.  | Yes |
