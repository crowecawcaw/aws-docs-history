# Creating and integrating chat channels for responders in

Incident Manager

Incident Manager, a tool in AWS Systems Manager, gives incident responders the ability to communicate
directly through _chat channels_ during an incident. A
_chat channel_ is a chat room that you set up in [Amazon Q Developer in chat applications](../../../chatbot/latest/adminguide.md "../../../chatbot/latest/adminguide.md"). You then connect this
channel to a response plan in Incident Manager.

During an incident, responders use the chat channel to communicate with one another about
the incident. Incident Manager also pushes any updates and notifications about the incident directly
to the chat channel. It sends these notifications using one or more Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topics
that you specify in your chat room configuration.

Amazon Q Developer in chat applications and Incident Manager support chat channels in the following applications:

- Slack
- Microsoft Teams
- Amazon Chime
  The process for setting up a chat channel for use in your incidents consists of tasks in
  three different Amazon Web Services services.

###### Tasks

- [Task 1: Create or update Amazon SNS topics for your chat
  channel](#sns-topic "#sns-topic")
- [Task 2: Create a chat channel in Amazon Q Developer in chat applications](#chat-create "#chat-create")
- [Task 3: Add the chat channel to a response plan in
  Incident Manager](#response-plan "#response-plan")
- [Interacting through the chat channel](#chat-interact "#chat-interact")

## Task 1: Create or update Amazon SNS topics for your chat

channel

Amazon SNS is a managed service that provides message delivery from publishers to subscribers
(also known as _producers_ and _consumers_). Publishers communicate asynchronously with subscribers by sending
messages to a _topic_, which is a logical access point and
communication channel. Incident Manager uses one or more topics that you associate with a response
plan to send notifications about an incident to the incident responders.

In a response plan, you can include one or more Amazon SNS topics to incident notifications. As
a best practice, you should create an SNS topic in each AWS Region you have added to your
replication set.

###### Tip

For a more linear setup workflow, we recommend that you configure your Amazon SNS topics for
use with Incident Manager first. Once configured, you can create the chat channel.

###### To create or update Amazon SNS topics for your chat channel

1. Follow the steps in the [Creating an Amazon SNS topic](../../../sns/latest/dg/sns-create-topic.md "../../../sns/latest/dg/sns-create-topic.md") in the
   _Amazon Simple Notification Service Developer Guide_.

###### Note

After you create the topic, you edit it to update its access policy. 2. Select the topic that you created, and note or copy the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of
the topic, in a format such as
`arn:aws:sns:us-east-2:111122223333:My_SNS_topic`. 3. Choose **Edit**, and then expand the **Access
policy** section to configure additional access permissions beyond the
defaults. 4. Add the following statement to the policy's **Statement**
array:

```
{
    "Sid": "IncidentManagerSNSPublishingPermissions",
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Principal": {
        "Service": "ssm-incidents.amazonaws.com"
    },
    "Action": "SNS:Publish",
    "Resource": "`sns-topic-arn`",
    "Condition": {
        "StringEqualsIfExists": {
            "AWS:SourceAccount": "`account-id`"
        }
    }
}
```

Replace the `placeholder values` as follows:

    * `sns-topic-arn` is the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the
     topic that you created for this Region, in the format
     `arn:aws:sns:us-east-2:111122223333:My_SNS_topic`.
    * `account-id` is the ID of the AWS account that you are
     working in, such as `111122223333`.

5. Choose **Save changes**.
6. Repeat the process in each Region included in your replication set.

## Task 2: Create a chat channel in Amazon Q Developer in chat applications

You can create a chat channel in Slack, Microsoft Teams, or
Amazon Chime. You need only one chat channel for each response plan.

For your chat channels, we recommend following the principal of least privilege (not
providing users with more permissions than needed to complete their tasks). You should also
regularly review the membership of your Amazon Q Developer in chat applications chat channels. Reviews help check that only
the appropriate responders and other stakeholders have access to your chat channels.

In Slack channels and Microsoft Teams channels created in
Amazon Q Developer in chat applications, incident responders can run a number of Incident Manager CLI commands directly from the
Slack or Microsoft Teams application. For more information,
see [Interacting through the chat channel](#chat-interact "#chat-interact").

###### Important

The users you add to your chat channel must be the same contacts listed on your
escalation or response plan. You can also add additional users to chat channels, such as
stakeholders and incident observers.

For general information about Amazon Q Developer in chat applications, see [What is Amazon Q Developer in chat applications](../../../chatbot/latest/adminguide/what-is.md "../../../chatbot/latest/adminguide/what-is.md") in the
_Amazon Q Developer in chat applications Administrator Guide_.

Choose from the following applications to create your channel in:

Slack

      topics.

###### Note

Chat commands, which incident responders can use in Slack and
Microsoft Teams chat channels, are not supported in Amazon Chime.

## Task 3: Add the chat channel to a response plan in

Incident Manager

When you create or update a response plan, you can add chat channels for responders to
communicate and receive updates through.

When following the steps in [Creating a response plan](response-plans.md#response-plans-create "response-plans.md#response-plans-create"), for the section **[(Optional) Specifying an incident response chat
channel](response-plans.md#chat-channel "response-plans.md#chat-channel")**, select the channel you
want to use for incidents related to this response plan.

## Interacting through the chat channel

For channels in Slack and Microsoft Teams, Incident Manager
enables responders to interact with incidents directly from the chat channel using the
following `ssm-incidents` commands:

- [start-incident](../../../cli/latest/reference/ssm-incidents/start-incident.md "../../../cli/latest/reference/ssm-incidents/start-incident.md")
- [list-response-plan](../../../cli/latest/reference/ssm-incidents/list-response-plan.md "../../../cli/latest/reference/ssm-incidents/list-response-plan.md")
- [get-response-plan](../../../cli/latest/reference/ssm-incidents/get-response-plan.md "../../../cli/latest/reference/ssm-incidents/get-response-plan.md")
- [create-timeline-event](../../../cli/latest/reference/ssm-incidents/create-timeline-event.md "../../../cli/latest/reference/ssm-incidents/create-timeline-event.md")
- [delete-timeline-event](../../../cli/latest/reference/ssm-incidents/delete-timeline-event.md "../../../cli/latest/reference/ssm-incidents/delete-timeline-event.md")
- [get-incident-record](../../../cli/latest/reference/ssm-incidents/get-incident-record.md "../../../cli/latest/reference/ssm-incidents/get-incident-record.md")
- [get-timeline-event](../../../cli/latest/reference/ssm-incidents/get-timeline-event.md "../../../cli/latest/reference/ssm-incidents/get-timeline-event.md")
- [list-incident-records](../../../cli/latest/reference/ssm-incidents/list-incident-records.md "../../../cli/latest/reference/ssm-incidents/list-incident-records.md")
- [list-timeline-events](../../../cli/latest/reference/ssm-incidents/list-timeline-events.md "../../../cli/latest/reference/ssm-incidents/list-timeline-events.md")
- [list-related-items](../../../cli/latest/reference/ssm-incidents/list-related-items.md "../../../cli/latest/reference/ssm-incidents/list-related-items.md")
- [update-related-items](../../../cli/latest/reference/ssm-incidents/update-related-items.md "../../../cli/latest/reference/ssm-incidents/update-related-items.md")
- [update-incident-record](../../../cli/latest/reference/ssm-incidents/update-incident-record.md "../../../cli/latest/reference/ssm-incidents/update-incident-record.md")
- [update-timeline-event](../../../cli/latest/reference/ssm-incidents/update-timeline-event.md "../../../cli/latest/reference/ssm-incidents/update-timeline-event.md")

To run commands in an active incident's chat channel, use the following format. Replace
`cli-options` with any options to be included for a command.

```
@aws ssm-incidents `cli-options`
```

For example:

```
@aws ssm-incidents start-incident --response-plan-arn arn:aws:ssm-incidents::111122223333:response-plan/test-response-plan-chat --region us-east-2
```

```
@aws ssm-incidents create-timeline-event --event-data "\"example timeline event"\" --event-time 2023-03-31 T20:30:00.000  --event-type Custom Event --incident-record-arn arn:aws:ssm-incidents::111122223333:incident-record/MyResponsePlanChat/98c397e6-7c10-aa10-9b86-f199aEXAMPLE
```

```
@aws ssm-incidents list-incident-records
```
