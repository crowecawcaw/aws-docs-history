# Creating and configuring response plans in

Incident Manager

Response plans let you plan for how to respond to an incident that impacts your users.
A response plan works as a template that includes information about who to engage, the
expected severity of the event, automatic runbooks to initiate, and metrics to monitor.

###### Best practices

You can reduce the impact on incidents on your teams when you plan for incidents
ahead of time. Teams should consider the following best practices when you design a
response plan.

- **Streamlined engagement** – Identify the
  most appropriate team for an incident. If you engage too wide a distribution
  list, or if you engage the wrong teams, you can cause confusion and waste
  responder time during an incident.
- **Reliable escalation** – For your
  engagements in a response plan, we recommend selecting an engagement plan
  instead of contacts or on-call schedules. The engagement plan should specify the
  individual contacts or on-call schedules (which contain multiple rotating
  contacts) to engage during incidents. Because responders specified in your
  engagement plan can be unreachable at times, you should configure backup
  responders in your response plan to cover these scenarios. With backup contacts,
  if the primary and secondary contacts are unavailable or there are other
  unplanned gaps in coverage, Incident Manager still notifies a contact about the
  incident.
- **Runbooks** – Use runbooks to provide
  repeatable, understandable steps that reduce the stress a responder experiences
  during an incident.
- **Collaboration** – Use chat channels to
  streamline communication during incidents. Chat channels help responders stay up
  to date with information. They can also share information with other responders
  through these channels.

## Creating a response plan

Use the following procedure to create a response plan and automate incident
response.

###### To create a response plan

1. Open the [Incident Manager console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/incidents/home "https://console.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/incidents/home"), and in the navigation pane, choose
   **Response plans**.
2. Choose **Create response plan**.
3. For **Name**, enter a unique and identifiable response
   plan name to use in the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the response
   plan.
4. (Optional) For **Display name**, enter a more human
   readable name to help identify the response plan when you create
   incidents.
5. Continue by [specifying default values
   for incident records](#incident-defaults "#incident-defaults").

### Specifying incident default values

To help you manage incidents more effectively, you can specify default values.
Incident Manager applies these values to all incidents that are associated with a
response plan.

###### To specify incident default values

1. For **Title**, enter a title for this incident to
   help you identify it on the Incident Manager home page.
2. For **Impact**, choose an impact level to indicate
   the potential scope of an incidents created from this response plan,
   such as **Critical** or **Low**. For
   information about impact ratings in Incident Manager, see [Triage](incident-lifecycle.md#triage "incident-lifecycle.md#triage").
3. (Optional) For **Summary**, enter a brief summary the
   type of incidents created from this response plan.
4. (Optional) For **Dedupe string**, enter a dedupe
   string. Incident Manager uses this string to prevent the same root cause from
   creating multiple incidents in the same account.

A deduplication string is a term or phrase the system uses to check
for duplicate incidents. If you specify a deduplication string,
Incident Manager searches for open incidents that contain the same string in
the `dedupeString` field when it creates the incident. If a
duplicate is detected, Incident Manager deduplicates the newer incident into
the existing incident.

###### Note

By default, Incident Manager automatically deduplicates multiple
incidents created by the same Amazon CloudWatch alarm or Amazon EventBridge event. You
don't have to enter your own deduplication string to prevent
duplication for these resource types. 5. (Optional) Under **Incident Tags**, add tag keys and
values to assign to incidents created from this response plan.

You must have the `TagResource` permission for the incident
record resource to set incident tags within the response plan. 6. Continue by [specifying an optional chat
channel](#chat-channel "#chat-channel") for resolvers to communicate with one another about
incidents.

### (Optional) Specifying an incident response chat

channel

When you include a chat channel in a response plan, responders receive
incident updates through the channel. They can interact with the incident
directly from the chat channel by using chat commands.

Using Amazon Q Developer in chat applications, you can create a channel for Slack, for
Microsoft Teams, or for Amazon Chime to use in your response plans.
For information about creating a chat channel in Amazon Q Developer in chat applications, see the [_Amazon Q Developer in chat applications Administrator Guide_](../../../chatbot/latest/adminguide.md "../../../chatbot/latest/adminguide.md").

###### Important

Incident Manager must have permissions to publish to a chat channel's Amazon Simple Notification Service
(Amazon SNS) topic. Without permissions to publish to that SNS topic, you can't
add it to the response plan. Incident Manager publishes a test notification to
the SNS topic to verify permissions.

For more information about chat channels, see [Creating and integrating chat channels for responders in
Incident Manager](chat.md "chat.md").

###### To specify an incident response chat channel

1. For **Chat channel**, select an Amazon Q Developer in chat applications chat
   channel where responders can communicate during an incident.

###### Tip

To create a new chat channel in Amazon Q Developer in chat applications, choose
**Configure new Chatbot client**. 2. For **Chat channel SNS topics**, choose additional
SNS topics to publish to during the incident. Adding SNS topics in
multiple AWS Regions increases redundancy in case a Region is down at
the time of the incident. 3. Continue by [selecting the contacts,
on-call schedules, and escalation plans](#engagements "#engagements") to be engaged during
an incident.

### (Optional) Select resources to engage in incident

response

It's important to identify the most appropriate responders when an incident
occurs. As a best practice, we recommend that you do the following:

1. Add contacts and on-call schedules as the escalation channels in an
   escalation plan.

###### Note

Currently, the ability to add a contact that’s shared from another
account to a response plan is not supported. 2. Choose an escalation plan as the engagement in a response plan.

For more information about contacts and escalation plans, see [Creating and configuring contacts in Incident Manager](contacts.md "contacts.md") and [Creating an escalation plan for responder engagement in
Incident Manager](escalation.md "escalation.md").

###### To select resources to engage in incident response

1. For **Engagements**, choose any number of escalation
   plans, on-call schedules, and individual contacts.
2. Continue by optionally [specifying a runbook to
   run](#runbook "#runbook") as part of your incident mitigation.

### (Optional) Specifying a runbook for incident

mitigation

You can use runbooks from [AWS Systems Manager Automation](../../../systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-automation.md "../../../systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-automation.md"), a tool in AWS Systems Manager, to automate common
application and infrastructure tasks in your AWS Cloud environment.

Each runbook defines an _runbook workflow_. A
runbook workflow includes the actions that Systems Manager performs on your managed nodes
or other AWS resource types. In Incident Manager, a runbook drives incident
response and mitigation.

For more information about using runbooks in response plans, [Integrating Systems Manager Automation runbooks in Incident Manager for incident
remediation](runbooks.md "runbooks.md").

To specify a runbook for incident mitigation:

1. For **Runbook**, do one of the following:
   - Choose **Clone runbook from template** to
     make a copy of the default Incident Manager runbook. For
     **Runbook name**, enter a descriptive name
     for the new runbook.
   - Choose **Select existing runbook**. Select
     the **Owner**, **Runbook**,
     and **Version** to use.

   ###### Tip

   To create a runbook from scratch, choose
   **Configure new runbook**.

   For information about creating runbooks, see [Integrating Systems Manager Automation runbooks in Incident Manager for incident
   remediation](runbooks.md "runbooks.md").

2. In the **Parameters** area, supply any parameters
   requested for the runbook you selected.

The available parameters are those specified by the runbook. One
runbook might require different parameters than another. Some parameters
might be required and others optional.

In many cases, you can choose to manually enter a static value for a
parameter, such as a list of Amazon EC2 instance IDs. You can also let
Incident Manager provide the parameter values that were dynamically generated
by an incident. 3. (Optional) For **AutomationAssumeRole**, specify the
AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role to use. This role must have the permissions
needed to run the individual commands specified within the runbook.

###### Note

If no `AssumeRole` is specified, Incident Manager attempts
to use the Runbook service role to run the individual commands
specified within the runbook.

Choose from the following:

    * **Enter ARN value** – Manually enter
     the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an AssumeRole, in the format
     `arn:aws:iam::`account-id`:role/`assume-role-name``.
     For example,
     `arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/MyAssumeRole`.
    * **Use existing service role** – Choose
     a role with the required permissions from a list of existing
     roles in your account.
    * **Create new service role** – Choose
     from among AWS managed policies to attach to your AssumeRole.
     After selecting this option, for **AWS managed
     policies**, choose one or more policies from the
     list.


    You can accept the suggested default name for the new role, or
     enter a name that you choose.


    ###### Note

    This new Runbook service role is associated with the
     specific runbook that you selected. It can't be used with
     different runbooks. This is because the Resource section of
     the policy won't support other runbooks.

4. For **Runbook service role**, specify the IAM role
   to use to provide the permissions needed to access and start the
   workflow for the runbook itself.

At minimum, the role must allow the
`ssm:StartAutomationExecution` action for your specific
runbook. For the runbook to work across accounts, the role must also
allow the `sts:AssumeRole` action for the
`AWS-SystemsManager-AutomationExecutionRole` role that
you created during [Managing incidents across
AWS accounts and Regions in Incident Manager](incident-manager-cross-account-cross-region.md "incident-manager-cross-account-cross-region.md").

Choose from the following:

    * **Create new service role** –
     Incident Manager creates a Runbook service role for you that includes
     the minimum required permissions to start the runbook
     workflow.


    For **Role name**, you can accept the
     suggested default name, or enter a name that you choose. We
     recommend using the suggested name or keeping the name of the
     runbook in the name. This is because the new AssumeRole is
     associated with the specific runbook you selected and might not
     include the permissions required for other runbooks.
    * **Use existing service role** – An
     IAM role that you or Incident Manager created previously grants the
     needed permissions.


    For **Role name**, select the name of the
     existing role to use.

5. Expand **Additional options** and choose one of the
   following to specify the AWS account where the runbook workflow should
   run.
   - **Response plan owner's account** –
     Start the runbook workflow in the AWS account that created
     it.
   - **Impacted account** – Start the
     runbook workflow in the account that began or reported the
     incident.

   Choose **Impacted account** when you use
   Incident Manager for cross-account scenarios and the runbook needs to
   access resources in the impacted account to remediate
   them.

6. Continue by optionally [integrating a
   PagerDuty service into the response plan](#integrations "#integrations").

### (Optional) Integrating a PagerDuty service into

the response plan

###### To integrate a PagerDuty service into the response plan

When you integrate Incident Manager with PagerDuty, PagerDuty creates a
corresponding incident whenever Incident Manager creates an incident. The incident in
PagerDuty uses the paging workflow and escalation policies that you defined
there in addition to those in Incident Manager. PagerDuty attaches timeline events
from Incident Manager as notes on your incident.

1. Expand **Third-party integrations**, then choose the
   **Enable PagerDuty integration** check box.
2. For **Select secret**, select the secret in AWS Secrets Manager
   where you store the credentials to access your PagerDuty account.

For information about storing your PagerDuty credentials in a Secrets Manager
secret, see [Storing
PagerDuty access credentials in an AWS Secrets Manager secret](integrations-pagerduty-secret.md "integrations-pagerduty-secret.md"). 3. For **PagerDuty service**, select the service from your
PagerDuty account where you want to create the PagerDuty incident. 4. Continue by [adding optional tags and creating the
response plan](#tags "#tags").

### Adding tags and creating the response plan

###### To add tags and create the response plan

1. (Optional) In the **Tags** area, apply
   one or more tag key name/value pairs to the response plan.

Tags are optional metadata that you assign to a resource. With tags,
you can categorize a resource in different ways, such as by purpose,
owner, or environment. For example, you might want to tag a response
plan to identify the type of incident it is meant to mitigation, the
types of escalation channels it contains, or the escalation plan that
will be associated with it. For more information about tagging Incident
Manager resources, see [Tagging resources in Incident Manager](tagging.md "tagging.md"). 2. Choose **Create response plan**.
