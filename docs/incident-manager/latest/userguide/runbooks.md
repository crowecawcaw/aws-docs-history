# Integrating Systems Manager Automation runbooks in Incident Manager for incident

remediation

You can use runbooks from [AWS Systems Manager
Automation](../../../systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-automation.md "../../../systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-automation.md"), a tool in AWS Systems Manager, to automate common application and infrastructure
tasks in your AWS Cloud environment.

Each runbook defines a _runbook workflow_, which is composed
of the actions that Systems Manager performs on your managed nodes or other AWS resource types. You can
use runbooks to automate the maintenance, deployment, and remediation of your AWS
resources.

In Incident Manager, a runbook drives incident response and mitigation, and you specify a runbook
to use as part of a response plan.

In your response plans, you can choose from dozens of pre-configured runbooks for commonly
automated tasks, or you can create custom runbooks. When you specify a runbook in a response plan
definition, the system can automatically start the runbook when an incident starts.

###### Important

Incidents created by a cross-Region failover don't invoke runbooks specified in response plans.

## IAM permissions required to start and run runbook

workflows

Incident Manager requires permissions to run runbooks as part of your incident response. To
provide these permissions, you use AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles, the _Runbook service
role_, and the _Automation `AssumeRole`_.

The Runbook service role is a required service role. This role provides Incident Manager with the
permissions it needs to access and start the workflow for the runbook.

The Automation `AssumeRole` provides the permissions needed to run the individual
commands specified within the runbook.

###### Note

If no `AssumeRole` is specified, Systems Manager Automation attempts to use the Runbook
service role for individual commands. If you don't specify an `AssumeRole`, you must
add the necessary permissions to the Runbook service role. If you don't, the runbook fails to
run those commands.

However, as a security best practice, we recommend using a separate
`AssumeRole`. With a separate `AssumeRole`, you can limit the necessary
permissions you must add to each role.

For more information about the Automation `AssumeRole`, see [Configuring a service role (assume role) access for automations](../../../systems-manager/latest/userguide/automation-setup.md#automation-setup-configure-role "../../../systems-manager/latest/userguide/automation-setup.md#automation-setup-configure-role") ' in the
_AWS Systems Manager User Guide_.

You can create either type of role manually yourself in the IAM console.- You can also let
Incident Manager create either one for you when you create or update a response plan.

###### Runbook service role permissions

Runbook service role permissions are provided through a policy similar to the following.

The first statement allows Incident Manager to start the Systems Manager
`StartAutomationExecution` operation. This operation then runs on resources
represented by the three Amazon Resource Name (ARN) formats.

The second statement allows the Runbook service role to assume a role in another account
when that runbook runs in the impacted account. For more information, see [Running automations in multiple AWS Regions and accounts](../../../systems-manager/latest/userguide/running-automations-multiple-accounts-regions.md "../../../systems-manager/latest/userguide/running-automations-multiple-accounts-regions.md") in the
_AWS Systems Manager User Guide_.

###### Automation AssumeRole permissions

When you create or update a response plan, you can choose from several AWS managed
policies to attach to the AssumeRole that Incident Manager creates. These policies provide
permissions to run a number of common operations used in Incident Manager runbook scenarios. You can
choose one or more of these managed policies to provide permissions for your
`AssumeRole` policy. The following table describes the policies that you can
choose from when you create an `AssumeRole` from the Incident Manager console.

| AWS managed policy name            | Policy description                                                                                                                                                         |
| ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `AmazonSSMAutomationRole`          | Grants permissions for the Systems Manager Automation service to run activities defined within<br>runbooks. Assign this policy to administrators and trusted power users.  |
| `AWSIncidentManagerResolverAccess` | Grants permission for users to start, view, and update incidents. You can also use them<br>to create customer timeline events and related items in the incident dashboard. |

You can use these managed policies to grant permissions for many common incident response
scenarios. However, the permissions required for the specific tasks you need can vary. In these
cases, you need to provide additional policy permissions for your `AssumeRole`. For
information, see the _[AWS Systems Manager Automation runbook reference](../../../systems-manager-automation-runbooks/latest/userguide/automation-runbook-reference.md "../../../systems-manager-automation-runbooks/latest/userguide/automation-runbook-reference.md")_.

## Working with runbook parameters

When you add a runbook to a response plan, you can specify the parameters the runbook should
use at runtime. Response plans support parameters with both static and dynamic values. For static
values, you enter the value when you define the parameter in the response plan. For dynamic
values, the system determines the correct parameter value by collecting information from the
incident. Incident Manager supports the following dynamic parameters:

`Incident ARN`

When Incident Manager creates an incident, the system captures the Amazon Resource Name (ARN)
of the corresponding incident record and enters it for this parameter in the runbook.

###### Note

This value can only be assigned to parameters of type `String`. If assigned
to a parameter of any other type, the runbook fails to run.

`Involved resources`

When Incident Manager creates an incident, the system captures the ARNs of the resources
involved in the incident. These resource ARNs are then assigned to this parameter in the
runbook.

### About associated resources

Incident Manager can populate runbook parameter values with the ARNs of AWS resources
specified in CloudWatch alarms, EventBridge events, and manually created incidents. This section describes
the different types of resources for which Incident Manager can capture ARNs when populating this
parameter.

###### CloudWatch alarms

When an incident is created from a CloudWatch alarm action, Incident Manager automatically extracts
the following types of resources from the associated metrics. It then populates the chosen
parameters with the following involved resources:

| AWS service                                     | Resource type                                      |
| ----------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Amazon DynamoDB                                 | Global secondary indexes<br>Streams<br>Tables      |
| Amazon EC2                                      | Images<br>Instances                                |
| AWS Lambda                                      | Function aliases<br>Function versions<br>Functions |
| Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) | Clusters<br>Database instances                     |
| Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3)       | Buckets                                            |

###### EventBridge rules

When the system creates an incident from an EventBridge event, Incident Manager populates the chosen
parameters with the `Resources` property in the event. For more information, see
[Amazon EventBridge
events](../../../eventbridge/latest/userguide/eb-events.md "../../../eventbridge/latest/userguide/eb-events.md") in the _Amazon EventBridge User Guide_.

###### Manually created incidents

When you create an incident by using the [StartIncident](../APIReference/API_StartIncident.md "../APIReference/API_StartIncident.md") API
action, Incident Manager populates the chosen parameters by using information in the API call.
Specifically, it populates parameters by using items of the type `INVOLVED_RESOURCE`
that are passed in the `relatedItems` parameter.

###### Note

The `INVOLVED_RESOURCES` value can only be assigned to parameters of type
`StringList`. If assigned to a parameter of any other type, the runbook fails to
run.

## Define a runbook

When creating a runbook, you can follow the steps provided here, or you can follow the more
detailed guide provided in the [Working with runbooks](../../../systems-manager/latest/userguide/automation-documents.md "../../../systems-manager/latest/userguide/automation-documents.md")
section in the _Systems Manager User Guide_. If you're creating a multi-account,
multi-Region runbook, see [Running automations in multiple AWS Regions and accounts](../../../systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-automation-multiple-accounts-and-regions.md "../../../systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-automation-multiple-accounts-and-regions.md") in the _Systems Manager User
Guide_.

###### Define a runbook

1. Open the Systems Manager console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/ "https://console.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/").
2. In the navigation pane, choose **Documents**.
3. Choose **Create automation**.
4. Enter a unique and identifiable runbook name.
5. Enter a description of the runbook.
6. Provide an IAM role for the automation document to assume. This allows the runbook to
   run commands automatically. For more information, see [Configuring a service role access for Automation workflows](../../../systems-manager/latest/userguide/automation-setup.md#automation-setup-configure-role "../../../systems-manager/latest/userguide/automation-setup.md#automation-setup-configure-role").
7. (Optional) Add any input parameters that the runbook starts with. You can use dynamic or
   static parameters when starting a runbook. Dynamic parameters use values from the incident that
   the runbook is started in. Static parameters use the value you provide.
8. (Optional) Add a **Target** type.
9. (Optional) Add tags.
10. Fill in the steps that the runbook will take when it runs. Each step requires:
    - A name.
    - A description of the purpose of the step.
    - The action to run during the step. Runbooks use the **Pause** action
      type to describe a manual step.
    - (Optional) Command properties.

11. After adding all required runbook steps, choose **Create
    Automation**.

To enable cross-account functionality, share the runbook in your management account with all
application accounts that use the runbook during an incident.

###### Share a runbook

1. Open the Systems Manager console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/ "https://console.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/").
2. In the navigation pane, choose **Documents**.
3. In the documents list, choose the document you want to share and then choose
   **View details**. On the **Permissions** tab, verify that
   you're the document owner. Only a document owner can share a document.
4. Choose **Edit**.
5. To share the command publicly, choose **Public** and then choose
   **Save**. To share the command privately, choose
   **Private**, enter the AWS account ID, choose **Add
   permission**, and then choose **Save**.
