1. Users upload images from wafer inspection to an **Amazon Simple Storage Service** (Amazon S3) bucket through a web user interface (UI) using transfer
   acceleration.
2. **Amazon S3** calls an **AWS Lambda** function, logging the new image location in an **DynamoDB** table.
3. The web interface calls an **Amazon API Gateway**
   instance with the images metadata, which is stored in **Amazon DynamoDB** by a second **Lambda** function.
4. The **Lambda** function calls **Amazon SageMaker AI** for inference. Amazon Elastic Inference lowers the cost of
   inference by only attaching a graphics processing unit (GPU) when data needs to be
   processed.
5. The **Lambda** function adds the Inference results to the
   **Amazon DynamoDB** table.
6. Users are notified in the UI of detected defects. The UI fetches the image and
   metadata of the defected wafer from **Amazon API Gateway**. Wafers without defects move faster to the next
   step.
7. To accelerate user access to the image and inference results **Amazon CloudFront** caches both static content and API calls.
8. **Amazon S3** lifecycle policies move older images to cold
   storage for cost optimization.
9. Images analyzed by engineers are added to the next model-training datasets to improve inference accuracy.
