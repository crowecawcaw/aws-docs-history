# Troubleshooting Amazon DevOps Guru identity and

access

Use the following information to help you diagnose and fix common issues that you might
encounter when working with DevOps Guru and IAM.

  perform an action in DevOps Guru](#security_iam_troubleshoot-no-permissions "#security_iam_troubleshoot-no-permissions")
- [I want to give users programmatic access](#security_iam_troubleshoot-keys "#security_iam_troubleshoot-keys")

## I am not authorized to

perform an action in DevOps Guru

If the AWS Management Console tells you that you're not authorized to perform an action, then
you must contact your administrator for assistance.

The following example error occurs when the user `mateojackson`
tries to use the console to view details about a fictional
`my-example-widget` resource but does
not have the fictional
`aws:`GetWidget``
permissions.

```
User: arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/mateojackson is not authorized to perform: aws:`GetWidget` on resource: `my-example-widget`
```

In this case, Mateo asks his administrator to update his policies to allow him to
access the `my-example-widget` resource using
the `aws:`GetWidget`` action.

## I want to give users programmatic access

Users need programmatic access if they want to interact with AWS outside of the AWS Management Console. The way to grant programmatic access depends on the type of user that's accessing AWS.

To grant users programmatic access, choose one of the following options.

| Which user needs programmatic access?                        | To                                                                                                                                  | By                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

## I am not authorized to perform

iam:PassRole

If you receive an error that you're not authorized to perform the `iam:PassRole` action, your policies must be updated to allow you to pass a role to DevOps Guru.

Some AWS services allow you to pass an existing role to that service instead of creating a new service role or service-linked role. To do
this, you must have permissions to pass the role to the service.

The following example error occurs when an IAM user named `marymajor` tries to use the console to perform an action in
DevOps Guru. However, the action requires the service to have permissions that are granted by a service role. Mary does not have permissions to pass the
role to the service.

```
User: arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/`marymajor` is not authorized to perform: iam:PassRole
```

In this case, Mary's policies must be updated to allow her to perform the `iam:PassRole` action.

If you need help, contact your AWS administrator. Your administrator is the person who provided you with your sign-in credentials.

## I want to allow

people outside of my AWS account to access my DevOps Guru resources

You can create a role that users in other accounts or people outside of your organization can use to access your resources. You can specify who
is trusted to assume the role. For services that support resource-based policies or access control lists (ACLs), you can use those policies to grant
people access to your resources.

To learn more, consult the following:

- To learn whether DevOps Guru supports these features, see [How Amazon DevOps Guru works with
  IAM](security_iam_service-with-iam.md "security_iam_service-with-iam.md").
- To learn how to provide access to your resources across AWS accounts that you own, see [Providing access to an IAM user in another AWS account that you
  own](../../../IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_common-scenarios_aws-accounts.md "../../../IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_common-scenarios_aws-accounts.md") in the _IAM User Guide_.
- To learn how to provide access to your resources to third-party AWS accounts, see [Providing access to AWS accounts owned by third parties](../../../IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_common-scenarios_third-party.md "../../../IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_common-scenarios_third-party.md") in the
  _IAM User Guide_.
- To learn how to provide access through identity federation, see [Providing access to externally authenticated users (identity federation)](../../../IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_common-scenarios_federated-users.md "../../../IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_common-scenarios_federated-users.md") in the _IAM User Guide_.
- To learn the difference between using roles and resource-based policies for cross-account access, see [Cross account resource access in IAM](../../../IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies-cross-account-resource-access.md "../../../IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies-cross-account-resource-access.md") in the
