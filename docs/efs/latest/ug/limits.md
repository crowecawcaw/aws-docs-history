## Amazon EFS quotas that you can increase

Service Quotas is an AWS service that helps you manage your quotas, or limits, from one
location. In the [Service Quotas console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/home?region=us-east-1#!/dashboard "https://console.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/home?region=us-east-1#!/dashboard"), you can view Amazon EFS limit values and request a quota increase for
the number of EFS ﬁle systems in an AWS Region and the read IOPS for frequently
accessed data.

You can also request an increase for the following Amazon EFS quotas by contacting AWS
Support. To learn more, see [Requesting a quota increase](#request-limit-increase "#request-limit-increase"). The Amazon EFS service team reviews each request
individually.

- Number of file systems for each customer account.
- Number of access points for each file system.
- Maximum read IOPS per file system using Elastic throughput. When the
  read IOPS for frequently accessed file systems is increased, both the read IOPS for
  infrequently accessed file systems and the write IOPS are also increased.
- Elastic throughput per Regional file system for all
  connected clients in an AWS Region.
- Provisioned throughput per Regional file system for all
  connected clients in an AWS Region.

The following table lists general default resource quotas that you can request to
change.

   necessary fields in the form, and then choose your preferred method of contact.

## Amazon EFS resource quotas that you

cannot change

Quotas for several Amazon EFS resources cannot be changed, including:

- Quotas for general resources, such as the number of connections for each file system.
- Elastic and Provisioned throughput quotas per
  One Zone file system for all connected clients in an AWS Region.
- Bursting throughput quotas per Regional or
  One Zone file system for all connected clients in an AWS Region.

The following table lists the general resource quotas that cannot be changed.

| General resource quotas that cannot be changed                       | Resource | Quota |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- | ----- |
| Number of connections for each file system                           | 25,000   |
| Number of mount targets for each file system in an Availability Zone | 1        |
| Number of mount targets for each virtual private cloud (VPC)         | 1,400    |
| Number of security groups for each mount target                      | 5        |
| Number of tags for each file system                                  | 50       |
| Number of VPCs for each file system                                  | 1        |

###### Note

Clients can also connect to mount targets that are in an account or VPC that is different from that of the file system. For more
information, see [Mounting EFS file systems from
another AWS account or VPC](manage-fs-access-vpc-peering.md "manage-fs-access-vpc-peering.md").

The following table lists the total default Elastic and Provisioned
throughput limits per file system for all connected clients in each AWS Region.

One Zone file systems – Total default Elastic and
Provisioned throughput per file system for all connected clients in each
AWS Region| AWS Region | Maximum read throughput | Maximum write throughput (metered throughput) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| All AWS Regions | 3 GiBps | 1 GiBps |

The following table lists the total Bursting throughput limits per file
system for all connected clients in each AWS Region.

Regional and
One Zone file systems – Total Bursting throughput per file system
for all connected clients in each AWS Region| AWS Region | Maximum read throughput | Maximum write throughput |
| --- | --- | --- |
| US East (Ohio) Region<br>US East (N. Virginia) Region<br>US West (Oregon) Region<br>Asia Pacific (Sydney) Region<br>Europe (Ireland) Region | 5 GiBps | 3 GiBps |
| All other AWS Regions | 3 GiBps | 1 GiBps |

## Quotas for NFS clients

The following quotas for NFS clients apply, assuming a Linux NFSv4.1 client:

- Maximum combined read and write throughput is 1,500 mebibytes per second (MiBps) for
  file systems using Elastic throughput and mounted using version 2.0 or later
  of the Amazon EFS client (amazon-efs-utils version) or the Amazon EFS CSI Driver
  (aws-efs-csi-driver). Maximum throughput for all other file systems is 500 MiBps. For more
  information about performance, see [Performance summary](performance.md#performance-overview "performance.md#performance-overview"). NFS client throughput is calculated as the total
  number of bytes that are sent and received, with a minimum NFS request size of 4 KB (after
  applying a 1/3 metering rate for read requests).
- Up to 65,536 active users for each client can have files open at the same time.
- Up to 65,536 files open at the same time on the instance. Listing directory contents
  doesn't count as opening a file.
- Each unique mount on the client can acquire up to a total of 65,536 locks per connection.
- When connecting to Amazon EFS, NFS clients located on-premises or in another AWS Region
  can observe lower throughput than when connecting to EFS from the same
  AWS Region. This effect is because of increased network latency. Network latency of 1 ms
  or less is required to achieve maximum per-client throughput. Use the DataSync data migration
  service when migrating large datasets from on-premises NFS servers to EFS.
- The NFS protocol supports a maximum of 16 group IDs (GIDs) per user and any additional GIDs
  are truncated from NFS client requests. For more information, see [Access denied to allowed files on NFS file system](troubleshooting-efs-general.md#nfs-16-group-limit "troubleshooting-efs-general.md#nfs-16-group-limit").
- Using Amazon EFS with Microsoft Windows isn't supported.

## Quotas for Amazon EFS file systems

The following quotas are specific to Amazon EFS file systems.

| Resource                                                        | Quota                               |
| --------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| File name length, in bytes                                      | 255                                 |
| Symbolic link (symlink) length, in bytes                        | 4,080                               |
| Number of hard links to a file                                  | 177                                 |
| Size of a single file                                           | 52,673,613,135,872 bytes (47.9 TiB) |
| Number of levels for directory depth                            | 1,000                               |
| Number of locks on a single file across all instances and users | 512                                 |
| Character limit for each file system policy                     | 20,000                              |
| \*Number of file operations per second for General Purpose mode | 250,000                             |

\*For more information about the number of file operations per second for General Purpose
mode, see [Performance summary](performance.md#performance-overview "performance.md#performance-overview").

## Unsupported NFSv4.0 and 4.1 features

Although Amazon EFS doesn't support NFSv2, or NFSv3, it does support both NFSv4.1 and
NFSv4.0, except for the following features:

- pNFS
- Exended attributes
- Client delegation or callbacks of any type
  - Operation OPEN always returns `OPEN_DELEGATE_NONE` as the delegation
    type.
  - The operation OPEN returns `NFSERR_NOTSUPP` for the
    `CLAIM_DELEGATE_CUR` and `CLAIM_DELEGATE_PREV` claim
    types.

- Mandatory locking

All locks in Amazon EFS are advisory, which means that read and write operations don't
check for conflicting locks before the operation is executed.

- Deny share

NFS supports the concept of a share deny. A _share deny_ is primarily used by Windows clients for users to deny others access to a
particular file that has been opened. Amazon EFS doesn't support this, and returns the NFS
error `NFS4ERR_NOTSUPP` for any OPEN commands specifying a share deny value
other than `OPEN4_SHARE_DENY_NONE`. Linux NFS clients don't use anything
other than `OPEN4_SHARE_DENY_NONE`.

- Access control lists (ACLs)
- Amazon EFS doesn't update the `time_access` attribute on file reads. Amazon EFS
  updates `time_access` in the following events:
  - When a file is created (an inode is created)
  - When an NFS client makes an explicit `setattr` call
  - On a write to the inode caused by, for example, file size changes or file metadata
    changes
  - Any inode attribute is updated

- Namespaces
- Persistent reply cache
- Kerberos based security
- NFSv4.1 data retention
- SetUID on directories
- Unsupported file types when using the CREATE operation: Block devices (NF4BLK),
  character devices (NF4CHR), attribute directory (NF4ATTRDIR), and named attribute
  (NF4NAMEDATTR).
- Unsupported attributes: FATTR4_ARCHIVE, FATTR4_FILES_AVAIL, FATTR4_FILES_FREE,
  FATTR4_FILES_TOTAL, FATTR4_FS_LOCATIONS, FATTR4_MIMETYPE, FATTR4_QUOTA_AVAIL_HARD,
  FATTR4_QUOTA_AVAIL_SOFT, FATTR4_QUOTA_USED, FATTR4_TIME_BACKUP, and FATTR4_ACL.

An attempt to set these attributes results in an `NFS4ERR_ATTRNOTSUPP`
error that is sent back to the client.

## Additional considerations

In addition, note the following:

- For a list of AWS Regions where you can create Amazon EFS file systems, see the [AWS General Reference User Guide](../../../general/latest/gr/Welcome.md "../../../general/latest/gr/Welcome.md").
- Amazon EFS does not support the `nconnect` mount option.
- You can mount an Amazon EFS file system from on-premises data center servers using Direct Connect
  and VPN. For more information, see [Tutorial: Mounting with
  on-premises clients](mounting-fs-mount-helper-direct.md "mounting-fs-mount-helper-direct.md").
