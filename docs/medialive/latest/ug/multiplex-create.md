# Creating a multiplex and program

A MediaLive multiplex provides configuration information for an MPTS, including the bitrate of
the entire MPTS.

You can create a multiplex from scratch, or you can clone an existing multiplex. Cloning a
multiplex is similar to cloning a channel—the values in most of the fields are copied to the
new multiplex.

You can create a program inside a multiplex. You can't create a program without attaching
it to a multiplex.

###### To create a multiplex

1. Open the MediaLive console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/medialive/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/medialive/ "https://console.aws.amazon.com/medialive/").
2. In the navigation pane, choose **Multiplexes**.
3. On the **Multiplexes** page, choose **Create**.
4. Complete the fields on the **Create multiplex** page.
5. Choose **Create**.

The multiplex is added to the **Multiplexes** page. After the status
of the multiplex changes to IDLE, your next step is to add programs to the multiplex. For
more information, see later in this section.

###### To create a multiplex by cloning

1. Open the MediaLive console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/medialive/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/medialive/ "https://console.aws.amazon.com/medialive/").
2. In the navigation pane, choose **Multiplexes**, and then choose the
   multiplex that you want to clone.
3. On the **Details** pane, choose **Multiplex
   actions**, and then choose **Clone**.

###### To create a program

1. Open the MediaLive console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/medialive/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/medialive/ "https://console.aws.amazon.com/medialive/").
2. In the navigation pane, choose **Multiplexes**, and then choose the
   multiplex where you want to add the program.
3. On the **Details** pane, choose the **Programs**
   tab.
4. Choose **Create program**.
5. Complete the fields on the **Create program** page.
6. Choose **Create**.

The **Program** details pane appears for this program. Note that the
channel state always specifies CHANNEL MISSING. 7. Either now or later, you must create a channel for this program:

    * You can choose **Create channel** to immediately add a channel to
     this program.
    * You can add a channel later, in the same way that you create a channel that isn't
     part of a multiplex.

The channel attached to a program is a regular channel in which the output group is always
a multiplex output group.

For information about special steps for completing the fields in a channel in a multiplex,
see [Create the channels](setting-up-multiplex.md#create-multiplex-channels-step "setting-up-multiplex.md#create-multiplex-channels-step").
