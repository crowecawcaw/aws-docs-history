**This page is only for existing customers of the Amazon Glacier service using Vaults and the original REST API from 2012.**

If you're looking for archival storage solutions, we recommend using the Amazon Glacier storage classes in Amazon S3, S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval, S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval, and S3 Glacier Deep Archive. To learn more about these storage options, see [Amazon Glacier storage classes](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/storage-classes/glacier/ "https://aws.amazon.com/s3/storage-classes/glacier/").

Amazon Glacier (original standalone vault-based service) will no longer accept new customers starting December 15, 2025, with no impact to existing customers. Amazon Glacier is a standalone service with its own APIs that stores data in vaults and is distinct from Amazon S3 and the Amazon S3 Glacier storage classes. Your existing data will remain secure and accessible in Amazon Glacier indefinitely. No migration is required. For low-cost, long-term archival storage, AWS recommends the [Amazon S3 Glacier storage classes](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/storage-classes/glacier/ "https://aws.amazon.com/s3/storage-classes/glacier/"), which deliver a superior customer experience with S3 bucket-based APIs, full AWS Region availability, lower costs, and AWS service integration. If you want enhanced capabilities, consider migrating to Amazon S3 Glacier storage classes by using our [AWS Solutions Guidance for transferring data from Amazon Glacier vaults to Amazon S3 Glacier storage classes](https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/guidance/data-transfer-from-amazon-s3-glacier-vaults-to-amazon-s3/ "https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/guidance/data-transfer-from-amazon-s3-glacier-vaults-to-amazon-s3/").

# Troubleshooting Amazon Glacier identity and

access

Use the following information to help you diagnose and fix common issues that you might
encounter when working with Amazon Glacier and IAM.

  perform an action in Amazon Glacier](#security_iam_troubleshoot-no-permissions "#security_iam_troubleshoot-no-permissions")
- [I am not authorized to perform
  iam:PassRole](#security_iam_troubleshoot-passrole "#security_iam_troubleshoot-passrole")

## I am not authorized to

perform an action in Amazon Glacier

If you receive an error that you're not authorized to perform an action, your
policies must be updated to allow you to perform the action.

The following example error occurs when the `mateojackson` IAM user
tries to use the console to view details about a fictional
`my-example-widget` resource but doesn't
have the fictional `glacier:`GetWidget`` permissions.

```
User: arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/mateojackson is not authorized to perform: glacier:GetWidget on resource: my-example-widget
```

In this case, the policy for the `mateojackson` user must be updated to allow access to the
`my-example-widget` resource by using the
`glacier:`GetWidget`` action.

If you need help, contact your AWS administrator. Your administrator is the person who provided you with your sign-in credentials.

## I am not authorized to perform

iam:PassRole

If you receive an error that you're not authorized to perform the `iam:PassRole` action, your policies must be updated to allow you to pass a role to Amazon Glacier.

Some AWS services allow you to pass an existing role to that service instead of creating a new service role or service-linked role. To do
this, you must have permissions to pass the role to the service.

The following example error occurs when an IAM user named `marymajor` tries to use the console to perform an action in
Amazon Glacier. However, the action requires the service to have permissions that are granted by a service role. Mary does not have permissions to pass the
role to the service.

```
User: arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/`marymajor` is not authorized to perform: iam:PassRole
```

In this case, Mary's policies must be updated to allow her to perform the `iam:PassRole` action.

If you need help, contact your AWS administrator. Your administrator is the person who provided you with your sign-in credentials.

## I want to allow people

outside of my AWS account to access my Amazon Glacier resources

You can create a role that users in other accounts or people outside of your organization can use to access your resources. You can specify who
is trusted to assume the role. For services that support resource-based policies or access control lists (ACLs), you can use those policies to grant
people access to your resources.
