# How do I manage IAM?

Managing AWS Identity and Access Management within an AWS environment involves leveraging a variety of tools and
interfaces. The most common method is through the AWS Management Console, a web-based interface that
allows you to perform a wide range of IAM administrative tasks, from creating users and
roles to configuring permissions.

For users more comfortable with command line interfaces, AWS provides two sets of
command line tools - the AWS Command Line Interface and the AWS Tools for Windows PowerShell. These allow you to issue IAM-related
commands directly from the terminal, often more efficiently than navigating the console.
Additionally, AWS CloudShell enables you to run CLI or SDK commands directly from your web
browser, using the permissions associated with your console sign-in.

Beyond the console and command line, AWS offers Software Development Kits (SDKs) for
various programming languages, enabling you to integrate IAM management functionality
directly into your applications. Alternatively, you can access IAM programmatically using
the IAM Query API, which allows you to issue HTTPS requests directly to the service.
Leveraging these different management approaches provides you with the flexibility to
incorporate IAM into your existing workflows and processes.

## Use the AWS Management Console

The AWS Management Console is a web application that comprises and refers to a broad
collection of service consoles for managing AWS resources. When you first sign in, you
see the console home page. The home page provides access to each service console and
offers a single place to access the information for performing your AWS related tasks.
Which services and applications are available to you after signing in to the console
depend on which AWS resources you have permission to access. You can be granted
permissions to resources either through assuming a role, being a member of a group that
has been granted permissions, or being explicitly granted permission. For a stand-alone
AWS account, the root user or IAM administrator configures access to resources. For
AWS Organizations, the management account or delegated administrator configures access to
resources.

If you plan to have people using the AWS Management Console to manage AWS
resources, we recommend configuring users with temporary credentials as a security [best practice](best-practices.md "best-practices.md"). IAM users that have assumed a role,
federated principals, and users in IAM Identity Center have temporary credentials, while the IAM user and
root user have long-term credentials. Root user credentials provide full access to
the AWS account, while other users have credentials that provide access to the
resources granted them by IAM policies.

The sign-in experience is different for the different types of AWS Management Console users.

- IAM users and the root user sign-in from the main AWS sign-in URL
  (https://signin.aws.amazon.com). Once they sign in they have access to the
  resources in the account to which they have been granted permission.

To sign in as the root user you must have the root user email address and
password.

To sign in as an IAM user you must have the AWS account number or alias,
the IAM user name, and the IAM user password.

We recommend that you restrict IAM users in your account to specific
situations that require long-term credentials, such as for emergency access, and
that you use the root user only for [tasks that
require root user credentials](id_root-user.md#root-user-tasks "id_root-user.md#root-user-tasks").

For convenience, the AWS sign-in page uses a browser cookie to remember the IAM user
name and account information. The next time the user goes to any page in the AWS Management Console, the
console uses the cookie to redirect the user to the account sign-in page.

Sign out of the console when you finish your session to prevent reuse of your
previous sign in.

- IAM Identity Center users sign in using a specific AWS access portal that's unique to their
  organization. Once they sign in they can choose which account or application to
  access. If they choose to access an account, they choose which permission set
  they want to use for the management session.
- OIDC and SAML federated principals managed in an external identity provider linked to an
  AWS account sign-in using a custom enterprise access portal. The AWS
  resources available to users are dependent upon the policies selected
  by their organization.

###### Note

To provide an additional level of security, root user, IAM users, and
users in IAM Identity Center can have multi-factor authentication (MFA) verified by AWS before
granting access to AWS resources. When MFA is enabled, you must also have access
to the MFA device to sign in.

To learn more about how different users sign-in to the management console, see [Sign in to the AWS Management Console](../../../signin/latest/userguide/console-sign-in-tutorials.md "../../../signin/latest/userguide/console-sign-in-tutorials.md") in the _AWS Sign-In User
Guide_.

## AWS Command Line Tools

You can use the AWS command line tools to issue commands at your system's command
line to perform IAM and AWS tasks. Using the command line can be faster and more
convenient than the console. The command line tools are also useful if you want to build
scripts that perform AWS tasks.

AWS provides two sets of command line tools: the [AWS Command Line Interface](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/ "https://aws.amazon.com/cli/") (AWS CLI) and the [AWS Tools for Windows PowerShell](https://aws.amazon.com/powershell/ "https://aws.amazon.com/powershell/"). For information about installing and using the AWS CLI, see the
[AWS Command Line Interface User Guide](../../../cli/latest/userguide.md "../../../cli/latest/userguide.md"). For information about installing and using the Tools for Windows PowerShell, see the
[AWS Tools for PowerShell User Guide](../../../powershell/latest/userguide.md "../../../powershell/latest/userguide.md").

After signing in to the console, you can use AWS CloudShell from your browser to run CLI or
SDK commands. The permissions for accessing AWS resources are based on the credentials
you used to sign-in to the console. Depending on your experience, you may find the CLI
to be a more efficient method of managing your AWS account. For more information, see
[Use AWS CloudShell to work with AWS Identity and Access Management](using-aws-with-cloudshell.md "using-aws-with-cloudshell.md")

### AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) and

Software Development Kits (SDKs)

IAM Identity Center and IAM users use different methods to authenticate their credentials when
they authenticate through the CLI or the application interfaces (APIs) in the
associated SDKs.

Credentials and configuration settings are located in multiple places, such as the
system or user environment variables, local AWS configuration files, or explicitly
declared on the command line as a parameter. Certain locations take precedence over
others.

Both IAM Identity Center and IAM provide access keys that can be used with the CLI or SDK.
IAM Identity Center access keys are temporary credentials that can be automatically refreshed and
are recommended over the long-term access keys associated with IAM users.

To manage your AWS account using the CLI or SDK you can use AWS CloudShell from your
browser. If you use CloudShell to run CLI or SDK commands you must first sign-in
to the console. The permissions for accessing AWS resources are based on the
credentials you used to sign-in to the console. Depending on your experience, you
may find the CLI to be a more efficient method of managing your
AWS account.

For application development, you can download the CLI or SDK to your computer and
sign-in from the command prompt or a Docker window. In this scenario, you configure
authentication and access credentials as part of the CLI script or SDK application.
You can configure programmatic access to resources in different ways, depending on
the environment and the access available to you.

- Recommended options for authenticating local code with AWS service are
  IAM Identity Center and IAM Roles Anywhere
- Recommended options for authenticating code running within an AWS
  environment are to use IAM roles or use IAM Identity Center credentials.

When signing in using the AWS access portal, you can get short-term credentials from the
start page where you choose your permission set. These credentials have a
defined duration and don't automatically refresh. If you want to use these
credentials, after signing in to the AWS portal, choose the AWS account and then
choose the permissions set. Select **Command line or programmatic
access** to view the options you can use to access AWS resources
programmatically or from the CLI. For more information about these methods, see
[Getting and refreshing temporary credentials](../../../singlesignon/latest/userguide/howtogetcredentials.md#how-to-get-temp-credentials "../../../singlesignon/latest/userguide/howtogetcredentials.md#how-to-get-temp-credentials") in the _IAM Identity Center
User Guide_. These credentials are often used during application
development to quickly test code.

We recommend using IAM Identity Center credentials that automatically refresh when automating
access to your AWS resources. If you have configured users and permission sets in
IAM Identity Center you use the `aws configure sso` command to use a command-line
wizard that will help you identify the credentials available to you and store them
in a profile. For more information about configuring your profile, see [Configure your profile with the `aws configure sso` wizard](../../../cli/latest/userguide/sso-configure-profile-token.md#sso-configure-profile-token-auto-sso "../../../cli/latest/userguide/sso-configure-profile-token.md#sso-configure-profile-token-auto-sso")
in the _AWS Command Line Interface User Guide for Version
2_.

###### Note

Many sample applications use long-term access keys associated with IAM users
or root user. You should only use long-term credentials within a sandbox
environment as part of a learning exercise. Review the [alternatives
to long-term access keys](security-creds-programmatic-access.md#security-creds-alternatives-to-long-term-access-keys "security-creds-programmatic-access.md#security-creds-alternatives-to-long-term-access-keys") and plan to transition your code to use
alternative credentials, such as IAM Identity Center credentials or IAM roles, as soon as
possible. After transitioning your code, delete the access keys.

To learn more about configuring the CLI, see [Install or update the
latest version of the AWS CLI](../../../cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.md "../../../cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.md") in the _AWS Command Line
Interface User Guide for Version 2_ and [Authentication and
access credentials](../../../cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-authentication.md "../../../cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-authentication.md") in the _AWS Command Line Interface User
Guide_

To learn more about configuring the SDK, see [IAM Identity Center authentication](../../../sdkref/latest/guide/access-sso.md "../../../sdkref/latest/guide/access-sso.md") in the
_AWS SDKs and Tools Reference Guide_ and [IAM
Roles Anywhere](../../../sdkref/latest/guide/access-rolesanywhere.md "../../../sdkref/latest/guide/access-rolesanywhere.md") in the _AWS SDKs and Tools Reference
Guide_.

## Use the AWS SDKs

AWS provides SDKs (software development kits) that consist of libraries and sample
code for various programming languages and platforms (Java, Python, Ruby, .NET, iOS,
Android, etc.). The SDKs provide a convenient way to create programmatic access to IAM
and AWS. For example, the SDKs take care of tasks such as cryptographically signing
requests, managing errors, and retrying requests automatically. For information about
the AWS SDKs, including how to download and install them, see the [Tools for Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/tools/ "https://aws.amazon.com/tools/") page.

## Use the IAM Query API

You can access IAM and AWS programmatically by using the IAM Query API, which
lets you issue HTTPS requests directly to the service. When you use the Query API, you
must include code to digitally sign requests using your credentials. For more
information, see [Calling the IAM API using HTTP query requests](programming.md "programming.md") and the
[IAM API Reference](../APIReference.md "../APIReference.md").
