# How IAM works

AWS Identity and Access Management provides the infrastructure necessary to control authentication and authorization
for your AWS account.

First, a human user or an application uses their sign-in credentials to authenticate with
AWS. IAM matches the sign-in credentials to a principal (an IAM user, AWS STS federated user principal,
IAM role, or application) trusted by the AWS account and authenticates permission to access
AWS.

Next, IAM makes a request to grant the principal access to resources. IAM grants or
denies access in response to an authorization request. For example, when you first sign in to
the console and are on the console Home page, you aren't accessing a specific service. When you
select a service, you send an authorization request to IAM for that service. IAM verifies
that your identity is on the list of authorized users, determines what policies control the
level of access granted, and evaluates any other policies that might be in effect. Principals
within your AWS account or from another AWS account that you trust can make authorization
requests.

Once authorized, the principal can perform actions or operations on resources in your
AWS account. For example, the principal could launch a new Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud instance, modify
IAM group membership, or delete Amazon Simple Storage Service buckets. The following diagram illustrates
this process through the IAM infrastructure:

## Components of a request

When a principal tries to use the AWS Management Console, the AWS API, or the AWS CLI, that principal
sends a _request_ to AWS. The request includes the following
information:

- **Actions or operations** – The actions or
  operations that the principal wants to perform., such as an action in the AWS Management Console, or an
  operation in the AWS CLI or AWS API.
- **Resources** – The AWS resource object upon
  which the principal requests to perform an action or operation.
- **Principal** – The person or application that
  used an entity (user or role) to send the request. Information about the principal
  includes the permission policies.
- **Environment data** – Information about the IP
  address, user agent, SSL enabled status, and the timestamp.
- **Resource data** – Data related to the resource
  requested, such as a DynamoDB table name or a tag on an Amazon EC2 instance.

AWS gathers the request information into a _request context_, which
IAM evaluates to authorize the request.

## How principals are authenticated

A principal signs in to AWS using their credentials which IAM authenticates to permit
the principal to send a request to AWS. Some services, such as Amazon S3 and AWS STS, allow
specific requests from anonymous users. However, they're the exception to the rule. Each type
of user goes through authentication.

- **Root user** – Your sign in credentials
  used for authentication are the email address you used to create the AWS account and the
  password you specified at that time.
- **Federated principal** – Your identity provider
  authenticates you and passes your credentials to AWS, you don't have to sign-in directly
  to AWS. Both IAM Identity Center and IAM support identity federation.
- **Users in AWS IAM Identity Center directory\***(not
  federated)\*– Users created directly in the IAM Identity Center default directory sign
  in using the AWS access portal and provide your username and password.
- **IAM user** – You sign-in by providing your
  account ID or alias, your username, and password. To authenticate workloads from the API
  or AWS CLI, you might use temporary credentials through assuming a role or you might use
  long-term credentials by providing your access key and secret key.

To learn more about the IAM entities, see [IAM users](id_users.md "id_users.md") and [IAM roles](id_roles.md "id_roles.md").

AWS recommends that you use multi-factor authentication (MFA) with all users to increase
the security of your account. To learn more about MFA, see [AWS Multi-factor authentication in IAM](id_credentials_mfa.md "id_credentials_mfa.md").

## Authorization and permission policy

basics

Authorization refers to the principal having the required permissions to complete their
request. During authorization, IAM identifies the policies that apply to the request using
values from the request context. It then uses the policies to determine whether to allow or
deny the request. IAM stores most permission policies as [JSON documents](access_policies.md#access_policies-json "access_policies.md#access_policies-json") that specify the permissions for
principal entities.

There are [several types of policies](access_policies.md "access_policies.md") that can affect
an authorization request. To provide your users with permissions to access the AWS resources
in your account, you can use identity-based policies. Resource-based policies can grant [cross-account access](access_permissions-required.md#UserPermissionsAcrossAccounts "access_permissions-required.md#UserPermissionsAcrossAccounts"). To make a request in a
different account, a policy in the other account must allow you to access the resource
_and_ the IAM entity that you use to make the request
must have an identity-based policy that allows the request.

IAM checks each policy that applies to the context of your request. IAM policy
evaluation uses an _explicit deny_, which means that if a single
permissions policy includes a denied action, IAM denies the entire request and stops
evaluating. Because requests are _denied by default_, the applicable
permissions policies must allow every part of your request for IAM to authorize your
request. The evaluation logic for a request within a single account follows these basic
rules:

- By default, all requests are denied. (In general, requests made using the AWS account root user
  credentials for resources in the account are always allowed.)
- An explicit allow in any permissions policy (identity-based or resource-based)
  overrides this default.
- The existence of an AWS Organizations service control policy (SCP) or resource control policy
  (RCP), IAM permissions boundary, or a session policy overrides the allow. If one or more
  of these policy types exists, they must all allow the request. Otherwise, it's implicitly
  denied. For more information on SCPs and RCPs, see [Authorization policies in AWS Organizations](../../../organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_policies_authorization_policies.md "../../../organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_policies_authorization_policies.md") in the _AWS Organizations User Guide_.
- An explicit deny in any policy overrides any allows in any policy.

To learn more, see [Policy evaluation logic](reference_policies_evaluation-logic.md "reference_policies_evaluation-logic.md").

After IAM authenticates and authorizes the principal, IAM approves the actions or
operations in their request by evaluating the permission policy that applies to the principal.
Each AWS service defines the actions (operations) they support, and include things that you
can do to a resource, such as viewing, creating, editing, and deleting that resource. The
permission policy that applies to the principal must include the necessary actions to perform
an operation. To learn more about how IAM evaluates permission policies, see [Policy evaluation logic](reference_policies_evaluation-logic.md "reference_policies_evaluation-logic.md").

The service defines a set of actions that a principal can perform on each resource. When
creating permission policies, make sure to include the actions that you want the user to be
able to perform. For example, IAM supports over 40 actions for a user resource, including
the following basic actions:

- `CreateUser`
- `DeleteUser`
- `GetUser`
- `UpdateUser`

In addition, you can specify conditions in your permission policy that provide access to
resources when the request meets the specified conditions. For example, you might want a
policy statement to take effect after a specific date or to control access when a specific
value appears in an API. To specify conditions, you use the [Condition](reference_policies_elements_condition_operators.md "reference_policies_elements_condition_operators.md")
element of a policy statement.

After IAM approves the operations in a request, the principal can work with the related
resources in your account. A resource is an object that exists within a service. Examples
include an Amazon EC2 instance, an IAM user, and an Amazon S3 bucket. If the principal creates a
request to perform an action on a resource that isn't included in the permission policy, the
service denies the request. For example, if you have permission to delete an IAM role but
request to delete an IAM group, the request fails if you don't have permission to delete
IAM groups. To learn more about which actions, resources, and condition keys the different
AWS services support, see [Actions, Resources, and Condition Keys for AWS Services](reference_policies_actions-resources-contextkeys.md "reference_policies_actions-resources-contextkeys.md").
