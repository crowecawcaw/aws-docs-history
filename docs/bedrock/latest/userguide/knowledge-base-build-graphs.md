# Build a knowledge base with graphs from

Amazon Neptune Analytics

Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases offers a fully managed GraphRAG feature with Amazon Neptune. GraphRAG is a capability provided
with Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases that combines graph modeling with generative AI to enhance retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).
This feature combines vector search with the ability to quickly analyze large amounts of graph data from Amazon
Neptune in RAG applications.

GraphRAG automatically identifies and leverages relationships between entities and structural
elements within documents ingested into Knowledge Bases. This enables more comprehensive and contextually
relevant responses from the foundation models, particularly when the information needs to be
connected through multiple logical steps. This means that generative AI applications can deliver
more relevant responses in cases where connecting data and reasoning across multiple document
chunks is needed. This empowers applications like chatbots to deliver more relevant responses from
foundation models (FMs) in cases where related facts, entities, and relationships derived from multiple
document sources are required to answer questions

## GraphRAG Region availability

GraphRAG is available in the following AWS Regions:

- Europe (Frankfurt)
- Europe (London)
- Europe (Ireland)
- US West (Oregon)
- US East (N. Virginia)
- Asia Pacific (Tokyo)
- Asia Pacific (Singapore)

## Benefits of using GraphRAG

Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases with GraphRAG offers the following benefits:

- More relevant and comprehensive responses by automatically identifying and leveraging
  relationships between entities and structural elements (such as section titles) across multiple
  document sources that are ingested into Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases.
- Enhanced ability to perform exhaustive searches that connect different pieces of content
  through multiple logical steps, improving upon traditional RAG techniques.
- Better cross-document reasoning capabilities, allowing for more precise and contextually
  accurate answers by connecting information across various sources, which helps further enhance
  accuracy and minimize hallucinations.

## How GraphRAG works

After performing an initial vector search for the relevant nodes, Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases GraphRAG performs the following
steps to generate a better response:

1. Retrieves related graph nodes or chunk identifiers that are linked to the retrieved
   document chunks.
2. Expands on these related chunks by traversing the graph and retrieving their details from
   the graph database.
3. Provides more meaningful responses by understanding the relevant entities and focusing on
   the key connections using this enriched context.

## GraphRAG considerations and limitations

The following are some limitations when using Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases with GraphRAG

- Configuration options to customize the graph build are not supported.
- Autoscaling is not supported for Amazon Neptune Analytics graphs.
- GraphRAG only supports Amazon S3 as the data source.
- Claude 3 Haiku is chosen as the foundation model to automatically build graphs for your
  knowledge base. This automatically enables contextual enrichment.
- Each data source can have up to 1000 files. You can request to increase this limit to
  a maximum of 10000 files per data source. Alternatively, you can partition your Amazon S3 bucket
  into folders, where each folder can contain up to 1000 files.
- If you use hierarchical chunking as the chunking strategy, GraphRAG retrieves only the
  child chunks during the search operation. It doesn't replace the child chunks with their corresponding
  parent chunks. This means your search results contain the specific, detailed content from child chunks
  rather than the broader context from parent chunks.

###### Note

When deleting a knowledge base that uses Amazon Neptune Analytics, delete the knowledge base first, then delete the Amazon Neptune Analytics graph. Deleting a knowledge base doesn't automatically delete the underlying graph. Additional charges may be incurred until you explicitly delete the graph. Alternatively, set your data source deletion policy to RETAIN mode to delete the graph first without causing failures. For more information, see [Delete a data source from your Amazon Bedrock knowledge base](kb-ds-delete.md "kb-ds-delete.md").
