# Integrate Automated Reasoning checks in your application

After you deploy your Automated Reasoning policy in a guardrail (see [Deploy your Automated Reasoning policy in your application](deploy-automated-reasoning-policy.md "deploy-automated-reasoning-policy.md")), you can use it at runtime to
validate LLM responses and act on the feedback. This page explains how to call the
validation API, interpret the findings programmatically, and implement common integration
patterns such as rewriting invalid responses and asking clarifying questions.

Automated Reasoning checks operate in _detect mode_ only — they
return findings and feedback rather than blocking content. Your application is responsible
for deciding what to do with the findings: serve the response, rewrite it, ask for
clarification, or fall back to a default behavior.

## Integration overview

At runtime, the integration follows this flow:

```

```

Automated Reasoning findings are returned through any API that supports a Amazon Bedrock Guardrails
configuration:

- `ApplyGuardrail` — Standalone validation API. Use this when you want
  to validate content independently of the LLM invocation. This is the recommended
  approach for Automated Reasoning checks because it gives you full control over what
  content is validated and when.
- `Converse` and `InvokeModel` — LLM invocation APIs with
  guardrail configuration. Automated Reasoning findings are returned in the
  `trace` field of the response.
- `InvokeAgent` and `RetrieveAndGenerate` — Agent and
  knowledge base APIs with guardrail configuration.

This page focuses on the `ApplyGuardrail` API because it provides the
most flexibility for implementing the rewriting and clarification patterns described
below. For information about using guardrails with the other APIs, see [Use a guardrail](guardrails-use.md "guardrails-use.md").

## Open-source rewriting chatbot

sample

For a complete, production-style implementation of the patterns described on this
page, see the [Automated Reasoning checks rewriting chatbot](https://github.com/aws-samples/amazon-bedrock-samples/tree/main/responsible_ai/automated-reasoning-rewriting-chatbot "https://github.com/aws-samples/amazon-bedrock-samples/tree/main/responsible_ai/automated-reasoning-rewriting-chatbot") on GitHub. This sample
application demonstrates:

- An iterative rewriting loop where invalid responses are automatically corrected
  based on AR feedback.
- Follow-up questions when the LLM needs additional context from the user to
  rewrite accurately.
- A timeout mechanism that automatically resumes processing when users don't
  respond to clarification questions.
- Policy context injection into LLM prompts so the LLM can reference the full
  policy rules during rewriting.
- JSON audit logging of every validation iteration for compliance and
  debugging.

The sample uses a Python/Flask backend with a React frontend and communicates with
Amazon Bedrock for LLM inference and Amazon Bedrock Guardrails for validation through the
`ApplyGuardrail` API.

###### Note

The sample application includes the policy content directly in the LLM generation
prompts to support any Automated Reasoning policy without requiring document uploads.
In a production deployment, you would typically use RAG content or feed the LLM the
original natural language document instead of the Automated Reasoning policy source
code.

## Call ApplyGuardrail with Automated Reasoning

checks

Use the `ApplyGuardrail` API to validate content against your guardrail.
The API accepts one or more content blocks and returns an assessment that includes
Automated Reasoning findings.

### Request structure

`guardrailIdentifier` (required)

The guardrail ID or ARN. Use the guardrail that has your Automated
Reasoning policy attached.

`guardrailVersion` (required)

The guardrail version number (for example, `1`). Use a numbered
version for production workloads, not `DRAFT`.

`source` (required)

Set to `OUTPUT` when validating LLM responses. Set to
`INPUT` when validating user prompts. For Automated Reasoning
checks, you typically validate the LLM output.

`content` (required)

An array of content blocks to validate. Each block contains a
`text` field with the content to check. You can pass the user
question and the LLM response as separate content blocks, or combine them
into a single block.

### Example: Validate an LLM

response using the AWS CLI

```
aws bedrock-runtime apply-guardrail \
  --guardrail-identifier "`your-guardrail-id`" \
  --guardrail-version "`1`" \
  --source OUTPUT \
  --content '[
    {
      "text": {
        "text": "User: Am I eligible for parental leave if I have been working here for 2 years full-time?\nAssistant: Yes, you are eligible for parental leave."
      }
    }
  ]'
```

### Example: Validate an LLM

response using Python (boto3)

```
import boto3
import json

bedrock_runtime = boto3.client("bedrock-runtime", region_name="`us-east-1`")

response = bedrock_runtime.apply_guardrail(
    guardrailIdentifier="`your-guardrail-id`",
    guardrailVersion="`1`",
    source="OUTPUT",
    content=[
        {
            "text": {
                "text": (
                    "User: Am I eligible for parental leave if I have been "
                    "working here for 2 years full-time?\n"
                    "Assistant: Yes, you are eligible for parental leave."
                )
            }
        }
    ],
)

# The AR findings are in the assessments
for assessment in response.get("assessments", []):
    ar_assessment = assessment.get("automatedReasoningPolicy", {})
    findings = ar_assessment.get("findings", [])
    for finding in findings:
        # Each finding is a union — exactly one key is present
        # Possible keys: valid, invalid, satisfiable, impossible,
        #                translationAmbiguous, tooComplex, noTranslations
        print(json.dumps(finding, indent=2, default=str))
```

### Response structure

The `ApplyGuardrail` response includes an `assessments`
array. Each assessment contains an `automatedReasoningPolicy` object with
a `findings` array. Each finding is a union type — exactly one of the
following keys is present:

- `valid`
- `invalid`
- `satisfiable`
- `impossible`
- `translationAmbiguous`
- `tooComplex`
- `noTranslations`

For a detailed description of each finding type and its fields, see [Findings and validation results](automated-reasoning-checks-concepts.md#ar-concept-findings "automated-reasoning-checks-concepts.md#ar-concept-findings").

## Interpret AR findings at runtime

To act on Automated Reasoning findings programmatically, your application needs to
extract the finding type, the translation details, and the supporting or contradicting
rules. The following sections explain how to parse each part of a finding.

### Determine the finding type

Each finding is a union — exactly one key is present. Check which key exists to
determine the finding type:

```
def get_finding_type(finding):
    """Return the finding type and its data from an AR finding union."""
    for finding_type in [
        "valid", "invalid", "satisfiable", "impossible",
        "translationAmbiguous", "tooComplex", "noTranslations"
    ]:
        if finding_type in finding:
            return finding_type, finding[finding_type]
    return None, None
```

### Read the translation

Most finding types include a `translation` object that shows how
Automated Reasoning checks translated the natural language input into formal logic.
The translation contains:

- `premises` — The conditions extracted from the input (for example,
  `isFullTime = true`, `tenureMonths = 24`).
- `claims` — The assertions to validate (for example,
  `eligibleForParentalLeave = true`).
- `untranslatedPremises` — Parts of the input that could not be
  mapped to policy variables. These parts are not validated.
- `untranslatedClaims` — Claims that could not be mapped to policy
  variables.

Check `untranslatedPremises` and `untranslatedClaims` to
understand the scope of the validation. A `VALID` result only covers the
translated claims — untranslated content is not verified.

### Read the supporting or contradicting rules

Depending on the finding type, the finding includes rules that explain the
result:

- `valid` findings include `supportingRules` — the policy
  rules that prove the claims are correct.
- `invalid` findings include `contradictingRules` — the
  policy rules that the claims violate.
- `satisfiable` findings include both a
  `claimsTrueScenario` and a `claimsFalseScenario` — showing
  the conditions under which the claims are true and false.

These rules and scenarios are the key inputs for the rewriting pattern described
in [Rewrite invalid responses using AR
feedback](#rewrite-invalid-responses "#rewrite-invalid-responses").

### Determine the aggregate result

A single validation request can return multiple findings. To determine the overall
result, sort findings by severity and select the worst. The severity order from worst
to best is: `TRANSLATION_AMBIGUOUS`, `IMPOSSIBLE`,
`INVALID`, `SATISFIABLE`, `VALID`.

```
SEVERITY_ORDER = {
    "tooComplex": 0,
    "translationAmbiguous": 0,
    "impossible": 1,
    "invalid": 2,
    "satisfiable": 3,
    "valid": 4,
    "noTranslations": 5,
}

def get_aggregate_result(findings):
    """Return the worst finding type from a list of findings."""
    worst = None
    worst_severity = float("inf")
    for finding in findings:
        finding_type, _ = get_finding_type(finding)
        severity = SEVERITY_ORDER.get(finding_type, 0)
        if severity < worst_severity:
            worst_severity = severity
            worst = finding_type
    return worst
```

## Handle validation outcomes in your

application

Use the aggregate result to decide what your application does next. The following
table summarizes the recommended action for each result type.

| Result                 | What it means                                                                                                                                | Recommended action                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

| `satisfiable`          | The response is correct under some conditions but not all.

| `impossible`           | The premises are contradictory, or the policy contains conflicting<br>rules.                                                                 | Ask the user to clarify their input (see [Ask clarifying questions](#ask-clarifying-questions "#ask-clarifying-questions")). If the issue persists, it may<br>indicate a policy problem — review the quality report.                                         |

| `tooComplex`           | The input exceeds processing limits for logical analysis.                                                                                    | Simplify the input by breaking it into smaller parts, or return a fallback<br>message explaining that the response could not be verified.                                                                                                                    |

Serve the response without AR<br>validation, or use other guardrail components (such as topic policies) to<br>handle off-topic content.                                                                            |

## Rewrite invalid responses using AR

feedback

The most powerful integration pattern for Automated Reasoning checks is the
_rewriting loop_: when a response is `invalid` or
`satisfiable`, your application constructs a prompt that includes the
original response, the specific findings, and the policy rules, then asks the LLM to
rewrite the response to be consistent with the policy. The rewritten response is
validated again, and the loop continues until the response is `valid` or a
maximum number of iterations is reached.

### Rewriting loop flow

         Return best response
         with warning

```

### Construct the rewriting prompt

The rewriting prompt should include three pieces of information from the AR
findings:

1. The original response that failed validation.
2. The specific finding — including the translated premises, claims, and the
   contradicting or supporting rules.
3. An instruction to rewrite the response so that it is consistent with the
   policy rules.

**Example rewriting prompt template:**

```
The following response was checked against our policy and found to be
{finding_type}.

Original response:
{original_response}

The validation found the following issue:
- Premises (what was understood from the input): {premises}
- Claims (what was asserted): {claims}
- Contradicting rules: {contradicting_rules}

Please rewrite the response so that it is consistent with the policy document.
Keep the same helpful tone and answer the user's question
accurately based on the rules. If you cannot provide an accurate answer
without more information, explain what additional information is needed.
```

###### Tip

Always include the Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) content in your
rewriting requests or the policy rules so the LLM has all the context it needs
when rewriting. The rewriting prompt template provides
the specific finding details, while the system prompt provides the broader policy
context. This dual-context approach is demonstrated in the [open-source rewriting chatbot sample](https://github.com/aws-samples/amazon-bedrock-samples/tree/main/responsible_ai/automated-reasoning-rewriting-chatbot "https://github.com/aws-samples/amazon-bedrock-samples/tree/main/responsible_ai/automated-reasoning-rewriting-chatbot").

### Rewriting best practices

- **Set a maximum iteration count.** The rewriting
  loop should have a hard limit (typically 2–5 iterations) to prevent infinite
  loops. If the response is still not `valid` after the maximum
  iterations, return the best response with a warning or fall back to a default
  message.
- **Process findings in priority order.** When
  multiple findings are returned, address the most severe finding first. The
  severity order is: `translationAmbiguous`,
  `impossible`, `invalid`, `satisfiable`,
  `valid`.
- **Include policy context in the system prompt.**
  The LLM needs access either to the source document or the full policy rules to rewrite accurately.
  You can use a [Knowledge Base](knowledge-base.md "knowledge-base.md") to include your documents in the generation request or use
  the `ExportAutomatedReasoningPolicyVersion` API to retrieve the policy
  definition and format it for the LLM.
- **Log each iteration.** Record the original
  response, the findings, the rewriting prompt, and the rewritten response for
  each iteration. This audit trail is valuable for debugging and compliance (see
  [Build an audit trail](#build-audit-trail "#build-audit-trail")).

## Ask clarifying questions

When Automated Reasoning checks return `translationAmbiguous`,
`satisfiable`, or `impossible` results, the LLM may not have
enough information to rewrite the response accurately. In these cases, your application
can ask the user for clarification, then incorporate the answers into the next
validation attempt.

### When to ask for clarification

- **`translationAmbiguous`** — The
  input has multiple valid interpretations. The `options` field shows
  the competing interpretations, and the `differenceScenarios` field
  shows how they differ in practice. Use these to generate targeted questions
  about the specific ambiguity.
- **`satisfiable`** — The response is
  correct under some conditions but not all. The
  `claimsFalseScenario` shows the conditions under which the response
  would be incorrect. Ask the user about those specific conditions.
- **`impossible`** — The input contains
  contradictory statements. Ask the user to clarify the contradiction.
- **Rewriting fails** — If the LLM cannot rewrite
  the response to be `valid` after multiple attempts, it may need
  additional context from the user. Ask the LLM to generate clarifying questions
  based on the findings.

### Clarification pattern

The clarification flow works as follows:

1. Extract the ambiguous variables or missing conditions from the AR
   findings.
2. Generate clarifying questions — either programmatically from the finding
   fields, or by asking the LLM to formulate questions based on the findings.
3. Present the questions to the user and collect answers.
4. Incorporate the answers into the context and generate a new response.
5. Validate the new response with `ApplyGuardrail`.

**Example: Generate clarifying questions from a
`satisfiable` finding**

```
def generate_clarifying_questions(finding_data, user_question):
    """Ask the LLM to generate clarifying questions from a SATISFIABLE finding."""
    claims_true = json.dumps(
        finding_data.get("claimsTrueScenario", {}), indent=2, default=str
    )
    claims_false = json.dumps(
        finding_data.get("claimsFalseScenario", {}), indent=2, default=str
    )

    prompt = (
        f"A user asked: {user_question}\n\n"
        f"The answer is correct when these conditions hold:\n{claims_true}\n\n"

## Build an audit trail

Automated Reasoning findings provide mathematically verifiable proof of validity.
For regulated industries and compliance scenarios, this proof is a key differentiator —
you can demonstrate that an AI response was verified against specific policy rules with
specific variable assignments, not just pattern-matched or probabilistically
assessed.

To build an effective audit trail, log the following information for each validation
request:

- **Timestamp and request ID.** When the validation
  occurred and a unique identifier for the request.
- **Input content.** The user question and LLM
  response that were validated.
- **Finding type and details.** The validation result
  (`valid`, `invalid`, etc.), the translated premises and
  claims, and the supporting or contradicting rules.
- **Action taken.** What your application did with
  the finding — served the response, rewrote it, asked for clarification, or blocked
  it.
- **Rewriting history.** If the response was
  rewritten, log each iteration: the original response, the rewriting prompt, the
  rewritten response, and the validation result for each iteration.
- **Policy version.** The guardrail version and
  policy version used for validation. This ensures you can reproduce the validation
  result later.

###### Tip

Store audit logs in a durable, tamper-evident store such as Amazon CloudWatch Logs or Amazon S3
with object lock enabled. For compliance scenarios, consider using Lake
to query audit logs across your organization.
