# Creating a RAG evaluation job

in Amazon Bedrock

You can create a RAG evaluation job using the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, or a supported AWS SDK.

This type of job requires access to an evaluator model. If you are creating a retrieve-and-generate job that uses an Amazon Bedrock model as the response generator, you need access to that model as well.
Both models must be available in the same AWS Region.
For a list of supported response generator and evaluator models, see [Supported models](evaluation-kb.md#evaluation-kb-supported "evaluation-kb.md#evaluation-kb-supported").

## Prerequisites

In addition to having access to at least one evaluator model, to create a RAG evaluation job, you also need certain IAM service role permissions.
To learn more about the necessary actions and trust policy requirements, see [Required service role permissions for creating a model evaluation job that uses a judge model](judge-service-roles.md "judge-service-roles.md").

When you create the job, you specify a prompt dataset in an Amazon S3 bucket, and an output bucket to store your results in. To ensure your S3 buckets have the
necessary CORS permissions, see [Required Cross Origin Resource Sharing
(CORS) permissions on S3 buckets](model-evaluation-security-cors.md "model-evaluation-security-cors.md")

To create a job in the console, the console needs permission to perform a certain set of actions and have access to the needed resources. The following policy defines
a minimum set of IAM permissions required to create a job in the console. In the policy, we recommend using the IAM JSON policy element
[Resource](../../../IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_elements_resource.md "../../../IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_elements_resource.md") to limit access to only the models and buckets required for the
IAM user, group, or role.

The IAM policy must grant access to both an evaluator model and, for retrieve and generate jobs that use an Amazon Bedrock response generator model, to the response generator.

###### Note

This example policy gives permissions for all Amazon Bedrock foundation models. In a production environment, we recommend that you follow the principal of
[least privilege](../../../IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.md#grant-least-privilege "../../../IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.md#grant-least-privilege") and only grant permissions for the models you need.
