## Model Details
<a name="model-card-twelvelabs-pegasus-v1-5-details"></a>

Pegasus v1.5 is TwelveLabs' video-to-text generation model that produces summaries, detailed descriptions, and structured responses about video content. Building on Pegasus v1.2, it adds video segmentation to transform raw video into structured, timestamped metadata across an entire video. For more information about model development and performance, see the [model/service card](https://docs.twelvelabs.io/docs/concepts/models/pegasus).

**Tip**  
Whenever possible, we recommend using the `bedrock-runtime` endpoint for new applications. See [Inference endpoints supported by Amazon Bedrock](endpoints.md) for details.

**Note**  
Pegasus v1.5 is available through cross-Region inference only. Requests must use the US geographic inference profile (`us.twelvelabs.pegasus-1-5-v1:0`) or the global inference profile (`global.twelvelabs.pegasus-1-5-v1:0`). In-Region on-demand inference is not supported.

## Pricing
<a name="model-card-twelvelabs-pegasus-v1-5-pricing"></a>

This model is a third-party model offered and billed through AWS Marketplace. Charges appear on your AWS bill and in AWS Cost Explorer under the model provider (not under Amazon Bedrock). For pricing, see the [Amazon Bedrock Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/pricing/) page.

## Programmatic Access
<a name="model-card-twelvelabs-pegasus-v1-5-programmatic-access"></a>

Use the following model IDs and endpoint URLs to access this model programmatically. Pegasus v1.5 is available through cross-Region inference only, so you must use the geo or global inference ID rather than the base model ID. For more information about the available APIs and endpoints, see [APIs supported](apis.html) and [Endpoints supported](endpoints.html).

For the full request parameters, response fields, and request and response examples, see [TwelveLabs Pegasus 1.5](model-parameters-pegasus-1-5.md).


| **Endpoint** | **Model ID** | **In-Region endpoint URL** | **Geo inference ID** | **Global inference ID** | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | 
| bedrock-runtime | twelvelabs.pegasus-1-5-v1:0 | N/A | us.twelvelabs.pegasus-1-5-v1:0 | global.twelvelabs.pegasus-1-5-v1:0 | 

*For example, to use Global cross-Region inference from us-east-1 (N. Virginia), use the endpoint URL "https://bedrock-runtime.us-east-1.amazonaws.com" with the inference profile ID "global.twelvelabs.pegasus-1-5-v1:0".*

## Service Tiers
<a name="model-card-twelvelabs-pegasus-v1-5-tiers"></a>

Amazon Bedrock offers multiple service tiers to match your workload requirements. **Standard** provides pay-per-token access with no commitment (set `"service_tier": "default"` or omit the field). **Priority** delivers the fastest response times for a price premium (set `"service_tier": "priority"`). **Flex** provides lower-cost access for flexible, non-time-sensitive workloads (set `"service_tier": "flex"`). **Reserved** provides dedicated throughput with a term commitment for predictable workloads; it is set at the account level rather than per request (contact your AWS account team to enable). For more information, see [service tiers](service-tiers-inference.html).


| **Standard** | **Priority** | **Flex** | **Reserved** | **Batch** |

## Regional Availability
<a name="model-card-twelvelabs-pegasus-v1-5-regional-availability"></a>

***Regional availability at a glance***

Amazon Bedrock offers three inference options: **In-Region** keeps requests within a single Region for strict compliance, **Geo Cross-Region** routes across Regions within a geography (such as US, EU, and APAC) while respecting data residency, and **Global Cross-Region** routes anywhere worldwide when there are no residency constraints. Refer to the [Regional availability by models](models-region-compatibility.md) page for more details.

Pegasus v1.5 supports Geo Cross-Region inference from the US Regions and Global Cross-Region inference from the Regions listed in the following table. In-Region inference is not supported.

The Region you call is the source Region. The inference profile you use determines where the request can be served:
+ The US geographic inference profile (`us.twelvelabs.pegasus-1-5-v1:0`) routes requests to us-east-1, us-east-2, and us-west-2.
+ The global inference profile (`global.twelvelabs.pegasus-1-5-v1:0`) routes requests globally across all supported AWS Regions.

## Quotas and Limits
<a name="model-card-twelvelabs-pegasus-v1-5-quotas"></a>

Your AWS account has default quotas to maintain the performance of the service and to ensure appropriate usage of Amazon Bedrock. The default quotas assigned to an account might be updated depending on regional factors, payment history, fraudulent usage, and/or approval of a quota [increase request](quotas-increase.html). For more information, see [Quotas for Amazon Bedrock](quotas.md) documentation and see the [limits](/general/latest/gr/bedrock.html#limits_bedrock) for the model.

## Sample Code
<a name="model-card-twelvelabs-pegasus-v1-5-sample-code"></a>

**Step 1 - AWS Account:** If you have an AWS account already, skip this step. If you are new to AWS, sign up for an [AWS account](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup).

**Step 2 - API key:** Go to the [Amazon Bedrock console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/home#/api-keys/long-term/create) and generate a long-term API key.

**Step 3 - Get the SDK:** To use this getting started guide, you must have Python already installed. Then install the relevant software depending on the APIs you are using.

```
pip install boto3
```

**Step 4 - Set environment variables:** Configure your environment to use the API key for authentication.

```
AWS_BEARER_TOKEN_BEDROCK="<provide your Bedrock API key>"
```

**Step 5 - Run your first inference request:** Save the file as `bedrock-first-request.py`

------
#### [ Invoke API ]

```
import json
import boto3

client = boto3.client('bedrock-runtime', region_name='us-east-1')
response = client.invoke_model(
    modelId='us.twelvelabs.pegasus-1-5-v1:0',
    body=json.dumps({
            'inputPrompt': 'Tell me about this video',
            'mediaSource': {
                's3Location': {
                    'uri': 's3://your-bucket/your-video.mp4',
                    'bucketOwner': '123456789012'
                }
            },
            'maxOutputTokens': 4096
    })
)
print(json.loads(response['body'].read()))
```

**Note**  
Replace `s3Location.uri` with a bucket in the same AWS Region that you send the request to — `us-east-1` in this example. The bucket Region must match the request Region even though the model is accessed through a geo or global inference profile, and a bucket in any other Region fails with a `ValidationException`. For the full parameter reference, see [TwelveLabs Pegasus 1.5](model-parameters-pegasus-1-5.md).
