## Model Details
<a name="model-card-amazon-nova-2-5-sonic-details"></a>

Nova 2.5 Sonic is Amazon's latest speech-to-speech foundation model for building natural, real-time voice conversation applications. It delivers improved reasoning, instruction following, and tool calling accuracy over Nova 2 Sonic, along with lower latency and more concise responses. These improvements make it well suited for agentic voice applications. For more information about model development and performance, see the [model/service card](/ai/responsible-ai/nova-2-5-sonic/overview.html).

## Programmatic Access
<a name="model-card-amazon-nova-2-5-sonic-programmatic-access"></a>

Use the following model IDs and endpoint URLs to access this model programmatically. For more information about the available APIs and endpoints, see [APIs supported](apis.html) and [Endpoints supported](endpoints.html).


| **Endpoint** | **Model ID** | **In-Region endpoint URL** | **Geo inference ID** | **Global inference ID** | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | 
| bedrock-runtime | amazon.nova-2-5-sonic | https://bedrock-runtime.{region}.amazonaws.com | Not supported | Not supported | 

*For example, if region is us-east-1 (N. Virginia), then the bedrock-runtime endpoint URL will be "https://bedrock-runtime.us-east-1.amazonaws.com" and for bedrock-mantle will be "https://bedrock-mantle.us-east-1.api.aws/v1".*

## Service Tiers
<a name="model-card-amazon-nova-2-5-sonic-tiers"></a>

Amazon Bedrock offers multiple service tiers to match your workload requirements. **Standard** provides pay-per-token access with no commitment (set `"service_tier": "default"` or omit the field). **Priority** delivers the fastest response times for a price premium (set `"service_tier": "priority"`). **Flex** provides lower-cost access for flexible, non-time-sensitive workloads (set `"service_tier": "flex"`). **Reserved** provides dedicated throughput with a term commitment for predictable workloads; it is set at the account level rather than per request (contact your AWS account team to enable). For more information, see [service tiers](service-tiers-inference.html).


| **Standard** | **Priority** | **Flex** | **Reserved** | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

## Regional Availability
<a name="model-card-amazon-nova-2-5-sonic-regional-availability"></a>

***Regional availability at a glance***

Amazon Bedrock offers three inference options: **In-Region** keeps requests within a single Region for strict compliance, **Geo Cross-Region** routes across Regions within a geography (such as US, EU, and APAC) while respecting data residency, and **Global Cross-Region** routes anywhere worldwide when there are no residency constraints. Refer to the [Regional availability by models](models-region-compatibility.md) page for more details.

## Quotas and Limits
<a name="model-card-amazon-nova-2-5-sonic-quotas"></a>

The default quota for Nova 2.5 Sonic is 20 concurrent `InvokeModelWithBidirectionalStream` sessions per AWS account in each supported Region. Contact your AWS account team to request a higher limit.

Your AWS account has default quotas to maintain the performance of the service and to ensure appropriate usage of Amazon Bedrock. The default quotas assigned to an account might be updated depending on regional factors, payment history, fraudulent usage, and/or approval of a quota [increase request](quotas-increase.html). For more information, see [Quotas for Amazon Bedrock](quotas.md) documentation and see the [limits](/general/latest/gr/bedrock.html#limits_bedrock) for the model.

## Sample Code
<a name="model-card-amazon-nova-2-5-sonic-sample-code"></a>

**Step 1 - AWS Account:** If you have an AWS account already, skip this step. If you are new to AWS, sign up for an [AWS account](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup).

**Step 2 - API key:** Go to the [Amazon Bedrock console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/home#/api-keys/long-term/create) and generate a long-term API key.

**Step 3 - Get the SDK:**

```
pip install boto3
```

**Step 4 - Set environment variables:**

```
AWS_BEARER_TOKEN_BEDROCK="<provide your Bedrock API key>"
```

**Step 5 - Run your first inference request:** This model uses `InvokeModelWithBidirectionalStream`. See [API reference](/bedrock/latest/APIReference/API_runtime_InvokeModelWithBidirectionalStream.html) for details.
