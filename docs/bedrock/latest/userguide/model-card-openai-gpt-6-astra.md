### JSON Schema output on bedrock-runtime
<a name="model-card-openai-gpt-6-astra-structured-output"></a>

Use JSON Schema to set the format of the model response. These settings apply to non-streaming calls on the `bedrock-runtime` endpoint. Choose a profile ID from [Programmatic access](#model-card-openai-gpt-6-astra-programmatic-access).
+ For Chat Completions, set `response_format.type` to `json_schema`. Put `name`, `schema`, and `strict: true` in `response_format.json_schema`.
+ For Responses, set `text.format.type` to `json_schema`. Put `name`, `schema`, and `strict: true` in `text.format`.
+ For Converse, set `outputConfig.textFormat.type` to `json_schema`. In `outputConfig.textFormat.structure.jsonSchema`, set `name` and `schema`. Encode the schema as a JSON string. Then set `additionalModelRequestFields.text.format.strict` to `true`.

Use an object schema. Put all fields in `required`. Set `additionalProperties` to `false`. Validate your schema before you send it. Check for refusals or incomplete responses before you parse the output.

**Important**  
For JSON Schema output with the Converse API, you must set `additionalModelRequestFields.text.format.strict` to `true`, in addition to specifying the schema in `outputConfig`. Include the following field in your request.  

```
{
  "additionalModelRequestFields": {
    "text": {
      "format": { "strict": true }
    }
  }
}
```

## Pricing
<a name="model-card-openai-gpt-6-astra-pricing"></a>

All prices are in USD per 1 million tokens. The following tables list Standard and Ultrafast prices.

Commercial In-Region and Geo CRIS prices include a 10% premium over the corresponding OpenAI rates for the same service tier. You do not need to add this premium.

*Priority and Flex tiers are not supported for this model.*

### Standard — Commercial Regions, short context (272K input tokens or fewer)
<a name="model-card-openai-gpt-6-astra-pricing-commercial-short"></a>


| **Inference option** | **Input** | **Input — 30m cache write** | **Input — cache read** | **Output** | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | 
| In-Region | $11.00 | $13.75 | $1.10 | $55.00 | 
| Geo CRIS | $11.00 | $13.75 | $1.10 | $55.00 | 
| Global CRIS | $10.00 | $12.50 | $1.00 | $50.00 | 

### Standard — Commercial Regions, long context (more than 272K input tokens)
<a name="model-card-openai-gpt-6-astra-pricing-commercial-long"></a>


| **Inference option** | **Input** | **Input — 30m cache write** | **Input — cache read** | **Output** | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | 
| In-Region | $22.00 | $27.50 | $2.20 | $82.50 | 
| Geo CRIS | $22.00 | $27.50 | $2.20 | $82.50 | 
| Global CRIS | $20.00 | $25.00 | $2.00 | $75.00 | 

Ultrafast prices are six times the corresponding Standard prices. On `bedrock-runtime`, Ultrafast is available through both US geographic CRIS and Global CRIS. On `bedrock-mantle`, Ultrafast is available in `us-east-1`. Short-context prices apply to requests with at most 272,000 input tokens. When input exceeds this threshold, long-context prices apply to the entire request.

### Ultrafast — Commercial Regions, short context (272K input tokens or fewer)
<a name="model-card-openai-gpt-6-astra-pricing-ultrafast-short"></a>


| **Inference option** | **Input** | **Input — 30m cache write** | **Input — cache read** | **Output** | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | 
| In-Region (us-east-1) | $66.00 | $82.50 | $6.60 | $330.00 | 
| Geo CRIS (US) | $66.00 | $82.50 | $6.60 | $330.00 | 
| Global CRIS | $60.00 | $75.00 | $6.00 | $300.00 | 

### Ultrafast — Commercial Regions, long context (more than 272K input tokens)
<a name="model-card-openai-gpt-6-astra-pricing-ultrafast-long"></a>


| **Inference option** | **Input** | **Input — 30m cache write** | **Input — cache read** | **Output** | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | 
| In-Region (us-east-1) | $132.00 | $165.00 | $13.20 | $495.00 |

| Global CRIS | $120.00 | $150.00 | $12.00 | $450.00 | 

## Programmatic Access
<a name="model-card-openai-gpt-6-astra-programmatic-access"></a>

To call this model from code, use the following model IDs and endpoint URLs. For more information, see [APIs supported by Amazon Bedrock](apis.md) and [Endpoints supported by Amazon Bedrock](endpoints.md).


| **Endpoint** | **Model ID** | **In-Region endpoint URL** | **Geo inference ID** | **Global inference ID** | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | 
| bedrock-mantle | openai.gpt-6-astra | `https://bedrock-mantle.us-east-1.api.aws/openai/v1`<br />`https://bedrock-mantle.us-west-2.api.aws/openai/v1` (Standard only) | Not supported | Not supported | 
| bedrock-runtime | openai.gpt-6-astra | Not supported | us.openai.gpt-6-astra | global.openai.gpt-6-astra | 

*The `bedrock-mantle` endpoint is available in `us-east-1` (N. Virginia) and `us-west-2` (Oregon). Ultrafast is available only in `us-east-1` on this endpoint. On `bedrock-runtime`, the base URL is `https://bedrock-runtime.{region}.amazonaws.com/openai/v1`. Name `us.openai.gpt-6-astra` for US geographic cross-Region inference or `global.openai.gpt-6-astra` for global cross-Region inference.*

## Service Tiers
<a name="model-card-openai-gpt-6-astra-tiers"></a>

Amazon Bedrock offers several service tiers for different workloads. **Standard** gives you pay-per-token access with no commitment. To use it, set `"service_tier": "default"` or omit the field. For more information, see [service tiers](service-tiers-inference.html).

**Ultrafast** is a speed tier for GPT-6 Astra. OpenAI reports API speeds up to six times faster than Standard. To request it with the Responses API, set `"service_tier": "ultrafast"`.


| **Standard** | **Ultrafast** | **Priority** | **Flex** | **Reserved** | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | 
| ![supported](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/images/icons/icon-yes.png) | ![supported](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/images/icons/icon-yes.png) | ![not-supported](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/images/icons/icon-no.png) | ![not-supported](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/images/icons/icon-no.png) | ![not-supported](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/images/icons/icon-no.png) | 

Use one of these routes for Ultrafast:
+ `bedrock-mantle` in `us-east-1`, with model ID `openai.gpt-6-astra`.
+ `bedrock-runtime`, with `us.openai.gpt-6-astra` for US geographic CRIS or `global.openai.gpt-6-astra` for Global CRIS.

**Note**  
Ultrafast does not support regional Mantle access in `us-west-2`. If an existing session is pinned to Oregon capacity, start a new session using an Ultrafast-supported route.

## Regional Availability
<a name="model-card-openai-gpt-6-astra-regional-availability"></a>

***Regional availability at a glance***

Amazon Bedrock offers three inference options. **In-Region** keeps requests in one Region for strict compliance. **Geo Cross-Region** routes requests across Regions in one geography. It respects data residency. **Global Cross-Region** routes requests anywhere in the world. Use it when you have no data residency needs. For more information, see the [Regional availability by models](models-region-compatibility.md) page.

**Availability using the `bedrock-mantle` endpoint**

## Quotas and Limits
<a name="model-card-openai-gpt-6-astra-quotas"></a>

Your AWS account has default quotas. These quotas help keep Amazon Bedrock running well. A few things can change your quotas. These include Region, payment history, fraudulent use, or an approved quota [increase request](quotas-increase.html). For more information, see the [Quotas for Amazon Bedrock](quotas.md) documentation and the [limits](/general/latest/gr/bedrock.html#limits_bedrock) for the model.

On the `bedrock-runtime` endpoint, limits are managed as tokens per minute (TPM) with a 10x burndown rate, where 1 output token consumes 10 tokens.

## Sample Code
<a name="model-card-openai-gpt-6-astra-sample-code"></a>

**Step 1 - AWS Account:** If you already have an AWS account, skip this step. If you are new to AWS, sign up for an [AWS account](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup).

**Step 2 - API key:** Go to the [Amazon Bedrock console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/home#/api-keys/long-term/create) and generate a long-term API key.

**Step 3 - Get the SDK:** You must have Python installed to use this guide. Then install the OpenAI SDK.

```
pip install openai
```

### Step 4 - Set environment variables
<a name="model-card-openai-gpt-6-astra-sample-code-environment"></a>

Set up your environment to use the API key for authentication.

------
#### [ bedrock-mantle ]

```
OPENAI_API_KEY="<provide your Bedrock API key>"
OPENAI_BASE_URL="https://bedrock-mantle.us-west-2.api.aws/openai/v1"
```

------
#### [ bedrock-runtime ]

```
OPENAI_API_KEY="<provide your Bedrock API key>"
OPENAI_BASE_URL="https://bedrock-runtime.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/openai/v1"
```

------

**Note**  
On `bedrock-runtime`, name a cross-Region inference profile as the model: `us.openai.gpt-6-astra` or `global.openai.gpt-6-astra`. This model is not available for in-Region inference on that endpoint.

### Step 5 - Run your first inference request
<a name="model-card-openai-gpt-6-astra-sample-code-request"></a>

Save the file as `bedrock-first-request.py`.

#### bedrock-mantle
<a name="model-card-openai-gpt-6-astra-sample-code-mantle"></a>

Use the settings from [Step 4 - Set environment variables](#model-card-openai-gpt-6-astra-sample-code-environment). Choose the `bedrock-mantle` tab. The Chat tab uses the Chat Completions API.

------
#### [ Responses API ]

```
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI()

response = client.responses.create(
    model="openai.gpt-6-astra",
    input="Can you explain the features of Amazon Bedrock?"
)
print(response)
```

------
#### [ Chat ]

```
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI()

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="openai.gpt-6-astra",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Can you explain the features of Amazon Bedrock?"}]
)
print(response)
```

------

#### [ Responses API ]

```
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI()

response = client.responses.create(
    model="us.openai.gpt-6-astra",
    input="Can you explain the features of Amazon Bedrock?"
)
print(response)
```

## Ultrafast example
<a name="model-card-openai-gpt-6-astra-ultrafast-example"></a>

Set `OPENAI_API_KEY` to your Amazon Bedrock API key. This example uses the `bedrock-mantle` endpoint in `us-east-1`.

```
export OPENAI_API_KEY="<your Amazon Bedrock API key>"
```

```
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(
    base_url="https://bedrock-mantle.us-east-1.api.aws/openai/v1",
)
response = client.responses.create(
    model="openai.gpt-6-astra",
    service_tier="ultrafast",
    input="Explain how Amazon Bedrock cross-Region inference works.",
)
print(response.output_text)
```

For `bedrock-runtime`, use the OpenAI-compatible base URL from [Programmatic Access](#model-card-openai-gpt-6-astra-programmatic-access). Set the model to `us.openai.gpt-6-astra` for US geographic CRIS or `global.openai.gpt-6-astra` for Global CRIS, and keep `service_tier="ultrafast"`.
