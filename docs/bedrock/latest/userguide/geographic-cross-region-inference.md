# Geographic cross-Region inference

Geographic cross-Region inference keeps data processing within specified geographic
boundaries (such as US, EU, and APAC). This option is ideal for organizations with data
residency requirements and compliance regulations.

## Geographic cross-Region inference considerations

Note the following information about Geographic cross-Region inference:

- Cross-Region inference requests to an inference profile tied to a
  geography (such as US, EU, and APAC) stay within that geography. Your data
  remains in the AWS Regions where it originally resides. For example, a
  request made within the US is kept within the AWS Regions in the US.
  By default, the data remains stored only in the source Region. However, your input
  prompts and output results might move outside of your source Region during
  cross-Region inference. To the extent we store data for abuse detection,
  your input prompts and output results will be stored in the destination region.
  See [Amazon Bedrock abuse detection](abuse-detection.md "abuse-detection.md")
  for more information on which models require storage. All data will be transmitted
  encrypted across Amazon's secure network.
- For default cross-Region throughput quotas when using inference
  profiles tied to a geography (such as US, EU, and APAC), see the
  **Cross-region model inference requests per minute
  for ${Model}** and **Cross-region model
 inference tokens per minute for ${Model}** values in [Amazon Bedrock service quotas](../../../general/latest/gr/bedrock.md#limits_bedrock "../../../general/latest/gr/bedrock.md#limits_bedrock") in the _AWS General
  Reference_.

## IAM policy requirements for Geographic cross-Region inference

To allow an IAM user or role to invoke a Geographic cross-Region inference
profile, you need to allow access to the following resources:

1. The geography-specific cross-Region inference profile (these profiles have
   geographic prefixes such as `us`, `eu`,
   `apac`)
2. The foundation model in the source Region
3. The foundation model in all destination Regions listed in the geographic
   profile

The following example policy grants the required permissions to use the Claude
Sonnet 4.5 foundation model with a Geographic cross-Region inference profile for the
US, where the source Region is `us-east-1` and the destination Regions
are `us-east-1`, `us-east-2`, and
`us-west-2`:

```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "GrantGeoCrisInferenceProfileAccess",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "bedrock:InvokeModel",
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:bedrock:us-east-1:<ACCOUNT_ID>:inference-profile/us.anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929-v1:0"
            ]
        },
        {
            "Sid": "GrantGeoCrisModelAccess",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "bedrock:InvokeModel",
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:bedrock:us-east-1::foundation-model/anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929-v1:0",
                "arn:aws:bedrock:us-east-2::foundation-model/anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929-v1:0",
                "arn:aws:bedrock:us-west-2::foundation-model/anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929-v1:0"
            ],
            "Condition": {
                "StringEquals": {
                    "bedrock:InferenceProfileArn": "arn:aws:bedrock:us-east-1:<ACCOUNT_ID>:inference-profile/us.anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929-v1:0"
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

The first statement grants `bedrock:InvokeModel` API access to the
Geographic cross-Region inference profile for requests originating from the
requesting Region. The second statement grants `bedrock:InvokeModel` API
access to the foundation model in both the requesting Region and all destination
Regions listed in the inference profile.

## Service Control Policy requirements for Geographic cross-Region inference

Many organizations implement Regional access controls through Service Control
Policies in AWS Organizations for security and compliance. If your organization's
security policy uses SCPs to block unused Regions, you must either allow access to
all destination Regions listed in the Geographic cross-Region inference profile for
your source Region or add an inference-profile exception as described in the
following note.

If you use a Region allowlist without an inference-profile exception, you need to
understand the relationship between your source Region (where you make the API call)
and the destination Regions (where requests can be routed). Check the inference
profile documentation to identify all destination Regions for your source Region,
then ensure your SCPs allow access to all those destination Regions.

For example, if you're calling from us-east-1 (source Region) using the US Anthropic
Claude Sonnet 4.5 Geographic profile, requests can be routed to us-east-1, us-east-2,
and us-west-2 (destination Regions). If an SCP restricts access to only us-east-1
and doesn't include an inference-profile exception, cross-Region inference will
fail when trying to route to us-east-2 or us-west-2. To use the profile, either allow
all three destination Regions in your SCP or add an inference-profile
exception.

When configuring SCPs for Region exclusion, remember that blocking a destination
Region without an inference-profile exception will prevent cross-Region inference
from functioning properly, even if your source Region remains accessible. For SCP
requirements for Global cross-Region inference, see [Service Control Policy requirements for Global cross-Region inference](global-cross-region-inference.md#global-cris-scp-setup "global-cross-region-inference.md#global-cris-scp-setup").

###### Note

When a request uses a Geographic cross-Region inference profile, Amazon Bedrock
evaluates authorization for the inference profile resource, the foundation
model in the source Region, and the foundation model in each candidate
destination Region. The `bedrock:InferenceProfileArn` condition key
is populated for the foundation model resource evaluations, but not for the
inference profile resource evaluation.

Because the foundation model resource evaluations carry the destination
Regions, you can use `bedrock:InferenceProfileArn` in a Region-deny
SCP to exempt cross-Region routing without adding those destination Regions to
the Region allowlist for other services and actions. This exemption can't
bypass the Region restriction on the originating call. The inference profile
resource evaluation carries the source Region and doesn't include
`bedrock:InferenceProfileArn`.

To improve security, consider using the `bedrock:InferenceProfileArn`
condition to limit the exception to specific inference profiles.

## Use Geographic cross-Region inference

To use Geographic cross-Region inference, you include an [inference profile](inference-profiles.md "inference-profiles.md") when running model
inference in the following ways:

- **On-demand model inference** – Specify
  the ID of the inference profile as the `modelId` when sending an
  [InvokeModel](../APIReference/API_runtime_InvokeModel.md "../APIReference/API_runtime_InvokeModel.md"), [InvokeModelWithResponseStream](../APIReference/API_runtime_InvokeModelWithResponseStream.md "../APIReference/API_runtime_InvokeModelWithResponseStream.md"), [Converse](../APIReference/API_runtime_Converse.md "../APIReference/API_runtime_Converse.md"), or [ConverseStream](../APIReference/API_runtime_ConverseStream.md "../APIReference/API_runtime_ConverseStream.md") request.
  An inference profile defines one or more Regions to which it can route
  inference requests originating from your source Region. Cross-Region
  inference routes requests by using compute across the
  Regions defined in the inference profile. For more
  information, see [Making inference requests](inference.md "inference.md")
- **Batch inference** – Submit requests
  asynchronously with batch inference by specifying the ID of the inference
  profile as the `modelId` when sending a [CreateModelInvocationJob](../APIReference/API_CreateModelInvocationJob.md "../APIReference/API_CreateModelInvocationJob.md") request.
  Using an inference profile lets you use compute across multiple
  AWS Regions. After
  the job is complete, you can retrieve the output files from the Amazon S3 bucket
  in the source Region.
- **Agents** – Specify the ID of the
  inference profile in the `foundationModel` field in a
  [CreateAgent](../APIReference/API_agent_CreateAgent.md "../APIReference/API_agent_CreateAgent.md") request. For more information, see [Create and configure agent manually](agents-create.md "agents-create.md").
- **Knowledge base response generation**
  – You can use cross-Region inference when generating a response after
  querying a knowledge base. For more information, see [Test your knowledge base with queries and responses](knowledge-base-test.md "knowledge-base-test.md").
- **Model evaluation** – You can submit
  an inference profile as a model to evaluate when submitting a model
  evaluation job. For more information, see [Evaluate the performance of Amazon Bedrock resources](evaluation.md "evaluation.md").
- **Prompt management** – You can use cross-Region
  inference when generating a response for a prompt you created in Prompt management. For
  more information, see [Construct and store reusable prompts with Prompt management in Amazon Bedrock](prompt-management.md "prompt-management.md")
- **Prompt flows** – You can use
  cross-Region inference when generating a response for a prompt you define
  inline in a prompt node in a prompt flow. For more information, see [Build an end-to-end generative AI workflow with Amazon Bedrock Flows](flows.md "flows.md").
