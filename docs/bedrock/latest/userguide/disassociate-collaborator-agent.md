      [https://console.aws.amazon.com/bedrock](https://console.aws.amazon.com/bedrock "https://console.aws.amazon.com/bedrock").
   2. Select **Agents** from the left navigation pane. Then, choose an agent in the **Agents** section.
   3. Choose **Edit in Agent builder**.

2. In the **Agent builder**, scroll down to the **Multi-agent collaboration** section and choose **Edit**.
3. In the **Multi-agent collaboration** page, choose **Expand all**.
4. In the **Agent collaborator** sections, go to the collaborator agent section you want to disassociate and choose the trash can icon.
5. After you've finished disassociating collaborator agents, choose **Save** and then **Prepare** to test your updated multi-agent collaboration configurations.

API
To disassociate a collaborator agent, send an
`DisassociateAgentCollaborator` request with an [Agents for Amazon Bedrock build-time endpoint](../../../general/latest/gr/bedrock.md#bra-bt "../../../general/latest/gr/bedrock.md#bra-bt").
Because all fields will be overwritten, include both fields that you want to update as well as fields that you want to keep the same..

To apply the changes to the working draft, send a [PrepareAgent](../APIReference/API_agent_PrepareAgent.md "../APIReference/API_agent_PrepareAgent.md") request with an [Agents for Amazon Bedrock build-time endpoint](../../../general/latest/gr/bedrock.md#bra-bt "../../../general/latest/gr/bedrock.md#bra-bt"). Include the `agentId` in the request. The changes apply to the `DRAFT` version, which the `TSTALIASID` alias points to.

You must minimally include the following fields:

| Field          | Use case                   |
| -------------- | -------------------------- |
| agentId        | The agent ID.              |
| agentVersion   | The agent version.         |
| collaboratorId | The collaborator agent ID. |
