End of support notice: On November 13, 2025, AWS will discontinue support
for AWS Elemental MediaStore. After November 13, 2025, you will no longer be able to access the MediaStore console
or MediaStore resources. For more information, visit this

# Troubleshooting AWS Elemental MediaStore identity and

access

Use the following information to help you diagnose and fix common issues that you might
encounter when working with MediaStore and IAM.

  perform an action in MediaStore](#security_iam_troubleshoot-no-permissions "#security_iam_troubleshoot-no-permissions")
- [I am not authorized to perform

## I am not authorized to

perform an action in MediaStore

If you receive an error that you're not authorized to perform an action, your
policies must be updated to allow you to perform the action.

The following example error occurs when the `mateojackson` IAM user
tries to use the console to view details about a fictional
`my-example-widget` resource but doesn't
have the fictional `mediastore:`GetWidget`` permissions.

```
User: arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/mateojackson is not authorized to perform: mediastore:GetWidget on resource: my-example-widget
```

In this case, the policy for the `mateojackson` user must be updated to allow access to the
`my-example-widget` resource by using the
`mediastore:`GetWidget`` action.

If you need help, contact your AWS administrator. Your administrator is the person who provided you with your sign-in credentials.

## I am not authorized to perform

iam:PassRole

If you receive an error that you're not authorized to perform the `iam:PassRole` action, your policies must be updated to allow you to pass a role to MediaStore.

Some AWS services allow you to pass an existing role to that service instead of creating a new service role or service-linked role. To do
this, you must have permissions to pass the role to the service.

The following example error occurs when an IAM user named `marymajor` tries to use the console to perform an action in
MediaStore. However, the action requires the service to have permissions that are granted by a service role. Mary does not have permissions to pass the
role to the service.

```
User: arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/`marymajor` is not authorized to perform: iam:PassRole
```

In this case, Mary's policies must be updated to allow her to perform the `iam:PassRole` action.

If you need help, contact your AWS administrator. Your administrator is the person who provided you with your sign-in credentials.

## I want to allow people

outside of my AWS account to access my MediaStore resources

You can create a role that users in other accounts or people outside of your organization can use to access your resources. You can specify who
is trusted to assume the role. For services that support resource-based policies or access control lists (ACLs), you can use those policies to grant
people access to your resources.
