# Infrastructure security in AWS App Mesh

###### Important

End of support notice: On September 30, 2026, AWS will discontinue support for AWS App Mesh. After September 30, 2026, you will no longer be able to access the AWS App Mesh console or AWS App Mesh resources. For more information, visit this blog post [Migrating from AWS App Mesh to Amazon ECS Service Connect](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/containers/migrating-from-aws-app-mesh-to-amazon-ecs-service-connect "https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/containers/migrating-from-aws-app-mesh-to-amazon-ecs-service-connect").

As a managed service, AWS App Mesh is protected by AWS global network security. For
information about AWS security services and how AWS protects infrastructure, see [AWS Cloud Security](https://aws.amazon.com/security/ "https://aws.amazon.com/security/"). To design your AWS
environment using the best practices for infrastructure security, see [Infrastructure
Protection](../../../wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/infrastructure-protection.md "../../../wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/infrastructure-protection.md") in _Security Pillar AWS Well‐Architected
Framework_.

You use AWS published API calls to access App Mesh through the network. Clients must
support the following:

- Transport Layer Security (TLS). We require TLS 1.2 and recommend TLS 1.3.
- Cipher suites with perfect forward secrecy (PFS) such as DHE (Ephemeral
  Diffie-Hellman) or ECDHE (Elliptic Curve Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman). Most modern systems
  such as Java 7 and later support these modes.
  You can improve the security posture of your VPC by configuring App Mesh to use an interface
  VPC endpoint. For more information, see [App Mesh interface VPC endpoints (AWS PrivateLink)](vpc-endpoints.md "vpc-endpoints.md").
