# Options

Indicates how your transfer task is configured. These options include how DataSync handles files, objects, and their associated metadata during your transfer. You
also can specify how to verify data integrity, set bandwidth limits for your task, among other
options.

Each option has a default value. Unless you need to, you don't have to configure any
option before calling [StartTaskExecution](API_StartTaskExecution.md "API_StartTaskExecution.md").

You also can override your task options for each task execution. For example, you might
want to adjust the `LogLevel` for an individual execution.

## Contents

**Atime**

Specifies whether to preserve metadata indicating the last time a file was read or
written to.

###### Note

The behavior of `Atime` isn't fully standard across platforms, so DataSync can only do this on a best-effort basis.

- `BEST_EFFORT` (default) - DataSync attempts to preserve the
  original `Atime` attribute on all source files (that is, the version before the
  `PREPARING` steps of the task execution). This option is
  recommended.
- `NONE` - Ignores `Atime`.

###### Note

If `Atime` is set to `BEST_EFFORT`, `Mtime` must be set
to `PRESERVE`.

If `Atime` is set to `NONE`, `Mtime` must also be
`NONE`.

Type: String

Valid Values: `NONE | BEST_EFFORT`

Required: No

**BytesPerSecond**

Limits the bandwidth used by a DataSync task. For example, if you want
DataSync to use a maximum of 1 MB, set this value to `1048576`
(`=1024*1024`).

###### Note

Not applicable to [Enhanced mode
tasks](choosing-task-mode.md "choosing-task-mode.md").

Type: Long

Valid Range: Minimum value of -1.

Required: No

**Gid**

Specifies the POSIX group ID (GID) of the file's owners.

- `INT_VALUE` (default) - Preserves the integer value of user ID (UID) and
  GID, which is recommended.
- `NONE` - Ignores UID and GID.

For more information, see [Understanding how DataSync handles file and object
metadata](metadata-copied.md "metadata-copied.md").

Type: String

Valid Values: `NONE | INT_VALUE | NAME | BOTH`

Required: No

**LogLevel**

Specifies the type of logs that DataSync publishes to a Amazon CloudWatch Logs
log group. To specify the log group, see [CloudWatchLogGroupArn](API_CreateTask.md#DataSync-CreateTask-request-CloudWatchLogGroupArn "API_CreateTask.md#DataSync-CreateTask-request-CloudWatchLogGroupArn").

- `BASIC` - Publishes logs with only basic information (such as transfer
  errors).
- `TRANSFER` - Publishes logs for all files or objects that your DataSync task transfers and performs data-integrity checks on.
- `OFF` - No logs are published.

Type: String

Valid Values: `OFF | BASIC | TRANSFER`

Required: No

**Mtime**

Specifies whether to preserve metadata indicating the last time that a file was written
to before the `PREPARING` step of your task execution. This option is required when
you need to run the a task more than once.

- `PRESERVE` (default) - Preserves original `Mtime`, which is
  recommended.
- `NONE` - Ignores `Mtime`.

###### Note

If `Mtime` is set to `PRESERVE`, `Atime` must be set to
`BEST_EFFORT`.

If `Mtime` is set to `NONE`, `Atime` must also be set
to `NONE`.

Type: String

Valid Values: `NONE | PRESERVE`

Required: No

**ObjectTags**

Specifies whether you want DataSync to `PRESERVE` object tags
(default behavior) when transferring between object storage systems. If you want your DataSync task to ignore object tags, specify the `NONE` value.

Type: String

Valid Values: `PRESERVE | NONE`

Required: No

**OverwriteMode**

Specifies whether DataSync should modify or preserve data at the destination
location.

- `ALWAYS` (default) - DataSync modifies data in the destination
  location when source data (including metadata) has changed.

If DataSync overwrites objects, you might incur additional charges for
certain Amazon S3 storage classes (for example, for retrieval or early deletion).
For more information, see [Storage
class considerations with Amazon S3 transfers](create-s3-location.md#using-storage-classes "create-s3-location.md#using-storage-classes").

- `NEVER` - DataSync doesn't overwrite data in the destination
  location even if the source data has changed. You can use this option to protect against
  overwriting changes made to files or objects in the destination.

Type: String

Valid Values: `ALWAYS | NEVER`

Required: No

**PosixPermissions**

Specifies which users or groups can access a file for a specific purpose such as reading,
writing, or execution of the file.

For more information, see [Understanding how DataSync handles file and object
metadata](metadata-copied.md "metadata-copied.md").

- `PRESERVE` (default) - Preserves POSIX-style permissions, which is
  recommended.
- `NONE` - Ignores POSIX-style permissions.

###### Note

DataSync can preserve extant permissions of a source location.

Type: String

Valid Values: `NONE | PRESERVE`

Required: No

**PreserveDeletedFiles**

Specifies whether files in the destination location that don't exist in the source
should be preserved. This option can affect your Amazon S3 storage cost. If your task
deletes objects, you might incur minimum storage duration charges for certain storage classes.
For detailed information, see [Considerations
when working with Amazon S3 storage classes in DataSync](create-s3-location.md#using-storage-classes "create-s3-location.md#using-storage-classes").

- `PRESERVE` (default) - Ignores such destination files, which is
  recommended.
- `REMOVE` - Deletes destination files that aren’t present in the
  source.

###### Note

If you set this parameter to `REMOVE`, you can't set
`TransferMode` to `ALL`. When you transfer all data, DataSync doesn't scan your destination location and doesn't know what to delete.

Type: String

Valid Values: `PRESERVE | REMOVE`

Required: No

**PreserveDevices**

Specifies whether DataSync should preserve the metadata of block and
character devices in the source location and recreate the files with that device name and
metadata on the destination. DataSync copies only the name and metadata of such
devices.

###### Note

DataSync can't copy the actual contents of these devices because they're
nonterminal and don't return an end-of-file (EOF) marker.

- `NONE` (default) - Ignores special devices (recommended).
- `PRESERVE` - Preserves character and block device metadata. This option
  currently isn't supported for Amazon EFS.

Type: String

Valid Values: `NONE | PRESERVE`

Required: No

**SecurityDescriptorCopyFlags**

Specifies which components of the SMB security descriptor are copied from source to
destination objects.

This value is only used for transfers between SMB and Amazon FSx for Windows File Server
locations or between two FSx for Windows File Server locations. For more information, see [Understanding how
DataSync handles file and object metadata](metadata-copied.md "metadata-copied.md").

- `OWNER_DACL` (default) - For each copied object, DataSync copies
  the following metadata:
  - The object owner.
  - NTFS discretionary access control lists (DACLs), which determine whether to grant
    access to an object.

  DataSync won't copy NTFS system access control lists (SACLs) with this
  option.

- `OWNER_DACL_SACL` - For each copied object, DataSync copies the
  following metadata:
  - The object owner.
  - NTFS discretionary access control lists (DACLs), which determine whether to grant
    access to an object.
  - SACLs, which are used by administrators to log attempts to access a secured
    object.

  Copying SACLs requires granting additional permissions to the Windows user that
  DataSync uses to access your SMB location. For information about choosing
  a user with the right permissions, see required permissions for [SMB](create-smb-location.md#configuring-smb-permissions "create-smb-location.md#configuring-smb-permissions"), [FSx for Windows File Server](create-fsx-location.md#create-fsx-windows-location-permissions "create-fsx-location.md#create-fsx-windows-location-permissions"), or [FSx for ONTAP](create-ontap-location.md#create-ontap-location-smb "create-ontap-location.md#create-ontap-location-smb") (depending on the type of
  location in your transfer).

- `NONE` - None of the SMB security descriptor components are copied.
  Destination objects are owned by the user that was provided for accessing the destination
  location. DACLs and SACLs are set based on the destination server’s configuration.

Type: String

Valid Values: `NONE | OWNER_DACL | OWNER_DACL_SACL`

Required: No

**TaskQueueing**

Specifies whether your transfer tasks should be put into a queue during certain scenarios
when [running multiple
tasks](run-task.md#running-multiple-tasks "run-task.md#running-multiple-tasks"). This is `ENABLED` by default.

Type: String

Valid Values: `ENABLED | DISABLED`

Required: No

**TransferMode**

Specifies whether DataSync transfers only the data (including metadata) that
differs between locations following an initial copy or transfers all data every time you run
the task. If you're planning on recurring transfers, you might only want to transfer what's
changed since your previous task execution.

- `CHANGED` (default) - After your initial full transfer, DataSync
  copies only the data and metadata that differs between the source and destination
  location.
- `ALL` - DataSync copies everything in the source to the
  destination without comparing differences between the locations.

Type: String

Valid Values: `CHANGED | ALL`

Required: No

**Uid**

Specifies the POSIX user ID (UID) of the file's owner.

- `INT_VALUE` (default) - Preserves the integer value of UID and group ID
  (GID), which is recommended.
- `NONE` - Ignores UID and GID.

For more information, see [Metadata copied by DataSync](special-files.md#metadata-copied "special-files.md#metadata-copied").

Type: String

Valid Values: `NONE | INT_VALUE | NAME | BOTH`

Required: No

**VerifyMode**

Specifies if and how DataSync checks the integrity of your data at the end of
your transfer.

- `ONLY_FILES_TRANSFERRED` (recommended) - DataSync calculates
  the checksum of transferred data (including metadata) at the source location. At the end
  of the transfer, DataSync then compares this checksum to the checksum calculated
  on that data at the destination.

###### Note

This is the default option for [Enhanced mode
tasks](choosing-task-mode.md "choosing-task-mode.md").

We recommend this option when transferring to S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval
or S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage classes. For more information, see
[Storage
class considerations with Amazon S3 locations](create-s3-location.md#using-storage-classes "create-s3-location.md#using-storage-classes").

- `POINT_IN_TIME_CONSISTENT` - At the end of the transfer, DataSync checks the entire source and destination to verify that both locations are
  fully synchronized.

###### Note

The is the default option for [Basic mode tasks](choosing-task-mode.md "choosing-task-mode.md") and
isn't currently supported with Enhanced mode tasks.

If you use a [manifest](transferring-with-manifest.md "transferring-with-manifest.md"),
DataSync only scans and verifies what's listed in the manifest.

You can't use this option when transferring to S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval
or S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage classes. For more information, see
[Storage
class considerations with Amazon S3 locations](create-s3-location.md#using-storage-classes "create-s3-location.md#using-storage-classes").

- `NONE` - DataSync performs data integrity checks only during
  your transfer. Unlike other options, there's no additional verification at the end of your
  transfer.

Type: String

Valid Values: `POINT_IN_TIME_CONSISTENT | ONLY_FILES_TRANSFERRED | NONE`

Required: No
