<a name="sqs-configure-dead-letter-queue-redrive"></a>

Use dead-letter queue redrive to move unconsumed messages from a dead-letter queue to another destination for processing. By default, dead-letter queue redrive moves messages from a dead-letter queue to a source queue. However, you can also configure any other queue as the redrive destination if both queues are the same type. For example, if the dead-letter queue is a FIFO queue, the redrive destination queue must be a FIFO queue as well. Additionally, you can configure the redrive velocity to set the rate at which Amazon SQS moves messages.

**Note**  
 When a message is moved from a FIFO queue to a FIFO DLQ, the original message's deduplication ID will be replaced with the original message's ID. This is to make sure that the DLQ deduplication will not prevent storing of two independent messages that happen to share a deduplication ID. 

 Dead-letter queues redrive messages in the order they are received, starting with the oldest message. However, the destination queue ingests the redriven messages, as well as new messages from other producers, according to the order in which it receives them. For example, if a producer is sending messages to a source FIFO queue when simultaneously receiving redriven messages from a dead letter queue, the redriven messages will interweave with the new messages from the producer. 

**Note**  
The redrive task resets the retention period. All redriven messages are considered new messages with a new `messageID` and `enqueueTime` are assigned to redriven messages. 

## Configuring a dead-letter queue redrive for an existing standard queue using the Amazon SQS API
<a name="sqs-configure-dead-letter-queue-redrive-API"></a>

 You can configure a dead-letter queue redrive using the `StartMessageMoveTask`, `ListMessageMoveTasks`, and `CancelMessageMoveTask` API actions: 


| API action | Description | 
| --- | --- | 
| [`StartMessageMoveTask`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/APIReference/API_StartMessageMoveTask.html) | Starts an asynchronous task to move messages from a specified source queue to a specified destination queue. | 
| [`ListMessageMoveTasks`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/APIReference/API_ListMessageMoveTasks.html) | Gets the most recent message movement tasks (up to 10) under a specific source queue. | 
| [`CancelMessageMoveTask`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/APIReference/API_CancelMessageMoveTask.html) | Cancels a specified message movement task. A message movement can only be cancelled when the current status is RUNNING. | 

## Configuring a dead-letter queue redrive for an existing standard queue using the Amazon SQS console
<a name="sqs-configure-dead-letter-queue-redrive-console"></a>

1. Open the Amazon SQS console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/sqs/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/sqs/).

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Queues**.

1. Choose the name of queue that you have configured as a [dead-letter queue](sqs-configure-dead-letter-queue.md).

1. Choose **Start DLQ redrive**.

1. Under **Redrive configuration**, for **Message destination**, do either of the following:
   + To redrive messages to their source queue, choose **Redrive to source queue(s)**.
   + To redrive messages to another queue, choose **Redrive to custom destination**. Then, enter the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an existing destination queue.

1. Under **Velocity control settings**, choose one of the following:
   + **System optimized** - Redrive dead-letter queue messages at the maximum number of messages per second.
   + **Custom max velocity** - Redrive dead-letter queue messages with a custom maximum rate of messages per second. The maximum allowed rate is 500 messages per second. 
     + It is recommended to start with a small value for Custom max velocity and verify that the source queue doesn't get overwhelmed with messages. From there, gradually ramp-up the Custom max velocity value, continuing to monitor the state of the source queue.

1. When you finish configuring the dead-letter queue redrive, choose **Redrive messages**.
**Important**  
Amazon SQS doesn't support filtering and modifying messages while redriving them from the dead-letter queue.  
A dead-letter queue redrive task can run a maximum of 36 hours. Amazon SQS supports a maximum of 100 active redrive tasks per account.

1. If you want to cancel the message redrive task, on the **Details** page for your queue, choose **Cancel DLQ redrive**. When canceling an in progress message redrive, any messages that have already been successfully moved to their move destination queue will remain in the destination queue.

## Configuring queue permissions for dead-letter queue redrive
<a name="sqs-configure-dead-letter-queue-redrive-permissions"></a>

You can give user access to specific dead-letter queue actions by adding permissions to your policy. The minimum required permissions for a dead-letter queue redrive are as follows:


| Minimum Permissions | Required API methods | 
| --- | --- | 
| To start a message redrive | +  Add the `sqs:StartMessageMoveTask`, `sqs:ReceiveMessage`, `sqs:DeleteMessage`, and `sqs:GetQueueAttributes` of the dead-letter queue. If either the dead-letter queue or the original source queue are encrypted (also known as an [SSE](sqs-server-side-encryption.md) queue), `kms:Decrypt` for any KMS key that has been used to encrypt the messages is also required. <br />+  Add the `sqs:SendMessage` of the destination queue. If the destination queue is encrypted, `kms:GenerateDataKey` and `kms:Decrypt`are also required.  | 
| To cancel an in-progress message redrive | +  Add the `sqs:CancelMessageMoveTask`, `sqs:ReceiveMessage`, `sqs:DeleteMessage`, and `sqs:GetQueueAttributes` of the dead-letter queue. If the dead-letter queue is encrypted (also known as an [SSE](sqs-server-side-encryption.md) queue), `kms:Decrypt` is also required.  | 
| To show a message move status | +  Add the `sqs:ListMessageMoveTasks` and `sqs:GetQueueAttributes` of the dead-letter queue.  | 

**To configure permissions for an encrypted queue pair (a source queue with a dead-letter queue)**

Use the following steps to configure minimum permissions for a dead-letter queue (DLQ) redrive:

1. Open the IAM console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/).

1. In the navigation pane, select **Policies**.

1. Create a new [**policy**](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_create.html) and add the following permissions. Attach the policy to the IAM [user](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_users.html) or [role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles.html) that will perform the redrive operation.
   + Permissions for the DLQ (source queue):
     + `sqs:StartMessageMoveTask`
     + `sqs:CancelMessageMoveTask`
     + `sqs:ListMessageMoveTasks`
     + `sqs:ReceiveMessage`
     + `sqs:DeleteMessage`
     + `sqs:GetQueueAttributes`
     + `sqs:ListDeadLetterSourceQueues`
     + Specify the **Resource ARN** of the DLQ (source queue) (for example, "arn:aws:sqs:{{<DLQ\_region>}}:{{<DLQ\_accountId>}}:{{<DLQ\_name>}}"). 
   + Permissions for destination queue:
     + `sqs:SendMessage`
     + Specify the `Resource ARN` of the destination queue (for example, "arn:aws:sqs:{{<DestQueue\_region>:<DestQueue\_accountId>:<DestQueue\_name>}}").
   + Permissions for KMS keys:
     + `kms:Decrypt` (Needed to decrypt messages in the DLQ.)
     + `kms:GenerateDataKey` (Needed to encrypt messages in the destination queue.)
       + `Resource` ARNs:
         + The ARN of the KMS key used to encrypt messages in the **DLQ** (source queue) (for example, "arn:aws:kms:{{<region>}}:{{<accountId>}}:key/{{<SourceQueueKeyId>}}").
         + The ARN of the KMS key used to encrypt messages in the **destination queue** (for example, "arn:aws:kms:{{<region>}}:{{<accountId>}}:key/{{<DestinationQueueKeyId>}}").

   Your access policy should resemble the following:

**To configure permissions using a non-encrypted queue pair (a source queue with a dead-letter queue)**

Follow these steps to configure the minimum permissions required for handling a standard, **unencrypted** dead-letter queue (DLQ). Required minimum permissions are to *receive*, *delete* and *get* attributes from the dead-letter queue, and *send* attributes to the source queue. 

1. Open the IAM console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/).

1. In the navigation pane, select **Policies**.

1. Create a new [**policy**](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_create.html) and add the following permissions. Attach the policy to the IAM [user](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_users.html) or [role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles.html) that will perform the redrive operation.
   + Permissions for the DLQ (source queue):
     + `sqs:StartMessageMoveTask`
     + `sqs:CancelMessageMoveTask`
     + `sqs:ListMessageMoveTasks`
     + `sqs:ReceiveMessage`
     + `sqs:DeleteMessage`

## Using dead-letter queue redrive with VPC endpoint access control
<a name="using-dlq-redrive-with-vpc-endpoint-access-control"></a>

 When you restrict queue access to specific VPCs using the `aws:sourceVpc` condition, you need to make an exception for AWS services to enable dead-letter queue (DLQ) redrive functionality. This is because the Amazon SQS service operates outside your VPC when moving messages. 

 To allow DLQ redrive operations, add the `aws:CalledViaLast` condition to your queue policy. This allows Amazon SQS to make API calls on your behalf while maintaining VPC restrictions for direct access. 

 To allow both VPC-restricted access and DLQ redrive: 

1. Use the `aws:CalledViaLast` condition in your queue policy.

1. Apply the policy to both the source queue and the DLQ

1. Maintain VPC restrictions for direct access from other sources

 Here is an example policy that implements these requirements: 

------
#### [ JSON ]

****  

```
{
  "Version":"2012-10-17",		 	 	 
  "Id": "SQSRedriveWithVpcRestriction",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "DenyOutsideVPCUnlessAWSService_DestQueue",
      "Effect": "Deny",
      "Principal": "*",
      "Action": "sqs:*",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:sqs:*:111122223333:DestQueue",
      "Condition": {
        "StringNotEquals": {
          "aws:SourceVpc": "vpc-1234567890abcdef0"
        },
        "StringNotEqualsIfExists": { 
          "aws:CalledViaLast": "sqs.amazonaws.com"
        }
      }
    },
    {
      "Sid": "DenyOutsideVPCUnlessAWSService_DLQ",
      "Effect": "Deny",
      "Principal": "*",
      "Action": "sqs:*",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:sqs:*:111122223333:Dlq",
      "Condition": {
        "StringNotEquals": {
          "aws:SourceVpc": "vpc-1234567890abcdef0"
        },
        "StringNotEqualsIfExists": { 
          "aws:CalledViaLast": "sqs.amazonaws.com"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

------
+ Replace the placeholder values with your actual values
+ This policy uses a "deny" statement with conditions, which is more secure than using "allow" statements
+ The `StringNotEqualsIfExists` operator handles cases where the condition key might not be present in the request context. 

 Alternatively, you can use the `aws:ViaAWSService` condition key to allow service-based access while maintaining VPC restrictions. This condition key indicates whether the request comes from an AWS service. Here is an example policy that uses `aws:ViaAWSService` instead of `aws:CalledViaLast`: 

------

  "Version":"2012-10-17",		 	 	 
  "Id": "SQSRedriveWithVpcRestriction",

    {
      "Sid": "DenyOutsideVPCUnlessAWSService_DestQueue",
      "Effect": "Deny",
      "Principal": "*",
      "Action": "sqs:*",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:sqs:*:111122223333:DestQueue",
      "Condition": {
        "StringNotEquals": {
          "aws:SourceVpc": "vpc-1234567890abcdef0"
        },
        "BoolIfExists": {
          "aws:ViaAWSService": "false"
        }
      }
    },
    {
      "Sid": "DenyOutsideVPCUnlessAWSService_DLQ",
      "Effect": "Deny",
      "Principal": "*",
      "Action": "sqs:*",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:sqs:*:111122223333:Dlq",
      "Condition": {
        "StringNotEquals": {
          "aws:SourceVpc": "vpc-1234567890abcdef0"
        },
        "BoolIfExists": {
          "aws:ViaAWSService": "false"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

------

The BoolIfExists operator with `aws:ViaAWSService` condition ensures that requests are allowed when they come from services while maintaining VPC restrictions for direct access. This can be simpler to understand and maintain, as it directly checks if the request is made by an AWS service rather than checking which service made the last call. 

 For more information on condition keys used in IAM and resource policies, see IAM JSON policy elements: Condition.
