# Create an EventBridge rule for

a CodeCommit source (CLI)

Call the **put-rule** command, specifying:

- A name that uniquely identifies the rule you are creating. This name must
  be unique across all of the pipelines you create with CodePipeline associated with
  your AWS account.
- The event pattern for the source and detail fields used by the rule. For
  more information, see [Amazon EventBridge and Event Patterns](../../../eventbridge/latest/userguide/eb-events.md "../../../eventbridge/latest/userguide/eb-events.md").

###### To create an EventBridge rule with CodeCommit as the event

source and CodePipeline as the target

1. Add permissions for EventBridge to use CodePipeline to invoke the rule. For more information, see
   [Using resource-based policies for Amazon EventBridge](../../../eventbridge/latest/userguide/eb-use-resource-based.md "../../../eventbridge/latest/userguide/eb-use-resource-based.md").
   1. Use the following sample to create the trust policy that allows EventBridge to assume
      the service role. Name the trust policy
      `trustpolicyforEB.json`.

   JSON

   ```
   `{
    "Version":"2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
    {
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Principal": {
    "Service": "events.amazonaws.com"
    },
    "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
    }
    ]
   }`

   ```

   2. Use the following command to create the `Role-for-MyRule` role and
      attach the trust policy.

   ```
   aws iam create-role --role-name Role-for-MyRule --assume-role-policy-document file://trustpolicyforEB.json
   ```

   3. Create the permissions policy JSON, as shown in this sample, for the pipeline
      named `MyFirstPipeline`. Name the permissions policy
      `permissionspolicyforEB.json`.

   JSON

   ```
   `{
    "Version":"2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
    {
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Action": [
    "codepipeline:StartPipelineExecution"
    ],
    "Resource": [
    "arn:aws:codepipeline:us-west-2:`111122223333`:MyFirstPipeline"
    ]
    }
    ]
   }`

   ```

   4. Use the following command to attach the
      `CodePipeline-Permissions-Policy-for-EB` permissions policy to
      the `Role-for-MyRule` role.

   **Why am I making this change?** Adding this
   policy to the role creates permissions for EventBridge.

   ```
   aws iam put-role-policy --role-name Role-for-MyRule --policy-name CodePipeline-Permissions-Policy-For-EB --policy-document file://permissionspolicyforEB.json
   ```

2. Call the **put-rule** command and include the `--name`,
   `--event-pattern` , and`--role-arn` parameters.

**Why am I making this change?** This command enables
AWS CloudFormation to create the event.

The following sample command creates a rule called
`MyCodeCommitRepoRule`.

```
aws events put-rule --name "MyCodeCommitRepoRule" --event-pattern "{\"source\":[\"aws.codecommit\"],\"detail-type\":[\"CodeCommit Repository State Change\"],\"resources\":[\"`repository-ARN`\"],\"detail\":{\"referenceType\":[\"branch\"],\"referenceName\":[\"`main`\"]}}" --role-arn "arn:aws:iam::`ACCOUNT_ID`:role/Role-for-MyRule"
```

3.  To add CodePipeline as a target, call the **put-targets** command and include
    the following parameters:

        * The `--rule` parameter is used with the `rule_name` you
         created by using **put-rule**.
        * The `--targets` parameter is used with the list `Id` of
         the target in the list of targets and the `ARN` of the target
         pipeline.

    The following sample command specifies that for the rule called
    `MyCodeCommitRepoRule`, the target `Id` is composed of the
    number one, indicating that in a list of targets for the rule, this is target 1. The
    sample command also specifies an example `ARN` for the pipeline. The pipeline
    starts when something changes in the repository.

```
aws events put-targets --rule MyCodeCommitRepoRule --targets Id=1,Arn=arn:aws:codepipeline:us-west-2:80398EXAMPLE:TestPipeline
```

4. (Optional) To configure an input transformer with source overrides for a specific
   image ID, use the following JSON in your CLI command. The following example configures
   an override where:
   - The `actionName`, `Source` in this example, is the
     dynamic value, defined at pipeline creation, not derived from the source
     event.
   - The `revisionType`, `COMMIT_ID` in this example, is the
     dynamic value, defined at pipeline creation, not derived from the source
     event.
   - The `revisionValue`, <`revisionValue`>
     in this example, is derived from the source event variable.

```
{
    "Rule": "my-rule",
    "Targets": [
        {
            "Id": "MyTargetId",
            "Arn": "`pipeline-ARN`",
            "InputTransformer": {
                "sourceRevisions": {
                    "actionName": "`Source`",
                    "revisionType": "`COMMIT_ID`",
                    "revisionValue": "<`revisionValue`>"
                },
                "variables": [
                    {
                        "name": "`Branch_Name`",
                        "value": "`value`"
                    }
                ]
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

###### To edit your pipeline's PollForSourceChanges

parameter

###### Important

When you create a pipeline with this method, the `PollForSourceChanges`
parameter defaults to true if it is not explicitly set to false. When you add
event-based change detection, you must add the parameter to your output and set it to
false to disable polling. Otherwise, your pipeline starts twice for a single source
change. For details, see [Valid settings for the
PollForSourceChanges parameter](PollForSourceChanges-defaults.md "PollForSourceChanges-defaults.md").

1. Run the **get-pipeline** command to copy the pipeline structure into a
   JSON file. For example, for a pipeline named
   `MyFirstPipeline`, run the following command:

```
aws codepipeline get-pipeline --name `MyFirstPipeline` >`pipeline.json`
```

This command returns nothing, but the file you created should appear in the directory
where you ran the command. 2. Open the JSON file in any plain-text editor and edit the source stage by changing the
`PollForSourceChanges` parameter to `false`, as shown in this
example.

**Why am I making this change?** Changing this parameter
to `false` turns off periodic checks so you can use event-based change
detection only.

```
"configuration": {
    `"PollForSourceChanges": "*false*",`
    "BranchName": "main",
    "RepositoryName": "MyTestRepo"
},
```

3. If you are working with the pipeline structure retrieved using the
   **get-pipeline** command, remove the `metadata` lines from
   the JSON file. Otherwise, the **update-pipeline** command cannot use it.
   Remove the `"metadata": { }` lines and the `"created"`,
   `"pipelineARN"`, and `"updated"` fields.

For example, remove the following lines from the structure:

```
"metadata": {
    "pipelineArn": "arn:aws:codepipeline:`region`:`account-ID`:`pipeline-name`",
    "created": "`date`",
    "updated": "`date`"
},
```

Save the file. 4. To apply your changes, run the **update-pipeline** command, specifying
the pipeline JSON file:

###### Important

Be sure to include `file://` before the file name. It is required in this command.

```
aws codepipeline update-pipeline --cli-input-json file://`pipeline.json`
```

This command returns the entire structure of the edited pipeline.

###### Note

The **update-pipeline** command stops the pipeline. If a revision
is being run through the pipeline when you run the
**update-pipeline** command, that run is stopped. You must
manually start the pipeline to run that revision through the updated pipeline. Use
the **`start-pipeline-execution`** command to manually
start your pipeline.
