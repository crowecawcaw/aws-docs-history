# Pipeline declaration

The pipeline and metadata level of a pipeline has a basic structure that includes the
following parameters and syntax. The pipeline parameter represents the structure of
actions and stages to be performed in the pipeline.

For more information, see the [PipelineDeclaration](../APIReference/API_PipelineDeclaration.md "../APIReference/API_PipelineDeclaration.md") object in the _CodePipeline API
Guide_.

The following example shows the pipeline and metadata level of the pipeline structure
in both JSON and YAML for a V2 type pipeline.

    }
}
```

## `name`

The name of the pipeline. When you edit or update a pipeline, the pipeline name
cannot be changed.

###### Note

If you want to rename an existing pipeline, you can use the CLI
`get-pipeline` command to build a JSON file that contains your
pipeline's structure. You can then use the CLI `create-pipeline`
command to create a pipeline with that structure and give it a new name.

## `roleArn`

The IAM ARN for the CodePipeline service role, such as
arn:aws:iam::80398EXAMPLE:role/CodePipeline_Service_Role.

To use the console to view the pipeline service role ARN instead of the JSON
structure, choose your pipeline in the console, and then choose
**Settings**. Under the **General** tab, the
**Service role ARN** field displays.

## `artifactStore` OR

`artifactStores`

The `artifactStore` field contains the artifact bucket type and
location for a pipeline with all actions in the same AWS Region. If you add
actions in a Region different from your pipeline, the `artifactStores`
mapping is used to list the artifact bucket for each AWS Region where actions are
executed. When you create or edit a pipeline, you must have an artifact bucket in
the pipeline Region and then you must have one artifact bucket per Region where you
plan to execute an action.

###### Note

In the pipeline structure, you must include either `artifactStore`
or `artifactStores` in your pipeline, but you cannot use both. If you
create a cross-region action in your pipeline, you must use
`artifactStores`.

The following example shows the basic structure for a pipeline with cross-Region
actions that uses the `artifactStores` parameter:

```
    "pipeline": {
        "name": "`YourPipelineName`",
        "roleArn": "`CodePipeline_Service_Role`",
        "artifactStores": {
            "us-east-1": {
                "type": "S3",
                "location": "`S3 artifact bucket name, such as amzn-s3-demo-bucket`"
            },
            "us-west-2": {
                "type": "S3",
                "location": "`S3 artifact bucket name, such as amzn-s3-demo-bucket`"
            }
        },
        "stages": [
            {

...
```

### `type`

The location type for the artifact bucket, specified as Amazon S3.

### `location`

The name of the Amazon S3 bucket automatically generated for you the first time you
create a pipeline using the console, such as codepipeline-us-east-2-1234567890, or any
Amazon S3 bucket you provision for this purpose

## `stages`

This parameter contains the name of each stage in the pipeline. For more
information about the parameters and syntax at the stage level of the pipeline
structure, see the [StageDeclaration](../APIReference/API_StageDeclaration.md "../APIReference/API_StageDeclaration.md") object in the _CodePipeline API
Guide_.

The pipeline structure for stages has the following requirements:

- A pipeline must contain at least two stages.
- The first stage of a pipeline must contain at least one source action. It
  can contain source actions only.
- Only the first stage of a pipeline can contain source actions.
- At least one stage in each pipeline must contain an action that is not a
  source action.
- All stage names in a pipeline must be unique.
- Stage names cannot be edited in the CodePipeline console. If you edit a stage
  name by using the AWS CLI, and the stage contains an action with one or more
  secret parameters (such as an OAuth token), the value of those secret
  parameters is not preserved. You must manually enter the value of the
  parameters (which are masked by four asterisks in the JSON returned by the
  AWS CLI) and include them in the JSON structure.

###### Important

Pipelines that are inactive for longer than 30 days will have polling disabled for the pipeline.
For more information, see [pollingDisabledAt](#metadata.pollingDisabledAt "#metadata.pollingDisabledAt") in the pipeline structure reference.
For the steps to migrate your pipeline from polling to event-based change detection, see
[Change Detection Methods](change-detection-methods.md "change-detection-methods.md").

## `version`

The version number of a pipeline is automatically generated and updated every time
you update the pipeline.

## `executionMode`

You can set the pipeline execution mode so that you can specify the pipeline
behavior for consecutive runs, such as queueing, superseding, or running in parallel
mode. For more information, see [Set or change the pipeline execution mode](execution-modes.md "execution-modes.md").

###### Important

For pipelines in PARALLEL mode, stage rollback is not available. Similarly,
failure conditions with a rollback result type cannot be added to a PARALLEL
mode pipeline.

## `pipelineType`

The pipeline type specifies the available structure and features in the pipeline,
such as for a V2 type pipeline. For more information, see [Pipeline types](pipeline-types.md "pipeline-types.md").

## `variables`

Variables at the pipeline level are defined when the pipeline is created and
resolved at pipeline run time. For more information, see [Variables reference](reference-variables.md "reference-variables.md"). For a
tutorial with a pipeline-level variable that is passed at the time of the pipeline
execution, see [Tutorial: Use pipeline-level variables](tutorials-pipeline-variables.md "tutorials-pipeline-variables.md").

## `triggers`

Triggers allow you to configure your pipeline to start on a particular event type
or filtered event type, such as when a change on a particular branch or pull request
is detected. Triggers are configurable for source actions with connections that use
the `CodeStarSourceConnection` action in CodePipeline, such as GitHub,
Bitbucket, and GitLab. For more information about source actions that use
connections, see [Add third-party source providers to pipelines using CodeConnections](pipelines-connections.md "pipelines-connections.md").

For more information and more detailed examples, see [Automate starting pipelines using triggers and
filtering](pipelines-triggers.md "pipelines-triggers.md").

For filtering, regular expression patterns in glob format are supported as
detailed in [Working with glob patterns in syntax](syntax-glob.md "syntax-glob.md").

###### Note

The CodeCommit and S3 source actions require either a configured change detection resource (an EventBridge rule) or use the option to poll the repository for source changes. For pipelines with a Bitbucket, GitHub, or GitHub Enterprise Server source action, you do not have to set up a webhook or default to polling. The connections action manages change detection for you.

###### Important

Pipelines that are inactive for longer than 30 days will have polling disabled for the pipeline.
For more information, see [pollingDisabledAt](#metadata.pollingDisabledAt "#metadata.pollingDisabledAt") in the pipeline structure reference.
For the steps to migrate your pipeline from polling to event-based change detection, see
[Change Detection Methods](change-detection-methods.md "change-detection-methods.md").

### `gitConfiguration`

fields

The Git configuration for the trigger, including the event types and any
parameters for filtering by branches, file paths, tags, or pull request events.

The fields in the JSON structure are defined as follows:

- `sourceActionName`: The name of the pipeline source action
  with the Git configuration.
- `push`: Push events with filtering. These events use an OR
  operation between different push filters and an AND operation inside
  filters.
  - `branches`: The branches to filter on. Branches use
    an AND operation between includes and excludes.
    - `includes`: Patterns to filter on for
      branches that will be included. Includes use an OR
      operation.
    - `excludes`: Patterns to filter on for
      branches that will be excluded. Excludes use an OR
      operation.

  - `filePaths`: The file path names to filter on.
    - `includes`: Patterns to filter on for file
      paths that will be included. Includes use an OR
      operation.
    - `excludes`: Patterns to filter on for file
      paths that will be excluded. Excludes use an OR
      operation.

  - `tags`: The tag names to filter on.
    - `includes`: Patterns to filter on for tags
      that will be included. Includes use an OR
      operation.
    - `excludes`: Patterns to filter on for tags
      that will be excluded. Excludes use an OR
      operation.

- `pullRequest`: Pull request events with filtering on pull
  request events and pull request filters.
  - `events`: Filters on open, updated, or closed pull
    request events as specified.
  - `branches`: The branches to filter on. Branches use
    an AND operation between includes and excludes.
    - `includes`: Patterns to filter on for
      branches that will be included. Includes use an OR
      operation.
    - `excludes`: Patterns to filter on for
      branches that will be excluded. Excludes use an OR
      operation.

  - `filePaths`: The file path names to filter on.
    - `includes`: Patterns to filter on for file
      paths that will be included. Includes use an OR
      operation.
    - `excludes`: Patterns to filter on for file
      paths that will be excluded. Excludes use an OR
      operation.

The following is an example of the trigger configuration for push and pull
request event types.

```

### Event type `push` fields for include and exclude

Include and exclude behavior for levels of Git configuration fields for
**push** event types are shown in the following
list:

```
**push** `(OR operation is used between push and pullRequest or multiples)`
    **filePaths** `(AND operation is used between filePaths, branches, and tags)`
        includes `(AND operation is used between includes and excludes)`
            **/FILE.md, **/FILE2 `(OR operation is used between file path names)`
        excludes `(AND operation is used between includes and excludes)`
            **/FILE.md, **/FILE2 `(OR operation is used between file path names)`
    **branches** `(AND operation is used between filePaths, branches, and tags)`
        includes `(AND operation is used between includes and excludes)`

         excludes `(AND operation is used between includes and excludes)`
            TAG/**", "TAG2/** `(OR operation is used between tag names)`
```

### Event type `pull request` fields for include and

exclude

Include and exclude behavior for levels of Git configuration fields for
**pull request** event types are shown in the
following list:

```
**pullRequest** `(OR operation is used between push and pullRequest or multiples)`
    **events** `(AND operation is used between events, filePaths, and branches)`. Includes/excludes are N/A for pull request events.
    **filePaths** `(AND operation is used between events, filePaths, and branches)`
        includes `(AND operation is used between includes and excludes)`
            **/FILE.md, **/FILE2 `(OR operation is used between file path names)`
        excludes `(AND operation is used between includes and excludes)`
            **/FILE.md, **/FILE2 `(OR operation is used between file path names)`
    **branches** `(AND operation is used between events, filePaths, and branches)`
        includes `(AND operation is used between includes and excludes)`
            BRANCH/**", "BRANCH2/** `(OR operation is used between branch names)`
        excludes `(AND operation is used between includes and excludes)`
            BRANCH/**", "BRANCH2/** `(OR operation is used between branch names)`
```

## `metadata`

The pipeline metadata fields are distinct from the pipeline structure and cannot
be edited. When you update a pipeline, the date in the `updated` metadata
field changes automatically.

### `pipelineArn`

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the pipeline.

To use the console to view the pipeline ARN instead of the JSON structure,
choose your pipeline in the console, and then choose
**Settings**. Under the **General** tab,
the **Pipeline ARN** field displays.

### `created`

The date and time when the pipeline was created.

### `updated`

The date and time when the pipeline was last updated.

### `pollingDisabledAt`

The date and time when, for a pipeline that is configured for polling for
change detection, when polling was disabled.

Pipelines that are inactive for longer than 30 days will have polling disabled
for the pipeline.

- Inactive pipelines will have polling disabled after 30 days of no
  executions.
- Pipelines using EventBridge, CodeStar Connections, or webhooks will
  not be affected.
- Active pipelines will not be affected.

For more information, see the `pollingDisabledAt` parameter under
[PipelineMetadata](../APIReference/API_PipelineMetadata.md "../APIReference/API_PipelineMetadata.md") object in the _CodePipeline API
Guide_. For the steps to migrate your pipeline from polling to
event-based change detection, see [Change Detection Methods](change-detection-methods.md "change-detection-methods.md").
