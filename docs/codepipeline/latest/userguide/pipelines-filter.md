# Add trigger with code push or pull request event

types

You can configure filters for pipeline triggers to have pipeline executions started for
different Git events, such as tag or branch push, changes in specific file paths, a pull
request opened into a specific branch, and so on. You can use the AWS CodePipeline console or the
**create-pipeline** and **update-pipeline** commands in
the AWS CLI to configure trigger filters.

###### Note

The action configuration `BranchName` field defines a single branch, while
triggers with filters can be used for any branch or branches that you specify. For a
pipeline where triggers are used to filter branches by push or pull request, the
pipeline won't use the default `BranchName` field branch in the action
configuration. However, the branch in the `BranchName` field in the action
configuration is the default when the pipeline is started manually. For an example, see
[5: Trigger configured while default
action configuration BranchName is used for a manual start](pipelines-triggers.md#example-filter-default-manual "pipelines-triggers.md#example-filter-default-manual").

You can specify filters for the following trigger types:

- **Push**

A push trigger starts a pipeline when a change is pushed to your source
repository. The execution will use the commit from the branch that you're pushing
_to_ (that is, the destination branch). You can
filter push triggers on branches, file paths, or Git tags.

- **Pull request**

A pull request trigger starts a pipeline when a pull request is opened, updated,
or closed in your source repository. The execution will use the commit from the
source branch that you're pulling _from_ (that is,
the source branch). You can filter pull request triggers on branches and file
paths.

The supported event types for pull requests are the following. All other pull
request events are ignored.

    + Opened
    + Updated
    + Closed (merged)

###### Note

Certain pull request event behavior can differ by provider. For details, see
[Pull request events for triggers
by provider](pipelines-triggers.md#pipelines-filter-pullrequest-events "pipelines-triggers.md#pipelines-filter-pullrequest-events").
The pipeline definition allows you to combine different filters within the same push
trigger configuration. For details about the pipeline definition, see [Add filters for push and pull request event types
(CLI)](#pipelines-filter-cli "#pipelines-filter-cli"). For a list of
field definitions, see [triggers](pipeline-requirements.md#pipeline.triggers "pipeline-requirements.md#pipeline.triggers") in the _Pipeline structure reference_ in this guide.

## Add filters for push and pull request event

types (console)

You can use the console to add filters for push events and include or exclude branches
or file paths.

###### Add filters (console)

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the CodePipeline console at [http://console.aws.amazon.com/codesuite/codepipeline/home](http://console.aws.amazon.com/codesuite/codepipeline/home "http://console.aws.amazon.com/codesuite/codepipeline/home").

The names and status of all pipelines associated with your AWS account are
displayed. 2. In **Name**, choose the name of the pipeline you want to
edit. Otherwise, use these steps on the pipeline creation wizard. 3. On the pipeline details page, choose **Edit**. 4. On the **Edit** page, choose the source action you want to
edit. Choose **Edit triggers**. Choose **Specify
filter**. 5. In **Event type**, choose **Push** from the
following options.

    * Choose **Push** to start the pipeline when a change
     is pushed to your source repository. Choosing this enables the fields to
     specify filters for branches and file paths or Git tags.
    * Choose **Pull request** to start the
     pipeline when a pull request is opened, updated, or closed in your
     source repository. Choosing this enables the fields to specify filters
     for destination branches and file paths.

6. Under **Push**, in **Filter type**, choose
   one of the following options.
   - Choose **Branch** to specify the branches
     in your source repository that the trigger monitors in order to know
     when to start a workflow run. In **Include**, enter
     patterns for branch names in glob format that you want to specify for
     the trigger configuration to start your pipeline on changes in the
     specified branches. In **Exclude**, enter the regex
     patterns for branch names in glob format that you want to specify for
     the trigger configuration to ignore and to not start your pipeline on
     changes in the specified branches. See [Working with glob patterns in syntax](syntax-glob.md "syntax-glob.md") for more information.

   ###### Note

   If the include and exclude both have the same pattern, then the
   default is to exclude the pattern.

   You can use glob patterns to define your branch names. For example,
   use `main*` to match all branches beginning with
   `main`. See [Working with glob patterns in syntax](syntax-glob.md "syntax-glob.md") for more information.

   For a push trigger, specify the branches you're pushing _to_, that is, the _destination_ branches. For a pull request trigger,
   specify destination branches you're opening pull request to.
   - (Optional) Under **File paths**, specify
     file paths for your trigger. Enter the names in **Include** and **Exclude** as
     appropriate.

   You can use glob patterns to define your file path names. For example,
   use `prod*` to match all file paths beginning with
   `prod`. See [Working with glob patterns in syntax](syntax-glob.md "syntax-glob.md") for more information.
   - Choose **Tags** to configure the pipeline trigger
     configuration to start with Git tags. In **Include**,
     enter patterns for tag names in glob format that you want to specify for
     the trigger configuration to start your pipeline on release of the
     specified tag or tags. In **Exclude**, enter the regex
     patterns for tag names in glob format that you want to specify for the
     trigger configuration to ignore and to not start your pipeline on
     release of the specified tag or tags. If the include and exclude both
     have the same tag pattern, then the default is to exclude the tag
     pattern.

7. Under **Push**, in **Filter type**, choose
   one of the following options.
   - Choose **Branch** to specify the branches
     in your source repository that the trigger monitors in order to know
     when to start a workflow run. In **Include**, enter
     patterns for branch names in glob format that you want to specify for
     the trigger configuration to start your pipeline on changes in the
     specified branches. In **Exclude**, enter the regex
     patterns for branch names in glob format that you want to specify for
     the trigger configuration to ignore and to not start your pipeline on
     changes in the specified branches. See [Working with glob patterns in syntax](syntax-glob.md "syntax-glob.md") for more information.

   ###### Note

   If the include and exclude both have the same pattern, then the
   default is to exclude the pattern.

   You can use glob patterns to define your branch names. For example,
   use `main*` to match all branches beginning with
   `main`. See [Working with glob patterns in syntax](syntax-glob.md "syntax-glob.md") for more information.

   For a push trigger, specify the branches you're pushing _to_, that is, the _destination_ branches. For a pull request trigger,
   specify destination branches you're opening pull request to.
   - (Optional) Under **File paths**, specify
     file paths for your trigger. Enter the names in **Include** and **Exclude** as
     appropriate.

   You can use glob patterns to define your file path names. For example,
   use `prod*` to match all file paths beginning with
   `prod`. See [Working with glob patterns in syntax](syntax-glob.md "syntax-glob.md") for more information.
   - Choose **Pull request** to configure the pipeline
     trigger configuration to start with pull request events that you
     specify.

## Add filters for push and pull request event types

(CLI)

You can update the pipeline JSON to add filters for triggers.

To use the AWS CLI to create or update your pipeline, use the
`create-pipeline` or `update-pipeline` command.

The following example JSON structure provides a reference for the field definitions
under `create-pipeline`.

For a list of field definitions, see [triggers](pipeline-requirements.md#pipeline.triggers "pipeline-requirements.md#pipeline.triggers")
in the _Pipeline structure reference_ in this
guide.

## Add filters for push and pull request event types

(CloudFormation templates)

You can update the pipeline resource in CloudFormation to add trigger filtering.

The following example template snippet provides a YAML reference for triggers field
definitions. For a list of field definitions, see [triggers](pipeline-requirements.md#pipeline.triggers "pipeline-requirements.md#pipeline.triggers") in the _Pipeline structure
reference_ in this guide.

For a full template example for a connection source and trigger filter configuration,
see [Pipeline with two stages and trigger configuration](../../../AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-codepipeline-pipeline.md#aws-resource-codepipeline-pipeline--examples--Pipeline_with_two_stages_and_trigger_configuration "../../../AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-codepipeline-pipeline.md#aws-resource-codepipeline-pipeline--examples--Pipeline_with_two_stages_and_trigger_configuration") in the _CloudFormation User Guide_.
