# `ECRBuildAndPublish` build

action reference

This build action allows you to automate building and pushing a new image when a change
occurs in your source. This action builds based on a specified Docker file location and
pushes the image. This build action is not the same as the Amazon ECR source action in CodePipeline,
which triggers pipeline when a change occurs in your Amazon ECR source repository. For
information about that action, see [Amazon ECR source action reference](action-reference-ECR.md "action-reference-ECR.md").

This is not a source action that will trigger the pipeline. This action builds an image
and pushes it to your Amazon ECR image repository.

You must have already created an Amazon ECR repository and have added a Dockerfile to your
source code repository, such as GitHub, before you add the action to your pipeline.

###### Important

This action uses CodePipeline managed CodeBuild compute to run commands in a build environment.
Running the commands action will incur separate charges in AWS CodeBuild.

###### Note

This action is only available for V2 type pipelines.

## Action type

- Category: `Build`
- Owner: `AWS`
- Provider: `ECRBuildAndPublish`
- Version: `1`

## Configuration parameters

**ECRRepositoryName**

Required: Yes

The name of the Amazon ECR repository where the image is pushed.

**DockerFilePath**

Required: No

The location of the Docker file used to build the image. Optionally, you
can provide an alternate docker file location if not at the root
level.

###### Note

If a value for `DockerFilePath` is not specified, the value
defaults to the source repository root level.

**ImageTags**

Required: No

The tags used for the image. You can enter multiple tags as a
comma-delimited list of strings.

###### Note

If a value for `ImageTags` is not specified, the value
defaults to `latest`.

**RegistryType**

Required: No

Specifies whether the repository is public or private. Valid values are
`private | public`.

###### Note

If a value for `RegistryType` is not specified, the value
defaults to `private`.

## Input artifacts

- **Number of artifacts:**
  `1`
- **Description:** The artifact produced by the
  source action that contains the Dockerfile needed to build the image.

## Output artifacts

- **Number of artifacts:**
  `0`

## Output

variables

When configured, this action produces variables that can be referenced by the action
configuration of a downstream action in the pipeline. This action produces variables
which can be viewed as output variables, even if the action doesn't have a namespace.
You configure an action with a namespace to make those variables available to the
configuration of downstream actions.

For more information, see [Variables reference](reference-variables.md "reference-variables.md").

**ECRImageDigestId**

The `sha256` digest of the image manifest.

**ECRRepositoryName**

The name of the Amazon ECR repository where the image was pushed.

## Service role permissions:

`ECRBuildAndPublish` action

For the `ECRBuildAndPublish` action support, add the following to your
policy statement:

```
{
    "Statement": [
         {
            "Sid": "ECRRepositoryAllResourcePolicy",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "ecr:DescribeRepositories",
                "ecr:GetAuthorizationToken",
                "ecr-public:DescribeRepositories",
                "ecr-public:GetAuthorizationToken"
            ],
        "Resource": "*"
        },
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "ecr:GetAuthorizationToken",
                "ecr:InitiateLayerUpload",
                "ecr:UploadLayerPart",
                "ecr:CompleteLayerUpload",
                "ecr:PutImage",
                "ecr:GetDownloadUrlForLayer",
                "ecr:BatchCheckLayerAvailability"
            ],
            "Resource": "`PrivateECR_Resource_ARN`"
        },
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "ecr-public:GetAuthorizationToken",
                "ecr-public:DescribeRepositories",
                "ecr-public:InitiateLayerUpload",
                "ecr-public:UploadLayerPart",
                "ecr-public:CompleteLayerUpload",
                "ecr-public:PutImage",
                "ecr-public:BatchCheckLayerAvailability",
                "sts:GetServiceBearerToken"
            ],
            "Resource": "`PublicECR_Resource_ARN`"
        },
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "sts:GetServiceBearerToken"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
```

In addition, if not already added for the `Commands` action, add the
following permissions to your service role in order to view CloudWatch logs.

```
{
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Action": [
        "logs:CreateLogGroup",
        "logs:CreateLogStream",
        "logs:PutLogEvents"
    ],
    "Resource": "`resource_ARN`"
},
```

###### Note

Scope down the permissions to the pipeline resource level by using
resource-based permissions in the service role policy statement.
