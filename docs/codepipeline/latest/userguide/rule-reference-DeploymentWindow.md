# DeploymentWindow

When you create a condition, you can add the `DeploymentWindow` rule. This
section provides a reference for the rule parameters. For more information about rules and
conditions, see [How do stage conditions work?](concepts-how-it-works-conditions.md "concepts-how-it-works-conditions.md").

## Rule type

- Category: `Rule`
- Owner: `AWS`
- Provider: `DeploymentWindow`
- Version: `1`

## Configuration parameters

**Cron**

Required: Yes

The expression that defines the days and times when the deployment will be
allowed. Cron expressions are comprised of 6 required fields and one
optional field separated by white space. The cron expression fields allow
you to specify a schedule pattern with a cron expression as follows.

| Field name      | Allowed values   | Allowed special characters |
| --------------- | ---------------- | -------------------------- |
| Seconds         | N/A              | \*                         |
| Minutes         | 0-59             | ,<br>• \<br>• /            |
| Hours           | 0-23             | ,<br>• \<br>• /            |
| Day-of-month    | 1-31             | ,<br>• \<br>• ? / L W      |
| Month           | 1-12 or JAN-DEC  | ,<br>• \<br>• /            |
| Day-of-Week     | 1-7 or SUN-SAT   | ,<br>• \<br>• ? / L #      |
| Year (Optional) | empty, 1970-2199 | ,<br>• \<br>• /            |

- The '\*' character is used to specify all values. For example, "\*"
  in the minute field means "every minute".
- The '?' character is allowed for the day-of-month and day-of-week
  fields. It is used to specify 'no specific value'. This is useful
  when you need to specify something in one of the two fields, but not
  the other.
- The '-' character is used to specify ranges For example "10-12" in
  the hour field means "the hours 10, 11 and 12".
- The ',' character is used to specify additional values. For
  example "MON,WED,FRI" in the day-of-week field means "the days
  Monday, Wednesday, and Friday".
- The '/' character is used to specify increments. For example
  "0/15" in the seconds field means "the seconds 0, 15, 30, and 45".
  And "5/15" in the seconds field means "the seconds 5, 20, 35, and
  50". Specifying '\*' before the '/' is equivalent to specifying 0 is
  the value to start with.
- The 'L' character is allowed for the day-of-month and day-of-week
  fields. This character is short-hand for "last", but it has
  different meaning in each of the two fields. For example, the value
  "L" in the day-of-month field means "the last day of the month" -
  day 31 for January, day 28 for February on non-leap years. If used
  in the day-of-week field by itself, it simply means "7" or "SAT".
  But if used in the day-of-week field after another value, it means
  "the last <specified_day> day of the month" - for example "6L"
  means "the last friday of the month". You can also specify an offset
  from the last day of the month, such as "L-3" which would mean the
  third-to-last day of the calendar month.
- The 'W' character is allowed for the day-of-month field. This
  character is used to specify the weekday (Monday-Friday) nearest the
  given day. As an example, if you were to specify "15W" as the value
  for the day-of-month field, the meaning is: "the nearest weekday to
  the 15th of the month". So if the 15th is a Saturday, the trigger
  will fire on Friday the 14th. If the 15th is a Sunday, the trigger
  will fire on Monday the 16th. If the 15th is a Tuesday, then it will
  fire on Tuesday the 15th.
- The 'L' and 'W' characters can also be combined for the
  day-of-month expression to yield 'LW', which translates to "last
  weekday of the month".
- The '#' character is allowed for the day-of-week field. This
  character is used to specify "the nth" <specified_day> day of the
  month. For example, the value of "6#3" in the day-of-week field
  means the third Friday of the month (day 6 = Friday and "#3" = the
  3rd one in the month).
- The legal characters and the names of months and days of the week
  are not case sensitive.

**TimeZone**

Required: No

The time zone for the deployment window. The regular expression matches
patterns in the following formats:

- **Region/City format**. The value
  matches a time zone in the format Region/City or Region/City_City.
  For example, `America/New_York` or
  `Europe/Berlin`.
- **UTC format**. The value matches the
  string UTC optionally followed by an offset in the format +HH:MM or
  -HH:MM. For example, `UTC`, `UTC+05:30`, or
  `UTC-03:00`. This is the default format if the
  parameter is not set otherwise.
- **Abbreviation format**. The value
  matches a 3 to 5 character abbreviation for a time zone. For
  example, `EST` or `IST`.

For a table of valid TimeZoneID values, see [https://docs.oracle.com/middleware/1221/wcs/tag-ref/MISC/TimeZones.html](https://docs.oracle.com/middleware/1221/wcs/tag-ref/MISC/TimeZones.html "https://docs.oracle.com/middleware/1221/wcs/tag-ref/MISC/TimeZones.html").
Note that certain abbreviations are duplicated abbreviations, such
as CST for Central Standard Time, China Standard Time, and Cuba
Standard Time.
