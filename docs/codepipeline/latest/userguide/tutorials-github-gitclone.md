# Tutorial: Use full clone with a GitHub pipeline

source

You can choose the full clone option for your GitHub source action in CodePipeline. Use this option
to run CodeBuild commands for Git metadata in your pipeline build action.

###### Note

The full clone option described here refers to specifying whether CodePipeline should clone
repository metadata, which can only be used by CodeBuild commands. To use a GitHub [user access token](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/creating-github-apps/authenticating-with-a-github-app/generating-a-user-access-token-for-a-github-app "https://docs.github.com/en/apps/creating-github-apps/authenticating-with-a-github-app/generating-a-user-access-token-for-a-github-app") for use with CodeBuild projects, follow the steps here to install
the AWS Connector for GitHub app and then leave the App installation field empty. CodeConnections will
use the user access token for the connection.

###### Important

As part of creating a pipeline, an S3 artifact bucket provided by the customer will be
used by CodePipeline for artifacts. (This is different from the bucket used for an S3 source action.)
If the S3 artifact bucket is in a different account from the account for your pipeline, make
sure that the S3 artifact bucket is owned by AWS accounts that are safe and will be
dependable.

In this tutorial, you will create a pipeline that connects to your GitHub repository, uses
the full clone option for source data, and run a CodeBuild build that clones your repository and
performs Git commands for the repository.

###### Note

This feature is not available in the Asia Pacific (Hong Kong),
Africa (Cape Town), Middle East (Bahrain), Europe (Zurich), or AWS GovCloud (US-West)
Regions. To reference other available actions, see [Product and service integrations with CodePipeline](integrations.md "integrations.md"). For considerations with this action in the
Europe (Milan) Region, see the note in [CodeStarSourceConnection for
Bitbucket Cloud, GitHub, GitHub Enterprise Server, GitLab.com, and GitLab self-managed
actions](action-reference-CodestarConnectionSource.md "action-reference-CodestarConnectionSource.md").

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, you must do the following:

- Create a GitHub repository with your GitHub account.
- Have your GitHub credentials ready. When you use the AWS Management Console to set up a connection,
  you are asked to sign in with your GitHub credentials.

## Step 1: Create a README file

After you create your GitHub repository, use these steps to add a README file.

1. Log in to your GitHub repository and choose your repository.
2. To create a new file, choose **Add file > Create new file**. Name the
   file `README.md`. file and add the following text.

```
This is a GitHub repository!
```

3. Choose **Commit changes**.

Make sure the `README.md` file is at the root level of your
repository.

## Step 2: Create your pipeline and build

project

In this section, you create a pipeline with the following actions:

- A source stage with a connection to your GitHub repository and action.
- A build stage with an AWS CodeBuild build action.

###### To create a pipeline with the wizard

1. Sign in to the CodePipeline console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/ "https://console.aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/").
2. On the **Welcome** page, **Getting started** page,
   or **Pipelines** page, choose **Create
   pipeline**.
3. On the **Step 1: Choose creation option** page, under
   **Creation options**, choose the **Build custom
   pipeline** option. Choose **Next**.
4. In **Step 2: Choose pipeline settings**, in **Pipeline
   name**, enter `MyGitHubPipeline`.
5. In **Pipeline type**, choose **V1** for the purposes
   of this tutorial. You can also choose **V2**; however, note that pipeline
   types differ in characteristics and price. For more information, see [Pipeline types](pipeline-types.md "pipeline-types.md").
6. In **Service role**, choose **New service
   role**.

###### Note

If you choose instead to use your existing CodePipeline service role, make sure that you
have added the `codestar-connections:UseConnection` IAM permission to your
service role policy. For instructions for the CodePipeline service role, see [Add permissions
to the the CodePipeline service role](security-iam.md#how-to-update-role-new-services "security-iam.md#how-to-update-role-new-services"). 7. Under **Advanced settings**, leave the defaults. In
**Artifact store**, choose **Default location** to use
the default artifact store, such as the Amazon S3 artifact bucket designated as the default,
for your pipeline in the Region you selected for your pipeline.

###### Note

This is not the source bucket for your source code. This is the artifact store for
your pipeline. A separate artifact store, such as an S3 bucket, is required for each
pipeline.

Choose **Next**. 8. On the **Step 3: Add source stage** page, add a source stage:

    1. In **Source provider**, choose **GitHub (via GitHub
     App)**.
    2. Under **Connection**, choose an existing connection or create a
     new one. To create or manage a connection for your GitHub source action, see [GitHub connections](connections-github.md "connections-github.md").


    You install one app for all of your connections to a particular provider. If you
     have already installed the AWS Connector for GitHub app, choose it and skip this
     step.


    ###### Note

    If you want to create a  [user access token](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/creating-github-apps/authenticating-with-a-github-app/generating-a-user-access-token-for-a-github-app "https://docs.github.com/en/apps/creating-github-apps/authenticating-with-a-github-app/generating-a-user-access-token-for-a-github-app"), make sure that you've already installed the AWS
     Connector for GitHub app and then leave the App installation field empty. CodeConnections will
     use the user access token for the connection. For more information, see [Access your source provider in CodeBuild](../../../codebuild/latest/userguide/access-tokens.md "../../../codebuild/latest/userguide/access-tokens.md").
    3. In **Repository name**, choose the name of your GitHub
     repository.
    4. In **Branch name**, choose the repository branch you
     want to use.
    5. Make sure the **Start the pipeline on source code change** option
     is selected.
    6. Under **Output artifact format**, choose **Full
     clone** to enable the Git clone option for the source repository. Only
     actions provided by CodeBuild can use the Git clone option. You will use [Step 3: Update the CodeBuild service role
     policy to use connections](#tutorials-github-gitclone-rolepolicy "#tutorials-github-gitclone-rolepolicy") in this tutorial to update
     the permissions for your CodeBuild project service role to use this option.Choose **Next**.

9. In **Step 4: Add build stage**, add a build stage:
   1. In **Build provider**, choose **AWS CodeBuild**.
      Allow **Region** to default to the pipeline Region.
   2. Choose **Create project**.
   3. In **Project name**, enter a name for this build project.
   4. In **Environment image**, choose **Managed
      image**. For **Operating system**, choose
      **Ubuntu**.
   5. For **Runtime**, choose **Standard**. For
      **Image**, choose
      **aws/codebuild/standard:5.0**.
   6. For **Service role**, choose **New service
      role**.

   ###### Note

   Note the name of your CodeBuild service role. You will need the role name for the
   final step in this tutorial. 7. Under **Buildspec**, for **Build
   specifications**, choose **Insert build commands**. Choose
   **Switch to editor**, and paste the following under **Build
   commands**.

   ###### Note

   In the `env` section of the build spec, make sure the credential
   helper for git commands is enabled as shown in this example.

   ```
   version: 0.2

   env:
     git-credential-helper: yes
   phases:
     install:
       #If you use the Ubuntu standard image 2.0 or later, you must specify runtime-versions.
       #If you specify runtime-versions and use an image other than Ubuntu standard image 2.0, the build fails.
       runtime-versions:
         nodejs: 12
         # name: version
       #commands:
         # - command
         # - command
     pre_build:
       commands:
         - ls -lt
         - cat README.md
     build:
       commands:
         - git log | head -100
         - git status
         - ls
         - git archive --format=zip HEAD > application.zip
     #post_build:
       #commands:
         # - command
         # - command
   artifacts:
     files:
       - application.zip
       # - location
     #name: $(date +%Y-%m-%d)
     #discard-paths: yes
     #base-directory: location
   #cache:
     #paths:
       # - paths
   ```

   8. Choose **Continue to CodePipeline**. This returns to the CodePipeline
      console and creates a CodeBuild project that uses your build commands for configuration.
      The build project uses a service role to manage AWS service permissions. This step
      might take a couple of minutes.
   9. Choose **Next**.

10. In **Step 5: Add test stage**, choose **Skip test
    stage**, and then accept the warning message by choosing
    **Skip** again.

Choose **Next**. 11. On the **Step 6: Add deploy stage** page, choose **Skip
deploy stage**, and then accept the warning message by choosing
**Skip** again. Choose **Next**. 12. On **Step 7: Review**, choose **Create
pipeline**.

## Step 3: Update the CodeBuild service role

policy to use connections

The initial pipeline run will fail because the CodeBuild service role must be updated with
permissions to use connections. Add the `codestar-connections:UseConnection` IAM
permission to your service role policy. For instructions to update the policy in the IAM
console, see [Add CodeBuild GitClone permissions for connections to
Bitbucket, GitHub, GitHub Enterprise Server, or GitLab.com](troubleshooting.md#codebuild-role-connections "troubleshooting.md#codebuild-role-connections").

## Step 4: View repository commands in build

output

1. When your service role is successfully updated, choose **Retry** on
   the failed CodeBuild stage.
2. After the pipeline runs successfully, on your successful build stage, choose
   **View details**.

On the details page, choose the **Logs** tab. View the CodeBuild build
output. The commands output the value of the entered variable.

The commands output the `README.md` file contents, list the files
in the directory, clone the repository, view the log, and archive the repository as a ZIP
file.
