# CodeBuild rule

When you create a condition, you can add the CodeBuild rule. This section provides a reference
for the rule parameters. For more information about rules and conditions, see [How do stage conditions work?](concepts-how-it-works-conditions.md "concepts-how-it-works-conditions.md").

You can use the CodeBuild rule to create a condition where the succesful run of your build
project meets the rule criteria, such as the build run being successful for a beforeEntry
condition.

###### Note

For beforeEntry conditions that are configured with the **Skip** result, only the following rules are available:
`LambdaInvoke` and `VariableCheck`.

## Service role policy permissions

For permissions for this rule, add the following to your CodePipeline service role
policy statement. Scope down permissions to the resource level.

```
{
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Action": [
        "codebuild:BatchGetBuilds",
        "codebuild:StartBuild"
    ],
    "Resource": "`resource_ARN`"
},
```

## Rule type

- Category: `Rule`
- Owner: `AWS`
- Provider: `CodeBuild`
- Version: `1`

## Configuration parameters

**ProjectName**

Required: Yes

`ProjectName` is the name of the build project in CodeBuild.

**PrimarySource**

Required: Conditional

The value of the `PrimarySource` parameter must be the name of
one of the input artifacts to the action. CodeBuild looks for the buildspec file
and runs the buildspec commands in the directory that contains the unzipped
version of this artifact.

This parameter is required if multiple input artifacts are specified for a
CodeBuild action. When there is only one source artifact for the action, the
`PrimarySource` artifact defaults to that artifact.

**BatchEnabled**

Required: No

The Boolean value of the `BatchEnabled` parameter allows the
action to run multiple builds in the same build execution.

When this option is enabled, the `CombineArtifacts` option is
available.

For pipeline examples with batch builds enabled, see [CodePipeline integration with
CodeBuild and batch builds](../../../codebuild/latest/userguide/sample-pipeline-batch.md "../../../codebuild/latest/userguide/sample-pipeline-batch.md").

**CombineArtifacts**

Required: No

The Boolean value of the `CombineArtifacts` parameter combines
all build artifacts from a batch build into a single artifact file for the
build action.

To use this option, the `BatchEnabled` parameter must be
enabled.

**EnvironmentVariables**

Required: No

The value of this parameter is used to set environment variables for the
CodeBuild action in your pipeline. The value for the
`EnvironmentVariables` parameter takes the form of a JSON
array of environment variable objects. See the example parameter in [Action declaration (CodeBuild
example)](action-reference-CodeBuild.md#action-reference-CodeBuild-example "action-reference-CodeBuild.md#action-reference-CodeBuild-example").

Each object has three parts, all of which are strings:

- `name`: The name or key of the environment variable.
- `value`: The value of the environment variable. When
  using the `PARAMETER_STORE` or
  `SECRETS_MANAGER` type, this value must be the name
  of a parameter you have already stored in AWS Systems Manager
  Parameter Store or a secret you have already stored in AWS
  Secrets Manager, respectively.

###### Note

We strongly discourage the use of environment variables to
store sensitive values, especially AWS credentials. When you
use the CodeBuild console or AWS CLI, environment variables are
displayed in plain text. For sensitive values, we recommend that
you use the `SECRETS_MANAGER` type instead.

- `type`: (Optional) The type of environment variable.
  Valid values are `PARAMETER_STORE`,
  `SECRETS_MANAGER`, or `PLAINTEXT`. When
  not specified, this defaults to `PLAINTEXT`.

###### Note

When you enter the `name`, `value`, and
`type` for your environment variables configuration,
especially if the environment variable contains CodePipeline output variable
syntax, do not exceed the 1000-character limit for the configuration’s
value field. A validation error is returned when this limit is
exceeded.

For more information, see [EnvironmentVariable](../../../codebuild/latest/APIReference/API_EnvironmentVariable.md "../../../codebuild/latest/APIReference/API_EnvironmentVariable.md") in the AWS CodeBuild API Reference. For an
example CodeBuild action with an environment variable that resolves to the
GitHub branch name, see [Example: Use a BranchName
variable with CodeBuild environment variables](actions-variables.md#actions-variables-examples-env-branchname "actions-variables.md#actions-variables-examples-env-branchname").

  EnvironmentVariables: '[{"name":"VAR1","value":"variable","type":"PLAINTEXT"}]'
inputArtifacts:
- name: SourceArtifact
region: us-east-1
```

JSON

```

    "name": "codebuild-rule",
    "ruleTypeId": {
        "category": "Rule",
        "owner": "AWS",

        "version": "1"
    },
    "configuration": {

            "name": "SourceArtifact",
            "EnvironmentVariables": "[{\"name\":\"VAR1\",\"value\":\"variable\",\"type\":\"PLAINTEXT\"}]"
        }
    ],
