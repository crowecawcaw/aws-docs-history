# Amazon Elastic Container Service deploy action reference

You can use an Amazon ECS action to deploy an Amazon ECS service and task set. An Amazon ECS service is a
container application that is deployed to an Amazon ECS cluster. An Amazon ECS cluster is a collection
of instances that host your container application in the cloud. The deployment requires a
task definition that you create in Amazon ECS and an image definitions file that CodePipeline uses to
deploy the image.

###### Important

The Amazon ECS standard deployment action for CodePipeline creates its own revision of the task
definition based on the the revision used by the Amazon ECS service. If you create new
revisions for the task definition without updating the Amazon ECS service, the deployment
action will ignore those revisions.

Before you create your pipeline, you must have already created the Amazon ECS resources, tagged
and stored the image in your image repository, and uploaded the BuildSpec file to your file
repository.

## Action type

- Category: `Deploy`
- Owner: `AWS`
- Provider: `ECS`
- Version: `1`

## Configuration parameters

**ClusterName**

Required: Yes

The Amazon ECS cluster in Amazon ECS.

**ServiceName**

Required: Yes

The Amazon ECS service that you created in Amazon ECS.

**FileName**

Required: No

The name of your image definitions file, the JSON file that describes your
service's container name and the image and tag. You use this file for ECS
standard deployments. For more information, see [Input artifacts](#action-reference-ECS-input "#action-reference-ECS-input") and [imagedefinitions.json file for Amazon ECS
standard deployment actions](file-reference.md#pipelines-create-image-definitions "file-reference.md#pipelines-create-image-definitions").

**DeploymentTimeout**

Required: No

The Amazon ECS deployment action timeout in minutes. The timeout is
configurable up to the maximum default timeout for this action. For example:

```
"DeploymentTimeout": "15"
```

## Input artifacts

- **Number of artifacts:**
  `1`
- **Description:** The action looks for an
  `imagedefinitions.json` file in the source file
  repository for the pipeline. An image definitions document is a JSON file that
  describes your Amazon ECS container name and the image and tag. CodePipeline uses the file
  to retrieve the image from your image repository such as Amazon ECR. You can manually
  add an `imagedefinitions.json` file for a pipeline where the
  action is not automated. For information about the
  `imagedefinitions.json` file, see [imagedefinitions.json file for Amazon ECS
  standard deployment actions](file-reference.md#pipelines-create-image-definitions "file-reference.md#pipelines-create-image-definitions").

The action requires an existing image that has already been pushed to your
image repository. Because the image mapping is provided by the
`imagedefinitions.json` file, the action does not require
that the Amazon ECR source be included as a source action in the pipeline.

## Output artifacts

- **Number of artifacts:**
  `0`
- **Description:** Output artifacts do not apply
  for this action type.

## Service role permissions: Amazon ECS standard action

For Amazon ECS, the following are the minimum permissions needed to create pipelines with
an Amazon ECS deploy action.

JSON

```
`{
 "Version":"2012-10-17",
 "Statement": [
 {
 "Sid": "TaskDefinitionPermissions",
 "Effect": "Allow",
 "Action": [
 "ecs:DescribeTaskDefinition",
 "ecs:RegisterTaskDefinition"
 ],
 "Resource": [
 "*"
 ]
 },
 {
 "Sid": "ECSServicePermissions",
 "Effect": "Allow",
 "Action": [
 "ecs:DescribeServices",
 "ecs:UpdateService"
 ],
 "Resource": [
 "arn:aws:ecs:*:`111122223333`:service/[[clusters]]/*"
 ]
 },
 {
 "Sid": "ECSTagResource",
 "Effect": "Allow",
 "Action": [
 "ecs:TagResource"
 ],
 "Resource": [
 "arn:aws:ecs:*:`111122223333`:task-definition/[[taskDefinitions]]:*"
 ],
 "Condition": {
 "StringEquals": {
 "ecs:CreateAction": [
 "RegisterTaskDefinition"
 ]
 }
 }
 },
 {
 "Sid": "IamPassRolePermissions",
 "Effect": "Allow",
 "Action": "iam:PassRole",
 "Resource": [
 "arn:aws:iam::`111122223333`:role/[[passRoles]]"
 ],
 "Condition": {
 "StringEquals": {
 "iam:PassedToService": [
 "ecs.amazonaws.com",
 "ecs-tasks.amazonaws.com"
 ]
 }
 }
 }
 ]
}`

```

You can opt in to using tagging authorization in Amazon ECS. By opting in, you must grant
the following permissions: `ecs:TagResource`. For more information about how
to opt in and to determine whether the permission is required and tag authorization is
enforced, see [Tagging authorization timeline](../../../AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs-account-settings.md#tag-resources-timeline "../../../AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs-account-settings.md#tag-resources-timeline") in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide.

You must add the `iam:PassRole` permissions to use IAM roles for tasks. For
more information, see [Amazon ECS
task execution IAM role](../../../AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task_execution_IAM_role.md "../../../AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task_execution_IAM_role.md") and [IAM Roles for Tasks](../../../AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task-iam-roles.md "../../../AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task-iam-roles.md"). Use the following policy text.

  tutorial shows you how to incorporate a CodeBuild BuildSpec file that builds and
  pushes your Docker image to Amazon ECR and creates your imagedefinitions.json file.
  Finally, you create an Amazon ECS service and task definition, and then you create
  your pipeline with an Amazon ECS deployment action.
