<a name="action-reference-ECS"></a>

You can use an Amazon ECS action to deploy an Amazon ECS service and task set. An Amazon ECS service is a container application that is deployed to an Amazon ECS cluster. An Amazon ECS cluster is a collection of instances that host your container application in the cloud. The deployment requires a task definition that you create in Amazon ECS and an image definitions file that CodePipeline uses to deploy the image.

**Important**  
The Amazon ECS standard deployment action for CodePipeline creates its own revision of the task definition based on the revision used by the Amazon ECS service. If you create new revisions for the task definition without updating the Amazon ECS service, the deployment action will ignore those revisions.

Before you create your pipeline, you must have already created the Amazon ECS resources, tagged and stored the image in your image repository, and uploaded the buildspec file to your file repository.

**Note**  
This reference topic describes the Amazon ECS standard deployment action for CodePipeline. For reference information about Amazon ECS to CodeDeploy blue/green deployment actions in CodePipeline, see [Amazon Elastic Container Service and CodeDeploy blue-green deploy action reference](action-reference-ECSbluegreen.md).

## Action type
<a name="action-reference-ECS-type"></a>
+ Category: `Deploy`
+ Owner: `AWS`
+ Provider: `ECS`
+ Version: `1`

## Configuration parameters
<a name="action-reference-ECS-config"></a>

**ClusterName**  
Required: Yes  
The Amazon ECS cluster in Amazon ECS.

**ServiceName**  
Required: Yes  
The Amazon ECS service that you created in Amazon ECS.

**FileName**  
Required: No  
The name of your image definitions file, the JSON file that describes your service's container name and the image and tag. You use this file for ECS standard deployments. For more information, see [Input artifacts](#action-reference-ECS-input) and [imagedefinitions.json file for Amazon ECS standard deployment actions](file-reference.md#pipelines-create-image-definitions).

**DeploymentTimeout**  
Required: No  
The Amazon ECS deployment action timeout in minutes. The timeout is configurable up to the maximum default timeout for this action. For example:   

```
"DeploymentTimeout": "15"
```

## Input artifacts
<a name="action-reference-ECS-input"></a>
+ **Number of artifacts:** `1`
+ **Description:** The action looks for an `imagedefinitions.json` file in the source file repository for the pipeline. An image definitions document is a JSON file that describes your Amazon ECS container name and the image and tag. CodePipeline uses the file to retrieve the image from your image repository such as Amazon ECR. You can manually add an `imagedefinitions.json` file for a pipeline where the action is not automated. For information about the `imagedefinitions.json` file, see [imagedefinitions.json file for Amazon ECS standard deployment actions](file-reference.md#pipelines-create-image-definitions).

  The action requires an existing image that has already been pushed to your image repository. Because the image mapping is provided by the `imagedefinitions.json` file, the action does not require that the Amazon ECR source be included as a source action in the pipeline.

## Output artifacts
<a name="action-reference-ECS-output"></a>
+ **Number of artifacts:** `0` 
+ **Description:** Output artifacts do not apply for this action type.

You can opt in to using tagging authorization in Amazon ECS. By opting in, you must grant the following permissions: `ecs:TagResource`. For more information about how to opt in and to determine whether the permission is required and tag authorization is enforced, see [Tagging authorization timeline](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs-account-settings.html#tag-resources-timeline) in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide.

You must add the `iam:PassRole` permissions to use IAM roles for tasks. For more information, see [Amazon ECS task execution IAM role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task_execution_IAM_role.html) and [IAM Roles for Tasks](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task-iam-roles.html).
