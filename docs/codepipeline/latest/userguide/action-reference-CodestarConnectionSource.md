# CodeStarSourceConnection for

Bitbucket Cloud, GitHub, GitHub Enterprise Server, GitLab.com, and GitLab self-managed
actions

Source actions for connections are supported by AWS CodeConnections. CodeConnections allows you to create and
manage connections between AWS resources and third-party repositories such as GitHub.
Starts a pipeline when a new commit is made on a third-party source code repository. The
source action retrieves code changes when a pipeline is manually run or when a webhook event
is sent from the source provider.

You can configure actions in your pipeline to use a Git configuration that allows you to
start your pipeline with triggers. To configure the pipeline trigger configuration to filter
with triggers, see more details in [Add trigger with code push or pull request event
types](pipelines-filter.md "pipelines-filter.md").

###### Note

This feature is not available in the Asia Pacific (Hong Kong),
Asia Pacific (Hyderabad), Asia Pacific (Jakarta), Asia Pacific (Melbourne),
Asia Pacific (Osaka), Africa (Cape Town), Middle East (Bahrain),
Middle East (UAE), Europe (Spain), Europe (Zurich),
Israel (Tel Aviv), or AWS GovCloud (US-West) Regions. To reference other available
actions, see [Product and service integrations with CodePipeline](integrations.md "integrations.md"). For
considerations with this action in the Europe (Milan) Region, see the note in CodeStarSourceConnection for
Bitbucket Cloud, GitHub, GitHub Enterprise Server, GitLab.com, and GitLab self-managed
actions.

Connections can associate your AWS resources with the following third-party
repositories:

- Bitbucket Cloud (through the **Bitbucket** provider option in the
  CodePipeline console or the `Bitbucket` provider in the CLI)

###### Note

You can create connections to a Bitbucket Cloud repository. Installed
Bitbucket provider types, such as Bitbucket Server, are not supported.

- ###### Note

If you are using a Bitbucket workspace, you must have administrator access to
create the connection.

- GitHub and GitHub Enterprise Cloud (through the **GitHub (via GitHub
  App)** provider option in the CodePipeline console or the `GitHub`
  provider in the CLI)

###### Note

If your repository is in a GitHub organization, you must be the organization
owner to create the connection. If you are using a repository that is not in an
organization, you must be the repository owner.

- GitHub Enterprise Server (through the **GitHub Enterprise
  Server** provider option in the CodePipeline console or the `GitHub
Enterprise Server` provider in the CLI)
- GitLab.com (through the **GitLab** provider option in the CodePipeline
  console or the `GitLab` provider in the CLI)

###### Note

You can create connections to a repository where you have the **Owner** role in GitLab, and then the connection can be
used with the repository with resources such as CodePipeline. For repositories in
groups, you do not need to be the group owner.

- Self-managed installation for GitLab (Enterprise Edition or Community Edition)
  (through the **GitLab self-managed** provider option in the CodePipeline
  console or the `GitLabSelfManaged` provider in the CLI)

###### Note

Each connection supports all of the repositories you have with that provider. You only
need to create a new connection for each provider type.

Connections allow your pipeline to detect source changes through the third-party
provider's installation app. For example, webhooks are used to subscribe to GitHub event
types and can be installed on an organization, a repository, or a GitHub App. Your
connection installs a repository webhook on your GitHub App that subscribes to GitHub push
type events.

After a code change is detected, you have the following options for passing the code to
subsequent actions:

- Default: Like other existing CodePipeline source actions,
  `CodeStarSourceConnection` can output a ZIP file with a shallow copy
  of your commit.
- Full clone: `CodeStarSourceConnection` can also be configured to output
  a URL reference to the repo for subsequent actions.

Currently, the Git URL reference can only be used by downstream CodeBuild actions to
clone the repo and associated Git metadata. Attempting to pass a Git URL reference
to non-CodeBuild actions results in an error.
CodePipeline prompts you to add the AWS Connector installation app to your third-party account
when you create a connection. You must have already created your third-party provider
account and repository before you can connect through the
`CodeStarSourceConnection` action.

###### Note

To create or attach a policy to your role with the permissions required to use AWS CodeStar
connections, see [Connections permissions reference](../../../dtconsole/latest/userguide/security-iam.md#permissions-reference-connections "../../../dtconsole/latest/userguide/security-iam.md#permissions-reference-connections"). Depending on when your CodePipeline service
role was created, you might need to update its permissions to support AWS CodeStar connections.
For instructions, see [Add permissions to the CodePipeline
service role](how-to-custom-role.md#how-to-update-role-new-services "how-to-custom-role.md#how-to-update-role-new-services").

###### Note

To use connections in the Europe (Milan) AWS Region, you must:

1. Install a Region-specific app
2. Enable the Region
   This Region-specific app supports connections in the Europe (Milan) Region. It is
   published on the third-party provider site, and it is separate from the existing app
   supporting connections for other Regions. By installing this app, you authorize
   third-party providers to share your data with the service for this Region only, and you
   can revoke the permissions at any time by uninstalling the app.

The service will not process or store your data unless you enable the Region. By
enabling this Region, you grant our service permissions to process and store your
data.

Even if the Region is not enabled, third-party providers can still share your data
with our service if the Region-specific app remains installed, so make sure to uninstall
the app once you disable the Region. For more information, see [Enabling a Region](../../../general/latest/gr/rande-manage.md#rande-manage-enable "../../../general/latest/gr/rande-manage.md#rande-manage-enable").

## Action type

- Category: `Source`
- Owner: `AWS`
- Provider: `CodeStarSourceConnection`
- Version: `1`

## Configuration

parameters

\***\*ConnectionArn\*\***

Required: Yes

The connection ARN that is configured and authenticated for the source
provider.

\***\*FullRepositoryId\*\***

Required: Yes

The owner and name of the repository where source changes are to be
detected.

Example: `some-user/my-repo`

###### Important

You must maintain the correct case for the
**FullRepositoryId** value. For example, if your
user name is `some-user` and repo name is
`My-Repo`, the recommended value of
**FullRepositoryId** is
`some-user/My-Repo`.

\***\*BranchName\*\***

Required: Yes

The name of the branch where source changes are to be detected.

\***\*OutputArtifactFormat\*\***

Required: No

Specifies the output artifact format. Can be either
`CODEBUILD_CLONE_REF` or `CODE_ZIP`. If
unspecified, the default is `CODE_ZIP`.

###### Important

The `CODEBUILD_CLONE_REF` option can only be used by CodeBuild
downstream actions.

If you choose this option, you will need to update the permissions for
your CodeBuild project service role as shown in [Add CodeBuild GitClone permissions for connections to
Bitbucket, GitHub, GitHub Enterprise Server, or GitLab.com](troubleshooting.md#codebuild-role-connections "troubleshooting.md#codebuild-role-connections"). For a tutorial that
shows you how to use the **Full clone** option, see
[Tutorial: Use full clone with a GitHub pipeline
source](tutorials-github-gitclone.md "tutorials-github-gitclone.md").

**DetectChanges**

Required: No

Controls automatically starting your pipeline when a new commit is made on
the configured repository and branch. If unspecified, the default value is
`true`, and the field does not display by default. Valid
values for this parameter:

- `true`: CodePipeline automatically starts your pipeline on new
  commits.
- `false`: CodePipeline does not start your pipeline on new
  commits.

## Input

artifacts

- **Number of artifacts:**
  `0`
- **Description:** Input artifacts do not apply for
  this action type.

## Output

artifacts

- **Number of artifacts:**
  `1`
- **Description:** The artifacts generated from the
  repository are the output artifacts for the
  `CodeStarSourceConnection` action. The source code commit ID is
  displayed in CodePipeline as the source revision for the triggered pipeline execution.
  You can configure the output artifact of this action in:
  - A ZIP file that contains the contents of the configured repository and
    branch at the commit specified as the source revision for the pipeline
    execution.
  - A JSON file that contains a URL reference to the repository so that
    downstream actions can perform Git commands directly.

  ###### Important

  This option can only be used by CodeBuild downstream actions.

  If you choose this option, you will need to update the permissions
  for your CodeBuild project service role as shown in [Troubleshooting CodePipeline](troubleshooting.md "troubleshooting.md"). For
  a tutorial that shows you how to use the **Full
  clone** option, see [Tutorial: Use full clone with a GitHub pipeline
  source](tutorials-github-gitclone.md "tutorials-github-gitclone.md").

## Output variables

When configured, this action produces variables that can be referenced by the action
configuration of a downstream action in the pipeline. This action produces variables
which can be viewed as output variables, even if the action doesn't have a namespace.
You configure an action with a namespace to make those variables available to the
configuration of downstream actions.

For more information, see [Variables reference](reference-variables.md "reference-variables.md").

AuthorDate

The date when the commit was authored, in timestamp format.

BranchName

The name of the branch for the repository where the source change was
made.

CommitId

The commit ID that triggered the pipeline execution.

CommitMessage

The description message, if any, associated with the commit that triggered
the pipeline execution.

ConnectionArn

The connection ARN that is configured and authenticated for the source
provider.

FullRepositoryName

The name of the repository where the commit that triggered the pipeline
was made.

## Service role permissions: CodeConnections

action

For CodeConnections, the following permission is required to create pipelines with a source
that uses a connection, such as Bitbucket Cloud.

```
{
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Action": [
        "codeconnections:UseConnection"
    ],
    "Resource": "`resource_ARN`"
},
```

For more information about the IAM permissions for connections, see [Connections permissions reference](../../../dtconsole/latest/userguide/security-iam.md#permissions-reference-connections "../../../dtconsole/latest/userguide/security-iam.md#permissions-reference-connections").

        }
    ]
},
```

## Installing the

installation app and creating a connection

The first time you use the console to add a new connection to a third-party
repository, you must authorize CodePipeline access to your repositories. You choose or create
an installation app that helps you connect to the account where you have created your
third-party code repository.

When you use the AWS CLI or an AWS CloudFormation template, you must provide the connection ARN of a
connection that has already gone through the installation handshake. Otherwise, the
pipeline is not triggered.

###### Note

For a `CodeStarSourceConnection` source action, you do not have to set
up a webhook or default to polling. The connections action manages your source
change detection for you.
