# Action declaration

The action level of a pipeline has a basic structure that includes the following
parameters and syntax. For more information, see the [ActionDeclaration](../APIReference/API_ActionDeclaration.md "../APIReference/API_ActionDeclaration.md") object in the _CodePipeline API
Guide_.

The following example shows the action level of the pipeline structure in both
JSON and YAML.

```

For a list of example `configuration` details appropriate to the provider
type, see [Valid configuration parameters for
each provider type](structure-configuration-examples.md "structure-configuration-examples.md").

The action structure has the following requirements:

- All action names within a stage must be unique.
- A source action is required for each pipeline.
- Source actions that do not use a connection can be configured for change
  detection or to turn off change detection. See [Change Detection Methods](change-detection-methods.md "change-detection-methods.md").
- This is true for all actions, whether they are in the same stage or in
  following stages, but the input artifact does not have to be the next action in
  strict sequence from the action that provided the output artifact. Actions in
  parallel can declare different output artifact bundles, which are, in turn,
  consumed by different following actions.
- When you use an Amazon S3 bucket as a deployment location, you also specify an
  object key. An object key can be a file name (object) or a combination of a
  prefix (folder path) and file name. You can use variables to specify the
  location name you want the pipeline to use. Amazon S3 deployment actions support the
  use of the following variables in Amazon S3 object keys.

| Using variables in Amazon S3 | Variable                      | Example of console input                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Output |

## `name`

The name of the action.

## `region`

For actions where the provider is an AWS service, the AWS Region of the
resource.

Cross-Region actions use the `Region` field to designate the
AWS Region where the actions are to be created. The AWS resources created for
this action must be created in the same Region provided in the `region`
field. You cannot create cross-Region actions for the following action types:

- Source actions
- Actions by third-party providers
- Actions by custom providers

## `roleArn`

The ARN of the IAM service role that performs the declared action. This is assumed
through the roleArn that is specified at the pipeline level.

## `namespace`

Actions can be configured with variables. You use the `namespace` field
to set the namespace and variable information for execution variables. For reference
information about execution variables and action output variables, see [Variables reference](reference-variables.md "reference-variables.md").

###### Note

For Amazon ECR, Amazon S3, or CodeCommit sources, you can also create a source override using
input transform entry to use the `revisionValue` in EventBridge for your
pipeline event, where the `revisionValue` is derived from the source
event variable for your object key, commit, or image ID. For more information,
see the optional step for input transform entry included in the procedures under
[Amazon ECR source actions and EventBridge resources](create-cwe-ecr-source.md "create-cwe-ecr-source.md"), [Connecting to Amazon S3 source actions with a
source enabled for events](create-S3-source-events.md "create-S3-source-events.md"), or [CodeCommit source actions and EventBridge](triggering.md "triggering.md").

## `actionTypeId`

The action type ID is identified as a combination of the following four
fields.

### `category`

The type of action, or step, in the pipeline, such as a source action. Each
action type has a specific set of valid action providers. For a list of valid
providers by action type, see the [Action structure reference](action-reference.md "action-reference.md").

These are the valid `actionTypeId` categories (action types) for
CodePipeline:

- `Source`
- `Build`
- `Approval`
- `Deploy`
- `Test`
- `Invoke`
- `Compute`

### `owner`

For all currently supported action types, the only valid owner string is
`AWS`, `ThirdParty`, or `Custom`. For the
valid owner string for a specific action, see the [Action structure reference](action-reference.md "action-reference.md").

For more information, see the [CodePipeline API
Reference](../APIReference.md "../APIReference.md").

### `version`

The version of the action.

### `provider`

The action provider, such as CodeBuild.

- Valid provider types for an action category depend on the category.
  For example, for a source action category, a valid provider type is
  `S3`, `CodeStarSourceConnection`,
  `CodeCommit`, or `Amazon ECR`. This example
  shows the structure for a source action with an `S3`
  provider:

```
"actionTypeId": {
  "category": "Source",
  "owner": "AWS",
  "version": "1",
  "provider": "S3"},
```

## `InputArtifacts`

This field is contains the input artifact structure, if supported for the action
category. The input artifact of an action must exactly match the output artifact
declared in a preceding action. For example, if a preceding action includes the
following declaration:

```
"outputArtifacts": [
    {
    "MyApp"
    }
],
```

and there are no other output artifacts, then the input artifact of a following
action must be:

```
"inputArtifacts": [
    {
    "MyApp"
    }
],
```

For example, a source action cannot have input artifacts because it is the first
action in the pipeline. However, a source action will always have output artifacts
that are processed by the following action. The output artifacts for a source action
are the application files from the source repository, zipped and provided through
the artifact bucket, that are processed by the following action, such as a CodeBuild
action that acts on the application files with build commands.

As an example of actions that cannot have output artifacts, deploy actions do not
have output artifacts because these actions are generally the last action in a
pipeline.

### `name`

The artifact name for the action's input artifacts.

## `outputArtifacts`

Output artifact names must be unique in a pipeline. For example, a pipeline can
include one action that has an output artifact named `"MyApp"` and
another action that has an output artifact named `"MyBuiltApp"`. However,
a pipeline cannot include two actions that both have an output artifact named
`"MyApp"`.

This field is contains the
output artifact structure, if supported for the action category. The output artifact
of an action must exactly match the output artifact declared in a preceding action.
For example, if a preceding action includes the following declaration:

```
"outputArtifacts": [
    {
    "MyApp"
    }
],
```

and there are no other output artifacts, then the input artifact of a following
action must be:

```
"inputArtifacts": [
    {
    "MyApp"
    }
],
```

For example, a source action cannot have input artifacts because it is the first
action in the pipeline. However, a source action will always have output artifacts
that are processed by the following action. The output artifacts for a source action
are the application files from the source repository, zipped and provided through
the artifact bucket, that are processed by the following action, such as a CodeBuild
action that acts on the application files with build commands.

As an example of actions that cannot have output artifacts, deploy actions do not
have output artifacts because these actions are generally the last action in a
pipeline.

### `name`

The artifact name for the action's output artifacts.

## `configuration` (by action

provider)

The action configuration contains details and parameters appropriate to the
provider type. In the section below, the example action configuration parameters are
specific to the S3 source action.

The action configuration and input/output artifact limits can vary by action
provider. For a list of action configuration examples by action provider, see [Action structure reference](action-reference.md "action-reference.md") and the table in
[Valid configuration parameters for
each provider type](structure-configuration-examples.md "structure-configuration-examples.md"). The table provides a link to
the action reference for each provider type, which lists the configuration
parameters for each action in detail. For a table with the input and output artifact
limits for each action provider, see [Valid input and output artifacts for each
action type](reference-action-artifacts.md "reference-action-artifacts.md").

The following considerations apply to working with actions:

- Source actions do not have input artifacts, and deploy actions do not have
  output artifacts.
- For source action providers that do not use a connection, such as S3, you
  must use the `PollForSourceChanges` parameter to specify whether
  you want your pipeline to start automatically when a change is detected. See
  [Valid settings for the
  PollForSourceChanges parameter](PollForSourceChanges-defaults.md "PollForSourceChanges-defaults.md").
- To configure automated change detection to start your pipeline, or to
  disable change detection, see [Source actions and change detection
  methods](change-detection-methods.md "change-detection-methods.md").
- To configure triggers with filtering, use the source action for
  connections, and then see [Automate starting pipelines using triggers and
  filtering](pipelines-triggers.md "pipelines-triggers.md").
- For the output variables for each action, see [Variables reference](reference-variables.md "reference-variables.md").

###### Note

For Amazon ECR, Amazon S3, or CodeCommit sources, you can also create a source
override using input transform entry to use the
`revisionValue` in EventBridge for your pipeline event, where
the `revisionValue` is derived from the source event variable
for your object key, commit, or image ID. For more information, see the
optional step for input transform entry included in the procedures under
[Amazon ECR source actions and EventBridge resources](create-cwe-ecr-source.md "create-cwe-ecr-source.md"), [Connecting to Amazon S3 source actions with a
source enabled for events](create-S3-source-events.md "create-S3-source-events.md"), or [CodeCommit source actions and EventBridge](triggering.md "triggering.md").

###### Important

Pipelines that are inactive for longer than 30 days will have polling disabled for the pipeline.
For more information, see [pollingDisabledAt](pipeline-requirements.md#metadata.pollingDisabledAt "pipeline-requirements.md#metadata.pollingDisabledAt") in the pipeline structure reference.
For the steps to migrate your pipeline from polling to event-based change detection, see
[Change Detection Methods](change-detection-methods.md "change-detection-methods.md").

###### Note

The CodeCommit and S3 source actions require either a configured change detection resource (an EventBridge rule) or use the option to poll the repository for source changes. For pipelines with a Bitbucket, GitHub, or GitHub Enterprise Server source action, you do not have to set up a webhook or default to polling. The connections action manages change detection for you.

## `runOrder`

A positive integer that indicates the run order of the action within the stage.
Parallel actions in the stage are shown as having the same integer. For example, two
actions with a run order of two will run in parallel after the first action in the
stage runs.

The default `runOrder` value for an action is 1. The value must be a
positive integer (natural number). You cannot use fractions, decimals, negative
numbers, or zero. To specify a serial sequence of actions, use the smallest number
for the first action and larger numbers for each of the rest of the actions in
sequence. To specify parallel actions, use the same integer for each action you want
to run in parallel. In the console, you can specify a serial sequence for an action
by choosing **Add action group** at the level in the
stage where you want it to run, or you can specify a parallel sequence by choosing
**Add action**. _Action
group_ refers to a run order of one or more actions at the same
level.

For example, if you want three actions to run in sequence in a stage, you would
give the first action the `runOrder` value of 1, the second action the
`runOrder` value of 2, and the third the `runOrder` value
of 3. However, if you want the second and third actions to run in parallel, you
would give the first action the `runOrder` value of 1 and both the second
and third actions the `runOrder` value of 2.

###### Note

The numbering of serial actions do not have to be in strict sequence. For
example, if you have three actions in a sequence and decide to remove the second
action, you do not need to renumber the `runOrder` value of the third
action. Because the `runOrder` value of that action (3) is higher
than the `runOrder` value of the first action (1), it runs serially
after the first action in the stage.
