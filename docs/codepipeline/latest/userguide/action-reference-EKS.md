# Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service `EKS` deploy action

reference

You can use the `EKSDeploy` action to deploy an Amazon EKS service. The deployment
requires a Kubernetes manifest file that CodePipeline uses to deploy the image.

Before you create your pipeline, you must have already created the Amazon EKS resources and
have stored the image in your image repository. Optionally, you can provide VPC information
for your cluster.

###### Important

This action uses CodePipeline managed CodeBuild compute to run commands in a build environment.
Running the commands action will incur separate charges in AWS CodeBuild.

###### Note

The `EKS` deploy action is only available for V2 type pipelines.

The EKS action supports both public and private EKS clusters. Private clusters are the
type recommended by EKS; however, both types are supported.

The EKS action is supported for cross-account actions. To add a cross-account EKS action,
add `actionRoleArn` from your target account in the action declaration.

## Action type

- Category: `Deploy`
- Owner: `AWS`
- Provider: `EKS`
- Version: `1`

## Configuration parameters

**ClusterName**

Required: Yes

The Amazon EKS cluster in Amazon EKS.

**Options under Helm**

The following are available options when **Helm** is the
selected deployment tool.

**HelmReleaseName**

Required: Yes (Required only for **Helm**
type)

The release name for your deployment.

**HelmChartLocation**

Required: Yes (Required only for **Helm**
type)

The chart location for your deployment.

**HelmValuesFiles**

Required: No (Optional only for **Helm**
type)

To override for helm values files, enter the comma-separated
helm values files in the helm chart location.

**Options under Kubectl**

The following are available options when **Kubectl** is
the selected deployment tool.

**ManifestFiles**

Required: Yes (Required only for **Kubectl**
type)

The name of your manifest file, the text file that describes
your service's container name and the image and tag. You use
this file to parameterize your image URI and other information.
You can use environment variable for this purpose.

You store this file in the source repository for your
pipeline.

**Namespace**

Required: No

The kubernetes namepsace to be used in `kubectl` or
`helm` commands.

**Subnets**

Required: No

The subnets for the VPC for your cluster. These are part of the same VPC
that is attached to your cluster. You can also provide subnets that aren't
already attached to your cluster and specify them here.

**SecurityGroupIds**

Required: No

The security groups for the VPC for your cluster. These are part of the
same VPC that is attached to your cluster. You can also provide security
groups that aren't already attached to your cluster and specify them
here.

## Input artifacts

- **Number of artifacts:**
  `1`
- **Description:** The action looks for the
  Kubernetes manifest file or Helm chart in the source file repository for the
  pipeline. If you want to use helm charts in .tgz format stored in an S3 bucket,
  you can do so by configuring the S3 Bucket/Key as your source action. For
  example, the object key provided would be
  `my-chart-0.1.0.tgz`.

## Output artifacts

- **Number of artifacts:**
  `0`
- **Description:** Output artifacts do not apply
  for this action type.

## Environment variables

Used to replace variables such as image repositories or image tags in manifest files
or helm chart values files.

**Key**

The key in a key-value environment variable pair, such as
`$IMAGE_TAG`.

**Value**

The value for the key-value pair, such as `v1.0`. The value can
be parameterized with output variables from pipeline actions or pipeline
variables. For example, pipeline can have an ECRBuildAndPublish action that
creates an ECR image with `${codepipeline.PipelineExecutionId}`,
and the EKS action can use this image using
`${codepipeline.PipelineExecutionId}` as the value of the
environment variable.

## Output variables

**EKSClusterName**

The Amazon EKS cluster in Amazon EKS.

## Service role policy

permissions

To run this action, the following permissions must be available in your pipeline's
service role policy.

- **EC2 actions:** When CodePipeline runs the action EC2
  instance permissions are required. Note that this is not the same as the EC2
  instance role required when you create your EKS cluster.

If you are using an existing service role, to use this action, you will need
to add the following permissions for the service role.

    + ec2:CreateNetworkInterface
    + ec2:DescribeDhcpOptions
    + ec2:DescribeNetworkInterfaces
    + ec2:DeleteNetworkInterface
    + ec2:DescribeSubnets
    + ec2:DescribeSecurityGroups
    + ec2:DescribeVpcs

- **EKS actions:** When CodePipeline runs the action, EKS
  cluster permissions are required. Note that this is not the same as the IAM EKS
  cluster role required when you create your EKS cluster.

If you are using an existing service role, to use this action, you will need
to add the following permission for the service role.

    + eks:DescribeCluster

- **Log stream actions:** When CodePipeline runs the
  action, CodePipeline creates a log group using the name of the pipeline as follows.
  This enables you to scope down permissions to log resources using the pipeline
  name.

```
/aws/codepipeline/`MyPipelineName`
```

If you are using an existing service role, to use this action, you will need
to add the following permissions for the service role.

    + logs:CreateLogGroup
    + logs:CreateLogStream
    + logs:PutLogEvents

In the service role policy statement, scope down the permissions to the resource level
as shown in the following example.

JSON

```
`{
 "Version":"2012-10-17",
 "Statement": [
 {
 "Effect": "Allow",
 "Action": [
 "eks:DescribeCluster"
 ],
 "Resource": "arn:aws:eks:*:`111122223333`:cluster/`YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME`"
 },
 {
 "Effect": "Allow",
 "Action": [
 "ec2:CreateNetworkInterface",
 "ec2:CreateNetworkInterfacePermission",
 "ec2:DescribeDhcpOptions",
 "ec2:DescribeNetworkInterfaces",
 "ec2:DeleteNetworkInterface",
 "ec2:DescribeSubnets",
 "ec2:DescribeSecurityGroups",
 "ec2:DescribeVpcs",
 "ec2:DescribeRouteTables"
 ],
 "Resource": "*"
 },
 {
 "Effect": "Allow",
 "Action": [
 "logs:CreateLogStream",
 "logs:CreateLogGroup",
 "logs:PutLogEvents"
 ],
 "Resource": [
 "arn:aws:logs:*:`111122223333`:log-group:/aws/codepipeline/`YOUR_PIPELINE_NAME`",
 "arn:aws:logs:*:`111122223333`:log-group:/aws/codepipeline/`YOUR_PIPELINE_NAME`:*"
 ]
 }
 ]
}`

```

To view logs in the console using the action details dialog page, the permission to
view logs must be added to the console role. For more information, see the console
permissions policy example in [Permissions required to view
compute logs in the CodePipeline console](security-iam-permissions-console-logs.md "security-iam-permissions-console-logs.md").

### Adding the service role

as an access entry for your cluster

After the permissions are available in your pipeline's service role policy, you
configure your cluster permissions by adding the CodePipeline service role as an
access entry for your cluster.

You can also use an action role that has the updated permissions. For more
information, see the tutorial example in [Step 4: Create an access entry for
the CodePipeline service role](tutorials-eks-deploy.md#tutorials-eks-deploy-access-entry "tutorials-eks-deploy.md#tutorials-eks-deploy-access-entry").
