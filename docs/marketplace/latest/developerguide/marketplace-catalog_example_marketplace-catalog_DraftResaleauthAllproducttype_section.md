# Create draft resale authorization for any product type using an AWS SDK
<a name="marketplace-catalog_example_marketplace-catalog_DraftResaleauthAllproducttype_section"></a>

The following code examples show how to create draft resale authorization for any product type so you can review them internally before publishing to a Channel Partner.

------
#### [ Java ]

**SDK for Java 2.x**  
 There's more on GitHub. Find the complete example and learn how to set up and run in the [AWS Marketplace API Reference Code Library](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-marketplace-reference-code/tree/main/java#catalog-api-reference-code) repository. 
To run this example, pass the following JSON changeset to `RunChangesets` in *Utilities to start a changeset* from the **Utilities** section.  

```
{
    "Catalog": "AWSMarketplace",
    "ChangeSet": [
        {
            "ChangeType": "CreateResaleAuthorization",
            "ChangeName": "ResaleAuthorization",
            "Entity": {
                "Type": "ResaleAuthorization@1.0"
            },
            "DetailsDocument": {
                "ProductId": "prod-1111111111111",
                "Name": "TestResaleAuthorization",
                "Description": "Worldwide ResaleAuthorization for Test Product",
                "ResellerAccountId": "111111111111"
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

#### [ Python ]

**SDK for Python (Boto3)**  
 There's more on GitHub. Find the complete example and learn how to set up and run in the [AWS Marketplace API Reference Code Library](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-marketplace-reference-code/blob/main/python##catalog-api-reference-code) repository. 

```
{
    "Catalog": "AWSMarketplace",
    "ChangeSet": [
        {
            "ChangeType": "CreateResaleAuthorization",

            }
        }
    ]
}
