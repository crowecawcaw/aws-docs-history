# Deleting a service-linked role for AWS Marketplace
<a name="buyer-delete-service-linked-role"></a>

If you no longer need to use a feature or service that requires a service-linked role, we recommend that you delete that role. That way you don’t have an unused entity that is not actively monitored or maintained. However, you must clean up the resources for your service-linked role before you can manually delete it.

**Note**  
If the AWS Marketplace service is using the role when you try to delete the resources, then the deletion might fail. If that happens, wait for a few minutes and try the operation again.

**To manually delete the service-linked role using IAM**

Use the IAM console, the AWS CLI, or the AWS API to delete the `AWSServiceRoleForMarketplaceLicenseManagement` service-linked role. For more information, see [Deleting a Service-Linked Role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/using-service-linked-roles.html#delete-service-linked-role) in the *IAM User Guide *.
