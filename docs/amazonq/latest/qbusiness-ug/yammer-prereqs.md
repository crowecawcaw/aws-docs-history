# Prerequisites for connecting Amazon Q to Microsoft Yammer

Before you begin, make sure that you have completed the following
prerequisites.

**In Microsoft Yammer, make sure you
have:**

- Created a Microsoft Yammer administrative account with verified admin
  user permissions.
- Configured an OAuth 2.0 credential token containing a client ID and client
  secret.
  **In your AWS account, make sure you have:**

- Created a Amazon Q Business application.
- Created a [Amazon Q Business retriever and added an index](select-retriever.md "select-retriever.md").
- Created an [IAM role](iam-roles.md#iam-roles-ds "iam-roles.md#iam-roles-ds") for your data source and, if using the Amazon Q API, noted the ARN of the IAM role.
- Stored your Microsoft Yammer authentication credentials in an AWS Secrets Manager
  secret and, if using the Amazon Q API, noted the ARN of the
  secret.

###### Note

If you’re a console user, you can create the IAM role and Secrets Manager
secret as part of configuring your Amazon Q application on the
console.
