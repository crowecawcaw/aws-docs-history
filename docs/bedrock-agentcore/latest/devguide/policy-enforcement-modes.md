# Policy enforcement modes

Enforcement mode defines how the gateway applies policy decisions. The policy engine supports two modes:

- In `LOG_ONLY` mode, the policy engine evaluates and logs whether the action would be allowed or denied without enforcing the the decision
- In `ENFORCE` mode, the policy engine evaluates the action and enforces decisions by allowing or denying agent operations.

## Restrict permission to change enforcement mode

If you have the `bedrock-agentcore:UpdateGateway` permission, you can change a Gateway’s
`policyEngineConfiguration.mode` from `ENFORCE` to `LOG_ONLY`. In `LOG_ONLY` mode, all policies are
evaluated but not enforced, and every tool call succeeds regardless of forbid policies. The same
permission can set `policyEngineConfiguration` to `null`, which removes the policy engine entirely. No
separate action or condition key protects the `mode` field beyond `bedrock-agentcore:UpdateGateway`,
so grant this permission only to trusted principals.
