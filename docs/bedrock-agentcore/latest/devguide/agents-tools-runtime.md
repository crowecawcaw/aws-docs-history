# Host agent or tools with Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Runtime

Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Runtime provides a secure, serverless and purpose-built hosting environment
for deploying and running AI agents or tools. It offers the following benefits:

Framework agnostic

AgentCore Runtime lets you transform any local agent code to cloud-native
deployments with a few lines of code no matter the underlying framework.
Works seamlessly with popular frameworks like LangGraph, Strands, and
CrewAI. You can also leverage it with custom agents that don't use a
specific framework.

Model flexibility

AgentCore Runtime works with any Large Language Model, such as models offered by
Amazon Bedrock, Anthropic Claude, Google Gemini, and OpenAI.

Protocol support

AgentCore Runtime lets agents communicate with other agents and tools via Model
Context Protocol (MCP) or Agent to Agent (A2A).

Session isolation

In AgentCore Runtime, each user session runs in a dedicated microVM with isolated
CPU, memory, and filesystem resources. This helps create complete separation
between user sessions, safeguarding stateful agent reasoning processes and
helps prevent cross-session data contamination. After session completion,
the entire microVM is terminated and memory is sanitized, delivering
deterministic security even when working with non-deterministic AI
processes.

Extended execution time

AgentCore Runtime supports both real-time interactions and long-running workloads up
to 8 hours, enabling complex agent reasoning and asynchronous workloads that
may involve multi-agent collaboration or extended problem-solving
sessions.

Consumption-based pricing model

Runtime implements consumption-based pricing that charges only for
resources actually consumed. Unlike allocation-based models that require
pre-selecting resources, Runtime dynamically provisions what's needed
without requiring right-sizing. The service aligns CPU billing with actual
active processing - typically eliminating charges during I/O wait periods
when agents are primarily waiting for LLM responses - while continuously
maintaining your session state.

Built-in authentication

AgentCore Runtime, powered by AgentCore Identity, assigns distinct
identities to AI agents and seamlessly integrates with your corporate
identity provider such as Okta, Microsoft Entra ID, or Amazon Cognito,
enabling your end users to authenticate into only the agents they have
access to. In addition, Runtime lets outbound authentication flows to
securely access third-party services like Slack, Zoom, and GitHub - whether
operating on behalf of users or autonomously (using either OAuth or API
keys).

Agent-specific observability

AgentCore Runtime provides specialized built-in tracing that captures agent
reasoning steps, tool invocations, and model interactions, providing clear
visibility into agent decision-making processes, a critical capability for
debugging and auditing AI agent behaviors.

Enhanced payload handling

AgentCore Runtime can process 100MB payloads enabling seamless processing of
multiple modalities (text, images, audio, video), with rich media content or
large datasets.

Bidirectional streaming

AgentCore Runtime supports both HTTP API calls and persistent WebSocket connections
for real-time bidirectional streaming, enabling interactive applications with
immediate response feedback and maintained conversation context.

Unified set of agent-specific capabilities

AgentCore Runtime is delivered through a single, comprehensive SDK that provides
streamlined access to the complete AgentCore capabilities including
Memory, Tools, and Gateway. This integrated approach eliminates the
integration work typically required when building equivalent agent
infrastructure from disparate components.
