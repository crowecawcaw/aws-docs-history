# Resource-based

policies within Wickr

**Supports resource-based policies:**

No

Resource-based policies are JSON policy documents that you attach to a resource. Examples of resource-based policies are
IAM _role trust policies_ and Amazon S3 _bucket policies_. In services that support resource-based policies, service
administrators can use them to control access to a specific resource. For the resource where the policy is attached, the policy defines what actions
a specified principal can perform on that resource and under what conditions. You must [specify a principal](../../../IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_elements_principal.md "../../../IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_elements_principal.md") in a resource-based policy. Principals
can include accounts, users, roles, federated users, or AWS services.

To enable cross-account access, you can specify an entire account or IAM entities
in another account as the principal in a resource-based policy. For more information, see [Cross account resource access in IAM](../../../IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies-cross-account-resource-access.md "../../../IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies-cross-account-resource-access.md") in the
_IAM User Guide_.
