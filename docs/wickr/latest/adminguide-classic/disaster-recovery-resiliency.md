# Resilience in AWS Wickr

The AWS global infrastructure is built around AWS Regions and Availability Zones.
AWS Regions provide multiple physically separated and isolated Availability Zones, which
are connected with low-latency, high-throughput, and highly redundant networking. With
Availability Zones, you can design and operate applications and databases that automatically
fail over between zones without interruption. Availability Zones are more highly available,
fault tolerant, and scalable than traditional single or multiple data center
infrastructures.

For more information about AWS Regions and Availability Zones, see [AWS Global
Infrastructure](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/ "https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/").

In addition to the AWS global infrastructure, Wickr offers several features to
help support your data resiliency and backup needs. For more information, see [Data retention for AWS Wickr](data-retention.md "data-retention.md").
