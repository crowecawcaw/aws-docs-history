# Federated identity

As a best practice, require human users to use federation with an identity provider to access AWS services using temporary credentials.

A _federated identity_ is a user from your enterprise directory, web identity provider, or AWS Directory Service that accesses AWS services using credentials from an identity source. Federated identities assume roles that provide temporary credentials.

For centralized access management, we recommend AWS IAM Identity Center. For more information, see [What is IAM Identity Center?](../../../singlesignon/latest/userguide/what-is.md "../../../singlesignon/latest/userguide/what-is.md") in the _AWS IAM Identity Center User Guide_.
