# Amazon SageMaker HyperPod

SageMaker HyperPod helps you provision resilient clusters for running machine learning (ML)
workloads and developing state-of-the-art models such as large language models (LLMs),
diffusion models, and foundation models (FMs). It accelerates development of FMs by removing
undifferentiated heavy-lifting involved in building and maintaining large-scale compute
clusters powered by thousands of accelerators such as AWS Trainium and NVIDIA A100 and
H100 Graphical Processing Units (GPUs). When accelerators fail, the resiliency features of
SageMaker HyperPod monitor the cluster instances automatically detect and replace the faulty
hardware on the fly so that you can focus on running ML workloads.

To get started, check [Prerequisites for using
SageMaker HyperPod](sagemaker-hyperpod-prerequisites.md "sagemaker-hyperpod-prerequisites.md"), set up [AWS Identity and Access Management for SageMaker HyperPod](sagemaker-hyperpod-prerequisites-iam.md "sagemaker-hyperpod-prerequisites-iam.md"), and choose one of the following
orchestrator options supported by SageMaker HyperPod.

**Slurm support in SageMaker HyperPod**

SageMaker HyperPod provides support for running machine learning workloads on resilient clusters
by integrating with Slurm, an open-source workload manager. Slurm support in SageMaker HyperPod
enables seamless cluster orchestration through Slurm cluster configuration, allowing you to
set up head, login, and worker nodes on the SageMaker HyperPod clusters This integration also
facilitates Slurm-based job scheduling for running ML workloads on the cluster, as well as
direct access to cluster nodes for job scheduling. With HyperPod's lifecycle
configuration support, you can customize the computing environment of the clusters to meet
your specific requirements. Additionally, by leveraging the Amazon SageMaker AI distributed training
libraries, you can optimize the clusters' performance on AWS computing and network
resources. To learn more, see [Orchestrating SageMaker HyperPod clusters with
Slurm](sagemaker-hyperpod-slurm.md "sagemaker-hyperpod-slurm.md").

**Amazon EKS support in SageMaker HyperPod**

SageMaker HyperPod also integrates with Amazon EKS to enable large-scale training of foundation
models on long-running and resilient compute clusters. This allows cluster admin users to
provision HyperPod clusters and attach them to an EKS control plane, enabling
dynamic capacity management, direct access to cluster instances, and resiliency
capabilities. For data scientists, Amazon EKS support in HyperPod allows running
containerized workloads for training foundation models, inference on the EKS cluster, and
leveraging the job auto-resume capability for Kubeflow PyTorch training. The architecture
involves a 1-to-1 mapping between an EKS cluster (control plane) and a HyperPod
cluster (worker nodes) within a VPC, providing a tightly integrated solution for running
large-scale ML workloads. To learn more, see [Orchestrating SageMaker HyperPod clusters with
Amazon EKS](sagemaker-hyperpod-eks.md "sagemaker-hyperpod-eks.md").

**UltraServers with HyperPod**

HyperPod with UltraServers delivers AI computing power by integrating
NVIDIA superchips into a cohesive, high-performance infrastructure. Each NVL72 UltraServer
combines 18 instances with 72 NVIDIA Blackwell GPUs interconnected via NVLink, enabling
faster inference and faster training performance compared to previous generation instances. This
architecture is particularly valuable for organizations working with trillion-parameter foundation
models, as the unified GPU memory allows entire models to remain within a single
NVLink domain, eliminating cross-node networking bottlenecks. HyperPod
enhances this hardware advantage
with intelligent topology-aware scheduling that optimizes workload placement, automatic instance
replacement to minimize disruptions, and flexible deployment options that support both dedicated and
shared resource configurations. For teams pushing the boundaries of model size and performance, this
integration provides the computational foundation needed to train and deploy the most advanced AI
models with unprecedented efficiency.

SageMaker HyperPod automatically optimizes instance placement across your UltraServers.
By default, HyperPod prioritizes all instances in one UltraServer before using a different one.
For example, if you want 14 instances and have 2 UltraServers in your plan, SageMaker AI uses all of the
instances in the first UltraServer. If you want 20 instances, SageMaker AI uses all 18 instances in the first
UltraServer and then uses 2 more from the second.
