<a name="endpoint-auto-scaling-add-code-define"></a>

Before you add a scaling policy to your model, save your policy configuration as a JSON block in a text file. You use that text file when invoking the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) or the Application Auto Scaling API. You can optimize scaling by choosing an appropriate CloudWatch metric. However, before using a custom metric in production, you must test auto scaling with your custom metric.

This section shows you example policy configurations for target tracking scaling policies.

## Specify a predefined metric (CloudWatch metric: InvocationsPerInstance)
<a name="endpoint-auto-scaling-add-code-predefined"></a>

**Example**  
The following is an example target tracking policy configuration for a variant that keeps the average invocations per instance at 70. Save this configuration in a file named `config.json`.  

```
{
    "TargetValue": {{70.0}},
    "PredefinedMetricSpecification":
    {
        "PredefinedMetricType": "SageMakerVariantInvocationsPerInstance"
    }
}
```
For more information, see [TargetTrackingScalingPolicyConfiguration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/application/APIReference/API_TargetTrackingScalingPolicyConfiguration.html) in the *Application Auto Scaling API Reference*.

## Specify a high-resolution predefined metric (CloudWatch metrics: ConcurrentRequestsPerModel and ConcurrentRequestsPerCopy)
<a name="endpoint-auto-scaling-add-code-high-res"></a>

With the following high-resolution CloudWatch metrics, you can set scaling policies for the volume of concurrent requests that your models receive:

**ConcurrentRequestsPerModel**  
The number of concurrent requests being received by a model container.

**ConcurrentRequestsPerCopy**  
The number of concurrent requests being received by an inference component.

These metrics track the number of simultaneous requests that your model containers handle, including the requests that are queued inside the containers. For models that send their inference response as a stream of tokens, these metrics track each request until the model sends the last token for the request.

As high-resolution metrics, they emit data more frequently than standard CloudWatch metrics. Standard metrics, such as the `InvocationsPerInstance` metric, emit data once every minute. However, these high-resolution metrics emit data every 10 seconds. Therefore, as the concurrent traffic to your models increases, your policy reacts by scaling out much more quickly than it would for standard metrics. However, as the traffic to your models decreases, your policy scales in at the same speed as it would for standard metrics.

The following is an example target tracking policy configuration that adds instances if the number of concurrent requests per model exceeds 5. Save this configuration in a file named `config.json`.

```
{
    "TargetValue": 5.0,
    "PredefinedMetricSpecification":
    {
        "PredefinedMetricType": "SageMakerVariantConcurrentRequestsPerModelHighResolution"
    }
}
```

If you use inference components to deploy multiple models to the same endpoint, you can create an equivalent policy. In that case, set `PredefinedMetricType` to `SageMakerInferenceComponentConcurrentRequestsPerCopyHighResolution`.

## Define a custom metric (CloudWatch metric: CPUUtilization)
<a name="endpoint-auto-scaling-add-code-custom"></a>

To create a target tracking scaling policy with a custom metric, specify the metric's name, namespace, unit, statistic, and zero or more dimensions. A dimension consists of a dimension name and a dimension value. You can use any production variant metric that changes in proportion to capacity. 

**Example**  
The following example configuration shows a target tracking scaling policy with a custom metric. The policy scales the variant based on an average CPU utilization of 50 percent across all instances. Save this configuration in a file named `config.json`.  

```
{
    "TargetValue": {{50.0}},
    "CustomizedMetricSpecification":
    {
        "MetricName": "{{CPUUtilization}}",
        "Namespace": "{{/aws/sagemaker/Endpoints}}",
        "Dimensions": {{[
            {"Name": "EndpointName", "Value": "my-endpoint" },
            {"Name": "VariantName","Value": "my-variant"}
        ]}},
        "Statistic": "{{Average}}",
        "Unit": "{{Percent}}"
    }
}
```
For more information, see [CustomizedMetricSpecification](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/application/APIReference/API_CustomizedMetricSpecification.html) in the *Application Auto Scaling API Reference*. 

## Define a custom metric (CloudWatch metric: ExplanationsPerInstance)
<a name="endpoint-auto-scaling-online-explainability"></a>

When the endpoint has online explainability activated, it emits a `ExplanationsPerInstance` metric that outputs the average number of records explained per minute, per instance, for a variant. The resource utilization of explaining records can be more different than that of predicting records. We strongly recommend using this metric for target tracking scaling of endpoints with online explainability activated.

You can create multiple target tracking policies for a scalable target. Consider adding the `InvocationsPerInstance` policy from the [Specify a predefined metric (CloudWatch metric: InvocationsPerInstance)](#endpoint-auto-scaling-add-code-predefined) section (in addition to the `ExplanationsPerInstance` policy). If most invocations don't return an explanation because of the threshold value set in the `EnableExplanations` parameter, then the endpoint can choose the `InvocationsPerInstance` policy. If there is a large number of explanations, the endpoint can use the `ExplanationsPerInstance` policy. 

**Example**  
The following example configuration shows a target tracking scaling policy with a custom metric. The policy scale adjusts the number of variant instances so that each instance has an `ExplanationsPerInstance` metric of 20. Save this configuration in a file named `config.json`.  

```
{
    "TargetValue": {{20.0}},
    "CustomizedMetricSpecification":
    {
        "MetricName": "{{ExplanationsPerInstance}}",
        "Namespace": "{{AWS/SageMaker}}",
        "Dimensions": {{[
            {"Name": "EndpointName", "Value": "my-endpoint" },
            {"Name": "VariantName","Value": "my-variant"}
        ],}}
        "Statistic": "{{Sum}}"
    }
}
```

## Specify cooldown periods
<a name="endpoint-auto-scaling-add-code-cooldown"></a>

You can optionally define cooldown periods in your target tracking scaling policy by specifying the `ScaleOutCooldown` and `ScaleInCooldown` parameters. 

**Example**  
The following is an example target tracking policy configuration for a variant that keeps the average invocations per instance at 70. The policy configuration provides a scale-in cooldown period of 10 minutes (600 seconds) and a scale-out cooldown period of 5 minutes (300 seconds). Save this configuration in a file named `config.json`.   

```
{
    "TargetValue": {{70.0}},
    "PredefinedMetricSpecification":
    {
        "PredefinedMetricType": "SageMakerVariantInvocationsPerInstance"
    },
    "ScaleInCooldown": {{600}},
    "ScaleOutCooldown": {{300}}
}
```
