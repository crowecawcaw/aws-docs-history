# Deploy models for inference

With Amazon SageMaker AI, you can start getting predictions, or _inferences_, from your trained machine learning models. SageMaker AI provides a broad
selection of ML infrastructure and model deployment options to help meet all your ML
inference needs. With SageMaker AI Inference, you can scale your model deployment, manage models
more effectively in production, and reduce operational burden. SageMaker AI provides you with
various inference options, such as real-time endpoints for getting low latency inference,
serverless endpoints for fully managed infrastructure and auto-scaling, and asynchronous
endpoints for batches of requests. By leveraging the appropriate inference option for your
use case, you can ensure efficient model deployment and inference.

## Choosing a feature

There are several use cases for deploying ML models with SageMaker AI. This section describes
those use cases, as well as the SageMaker AI feature we recommend for each use case.

### Use cases

The following are the main uses cases for deploying ML models with SageMaker AI.

- Use case 1: Deploy a machine learning model in a
  low-code or no-code environment. For beginners or those new to
  SageMaker AI, you can deploy pre-trained models using Amazon SageMaker JumpStart through the
  Amazon SageMaker Studio interface, without the need for complex
  configurations.
- Use case 2: Use code to deploy machine learning
  models with more flexibility and control. Experienced ML
  practitioners can deploy their own models with customized settings for their
  application needs using the `ModelBuilder` class in the SageMaker AI
  Python SDK, which provides fine-grained control over various settings, such
  as instance types, network isolation, and resource allocation.
- Use case 3: Deploy machine learning models at
  scale. For advanced users and organizations who want to manage
  models at scale in production, use the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) and CloudFormation along with
  your desired Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and CI/CD tools to provision
  resources and automate resource management.

### Additional options

SageMaker AI provides different options for your inference use cases, giving you choice
over the technical breadth and depth of your deployments:

- **Deploying a model to an endpoint.**
  When deploying your model, consider the following options:
  - [Real-time inference](realtime-endpoints.md "realtime-endpoints.md").
    Real-time inference is ideal for inference workloads where you have
    interactive, low latency requirements.
  - [Deploy models with Amazon SageMaker Serverless Inference](serverless-endpoints.md "serverless-endpoints.md").
    Use Serverless Inference to deploy models without configuring or managing any of the underlying infrastructure.
    This option is ideal for workloads which have idle periods between traffic spurts and can tolerate cold starts.
  - [Asynchronous inference](async-inference.md "async-inference.md"). Queues incoming requests
    and processes them asynchronously. This option is ideal for requests
    with large payload sizes (up to 1GB), long processing times (up to
    one hour), and near real-time latency requirements.

- **Cost optimization.** To optimize
  your inference costs, consider the following options:
  - [Model performance optimization with SageMaker Neo](neo.md "neo.md"). Use SageMaker Neo to
    optimize and run your machine learning models with better performance
    and efficiency, helping you to minimize compute costs by automatically
    optimizing models to run in environments like AWS Inferentia chips.
  - [Automatic scaling of Amazon SageMaker AI models](endpoint-auto-scaling.md "endpoint-auto-scaling.md"). Use autoscaling to dynamically adjust
    the compute resources for your endpoints based on incoming traffic patterns,
    which helps you optimize costs by only paying for the resources you're using at
    a given time.
