# Model quality

Model quality monitoring jobs monitor the performance of a model by comparing the
predictions that the model makes with the actual Ground Truth labels that the model attempts to
predict. To do this, model quality monitoring merges data that is captured from
real-time or batch inference with actual labels that you store in an Amazon S3 bucket, and
then compares the predictions with the actual labels.

To measure model quality, model monitor uses metrics that depend on the ML problem
type. For example, if your model is for a regression problem, one of the metrics
evaluated is mean square error (mse). For information about all of the metrics used for
the different ML problem types, see [Model quality metrics and Amazon CloudWatch monitoring](model-monitor-model-quality-metrics.md "model-monitor-model-quality-metrics.md").

Model quality monitoring follows the same steps as data quality monitoring, but adds
the additional step of merging the actual labels from Amazon S3 with the predictions captured
from the real-time inference endpoint or batch transform job. To monitor model quality,
follow these steps:

- Enable data capture. This captures inference input and output from a real-time
  inference endpoint or batch transform job and stores the data in Amazon S3. For more
  information, see [Data capture](model-monitor-data-capture.md "model-monitor-data-capture.md").
- Create a baseline. In this step, you run a baseline job that compares
  predictions from the model with Ground Truth labels in a baseline dataset. The baseline
  job automatically creates baseline statistical rules and constraints that define
  thresholds against which the model performance is evaluated. For more
  information, see [Create a model quality
  baseline](model-monitor-model-quality-baseline.md "model-monitor-model-quality-baseline.md").
- Define and schedule model quality monitoring jobs. For specific information
  and code samples of model quality monitoring jobs, see [Schedule model quality
  monitoring jobs](model-monitor-model-quality-schedule.md "model-monitor-model-quality-schedule.md"). For general
  information about monitoring jobs, see [Schedule monitoring jobs](model-monitor-scheduling.md "model-monitor-scheduling.md").
- Ingest Ground Truth labels that model monitor merges with captured prediction data
  from a real-time inference endpoint or batch transform job. For more
  information, see [Ingest Ground Truth labels and merge them with predictions](model-monitor-model-quality-merge.md "model-monitor-model-quality-merge.md").
- Integrate model quality monitoring with Amazon CloudWatch. For more information, see
  [Monitoring model quality metrics with CloudWatch](model-monitor-model-quality-metrics.md#model-monitor-model-quality-cw "model-monitor-model-quality-metrics.md#model-monitor-model-quality-cw").
- Interpret the results of a monitoring job. For more information, see [Interpret results](model-monitor-interpreting-results.md "model-monitor-interpreting-results.md").
- Use SageMaker Studio to enable model quality monitoring and visualize results. For
  more information, see [Visualize results for
  real-time endpoints in Amazon SageMaker Studio](model-monitor-interpreting-visualize-results.md "model-monitor-interpreting-visualize-results.md").
