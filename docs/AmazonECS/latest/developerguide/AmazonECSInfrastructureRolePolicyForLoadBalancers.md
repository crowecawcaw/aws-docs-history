# Amazon ECS infrastructure

IAM role for load balancers

An Amazon ECS infrastructure IAM role for load balancers allows Amazon ECS to manage load balancer
resources in your clusters on your behalf, and is used when:

- You want to use blue/green deployments with Amazon ECS. The infrastructure role allows
  Amazon ECS to manage load balancer resources for your deployments.
- You need Amazon ECS to create, modify, or delete load balancer resources such as target
  groups and listeners during deployment operations.
  When Amazon ECS assumes this role to take actions on your behalf, the events will be visible in
  AWS CloudTrail. If Amazon ECS uses the role to manage load balancer resources for your blue/green
  deployments, the CloudTrail log `roleSessionName` will be
  `ECSNetworkingWithELB` or `ecs-service-scheduler`. You can use
  this name to search events in the CloudTrail console by filtering for **User
  name**.

Amazon ECS provides a managed policy which contains the permissions required for load balancer
management. For more information see, [AmazonECSInfrastructureRolePolicyForLoadBalancers](../../../aws-managed-policy/latest/reference/AmazonECSInfrastructureRolePolicyForLoadBalancers.md "../../../aws-managed-policy/latest/reference/AmazonECSInfrastructureRolePolicyForLoadBalancers.md") in the _AWS Managed Policy Reference Guide_.

## Creating the Amazon ECS

infrastructure role for load balancers

Replace all `user input` with your own
information.

1. Create a file named `ecs-infrastructure-trust-policy.json` that
   contains the trust policy to use for the IAM role. The file should contain the
   following:

JSON

```
`{
 "Version":"2012-10-17",
 "Statement": [
 {
 "Sid": "AllowAccessToECSForInfrastructureManagement",
 "Effect": "Allow",
 "Principal": {
 "Service": "ecs.amazonaws.com"
 },
 "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
 }
 ]
}`

```

2. Use the following AWS CLI command to create a role named
   `ecsInfrastructureRoleForLoadBalancers` by using the trust policy
   that you created in the previous step.

```
`aws iam create-role \
 --role-name `ecsInfrastructureRoleForLoadBalancers` \
 --assume-role-policy-document file://`ecs-infrastructure-trust-policy.json``
```

3. Attach the AWS managed
   `AmazonECSInfrastructureRolePolicyForLoadBalancers` policy to the
   `ecsInfrastructureRoleForLoadBalancers` role.

```
`aws iam attach-role-policy \
 --role-name `ecsInfrastructureRoleForLoadBalancers` \
 --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonECSInfrastructureRolePolicyForLoadBalancers`
```

You can also use the IAM console's **Custom trust policy** workflow
to create the role. For more information, see [Creating a role using
custom trust policies (console)](../../../IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-custom.md "../../../IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-custom.md") in the _IAM User
Guide_.

###### Important

If the infrastructure role is being used by Amazon ECS to manage load balancer
resources for your blue/green deployments, ensure the following before you delete or
modify the role:

- The role isn't deleted while active deployments are in progress.
- The trust policy for the role isn't modified to remove Amazon ECS access
  (`ecs.amazonaws.com`).
- The managed policy
  `AmazonECSInfrastructureRolePolicyForLoadBalancers` isn't
  removed while active deployments are in progress.
  Deleting or modifying the role during active blue/green deployments may result in
  deployment failures and could leave your services in an inconsistent state.

After you create the file, you must grant your user permission to pass the role to
Amazon ECS.

## Permission to pass

the infrastructure role to Amazon ECS

To use an ECS infrastructure IAM role for load balancers, you must grant your user
permission to pass the role to Amazon ECS. Attach the following `iam:PassRole`
permission to your user. Replace
`ecsInfrastructureRoleForLoadBalancers` with the name of
the infrastructure role that you created.

JSON

```
`{
 "Version":"2012-10-17",
 "Statement": [
 {
 "Action": "iam:PassRole",
 "Effect": "Allow",
 "Resource": ["arn:aws:iam::*:role/`ecsInfrastructureRoleForLoadBalancers`"],
 "Condition": {
 "StringEquals": {"iam:PassedToService": "ecs.amazonaws.com"}
 }
 }
 ]
}`

```

For more information about `iam:Passrole` and updating permissions for your
user, see [Granting a user permissions to
pass a role to an AWS service](../../../IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use_passrole.md "../../../IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use_passrole.md") and [Changing permissions for
an IAM user](../../../IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_users_change-permissions.md "../../../IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_users_change-permissions.md") in the _AWS Identity and Access Management User
Guide_.
