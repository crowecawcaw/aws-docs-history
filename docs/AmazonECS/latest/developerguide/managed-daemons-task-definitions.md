# Daemon task definitions

A daemon task definition is the blueprint for your daemon. Amazon ECS Managed Daemons use a
dedicated daemon task definition resource, distinct from standard Amazon ECS task definitions.
You register a daemon task definition to specify the container image, resource requirements,
and configuration for your daemon.

## Creating a daemon task definition

You can create a daemon task definition by using the AWS Management Console or the AWS CLI.

### Using the AWS Management Console

1. Open the Amazon ECS console. In the left navigation, choose **Daemon
   task definitions**.
2. Choose **Create new daemon task definition**.
3. For **Daemon task definition family**, enter a unique
   name. The name can contain up to 255 alphanumeric characters, hyphens, and
   underscores.
4. (Optional) For **Task role**, choose an IAM role that
   grants permissions to the applications running in your containers. Leave
   this blank if your containers do not call AWS APIs.
5. (Optional) For **Task execution role**, select
   `ecsTaskExecutionRole`. Amazon ECS requires this role to pull
   container images and publish logs.
6. (Optional) For **Task size**, specify the CPU and memory
   to reserve for your daemon. For example, `0.25 vCPU` and
   `512 MB` memory.
7. Configure your container details:
   - **Container name** - Enter a name
     for your container. The name can contain up to 255 alphanumeric
     characters, hyphens, and underscores.
   - **Essential container** - Select
     **Yes**. Each daemon task definition requires
     at least one essential container. If an essential container fails,
     Amazon ECS stops the entire task.
   - **Image URI** - Enter the Docker
     image URI. You can browse Amazon ECR images or use public images from
     Docker Hub or other registries.

8. (Optional) Configure resource allocation, health check, environment
   variables, log collection, and tags as needed.
9. Review your configuration and choose **Create**.

### Using the AWS CLI

Register a daemon task definition by creating a JSON file and using the
`register-daemon-task-definition` command.

The following is an example JSON file:

```
{
    "family": "my-daemon-task",
    "containerDefinitions": [
        {
            "name": "daemon-container",
            "image": "public.ecr.aws/docker/library/busybox:latest",
            "essential": true,
            "command": ["sh", "-c", "while true; do echo 'Daemon running'; sleep 30; done"],
            "memoryReservation": 512
        }
    ]
}
```

Run the following command to register the daemon task definition:

```
aws ecs register-daemon-task-definition --cli-input-json file://daemon-taskdef.json
```

## Daemon task definition parameters

You can use the following parameters when you register a daemon task
definition.

**Required parameters**

- `family` - The task definition family name. This groups multiple
  revisions of the same daemon task definition.
- `containerDefinitions` - An array of
  `DaemonContainerDefinition` objects that describe the containers
  in your daemon task.

**Optional parameters**

- `cpu` - Task-level CPU units as a string (for example,
  `"256"`).
- `memory` - Task-level memory in MiB as a string (for example,
  `"512"`).
- `taskRoleArn` - The ARN of the IAM role that grants permissions
  to the containers in your daemon task.
- `executionRoleArn` - The ARN of the IAM role that the Amazon ECS
  container agent uses to make AWS API calls on your behalf (for example,
  pulling images from Amazon ECR).
- `volumes` - An array of `DaemonVolume` objects. Daemon
  volumes support only bind mounts with `host` and
  `sourcePath`. Daemon task definitions do not support Amazon EBS,
  Amazon EFS, FSx for Windows File Server, Docker volumes, or ephemeral
  storage.
- `tags` - An array of key-value pairs to tag your daemon task
  definition.

## Network mode

Daemons use a special `daemon_bridge` network mode that Amazon ECS sets
automatically. You cannot specify a network mode in your daemon task definition. All
daemons on an instance share a single network namespace and are accessible locally via a
static daemon bridge IP address (`169.254.172.2` for IPv4, or
`fd00:ec2::172:2` for IPv6). Application tasks (non-daemons) can
communicate with daemons at this address without additional network
configuration.

Because daemons run in a separate network namespace from application tasks,
non-daemon tasks don't need to worry about port conflicts with daemons. However, since
all daemon tasks share the same namespace, daemons on the same instance cannot bind to
the same port. When deploying multiple daemons, ensure each daemon uses a unique
port.

## Privileged capabilities

On Amazon ECS Managed Instances, daemons support privileged Linux capabilities for system-level
operations. Security agents, network monitoring tools, and observability agents often
require kernel-level access to function correctly.

You can grant capabilities in two ways:

**Full privileged mode** grants all Linux capabilities to
the container. Use this when your agent requires broad system access:

```
{
    "containerDefinitions": [{
        "name": "security-daemon",
        "image": "my-security-agent:latest",
        "privileged": true
    }]
}
```

**Individual capabilities** grant only the permissions
your daemon needs, following the principle of least privilege. Use the
`linuxParameters.capabilities` field to add individual capabilities such
as `SYS_ADMIN`, `NET_ADMIN`, `SYS_PTRACE`, and
`BPF`:

```
{
    "containerDefinitions": [{
        "name": "monitoring-daemon",
        "image": "my-monitoring-agent:latest",
        "linuxParameters": {
            "capabilities": {
                "add": ["NET_ADMIN", "SYS_PTRACE"]
            }
        }
    }]
}
```

## Volumes

Managed Daemons support bind mounts using host volumes with a
`sourcePath` specification. This allows daemon containers to mount host
directories to access logs, metrics, and system information on the underlying Amazon EC2
instance. Log collection agents, metrics exporters, and security scanners commonly use
this to gain visibility into host-level data.

The daemon task definition supports host volume specifications with
`sourcePath`. Daemon volumes persist for the lifecycle of the underlying
container instance.

###### Note

Amazon EBS volumes, Amazon EFS volumes, FSx for Windows File Server volumes, Docker
volumes, and ephemeral storage are not supported in daemon task definitions.

###### Note

Daemons do not support volume sharing between each other. Each daemon operates
with its own independent volume configuration.

The following example shows a log collector daemon with a bind mount:

```
{
    "containerDefinitions": [{
        "name": "log-collector",
        "image": "fluent/fluentd:latest",
        "mountPoints": [{
            "sourceVolume": "var-log",
            "containerPath": "/var/log"
        }]
    }],
    "volumes": [{
        "name": "var-log",
        "host": {
            "sourcePath": "/var/log"
        }
    }]
}
```
