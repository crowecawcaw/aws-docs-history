# Application Load Balancer resources for blue/green deployments

To use Application Load Balancers with Amazon ECS blue/green deployments, you need to configure specific resources that allow traffic routing between the blue and green service revisions.

## Target groups

For blue/green deployments with Elastic Load Balancing, you need to create two target groups:

- A primary target group for the blue service revision (current production traffic)
- An alternate target group for the green service revision (new version)

Both target groups should be configured with the following settings:

- Target type: `IP` (for Fargate or EC2
  with `awsvpc` network mode)
- Protocol: `HTTP` (or the protocol your application uses)
- Port: The port your application listens on (typically `80` for HTTP)
- VPC: The same VPC as your Amazon ECS tasks
- Health check settings: Configured to properly check your application's health

During a blue/green deployment, Amazon ECS automatically registers tasks with the appropriate target group based on the deployment stage.

###### Example Creating target groups for an Application Load Balancer

The following CLI commands create two target groups for use with an Application Load Balancer in a
blue/green deployment:

```
aws elbv2 create-target-group \
    --name `blue-target-group` \
    --protocol HTTP \
    --port 80 \
    --vpc-id `vpc-abcd1234` \
    --target-type ip \
    --health-check-path / \
    --health-check-protocol HTTP \
    --health-check-interval-seconds 30 \
    --health-check-timeout-seconds 5 \
    --healthy-threshold-count 2 \
    --unhealthy-threshold-count 2

aws elbv2 create-target-group \
    --name `green-target-group` \
    --protocol HTTP \
    --port 80 \
    --vpc-id `vpc-abcd1234` \
    --target-type ip \
    --health-check-path / \
    --health-check-protocol HTTP \
    --health-check-interval-seconds 30 \
    --health-check-timeout-seconds 5 \
    --healthy-threshold-count 2 \
    --unhealthy-threshold-count 2
```

## Application Load Balancer

You need to create an Application Load Balancer with the following configuration:

- Scheme: Internet-facing or internal, depending on your requirements
- IP address type: IPv4
- VPC: The same VPC as your Amazon ECS tasks
- Subnets: At least two subnets in different Availability Zones
- Security groups: A security group that allows traffic on the listener ports

The security group attached to the Application Load Balancer must have an outbound rule that allows traffic to the security group attached to your Amazon ECS tasks.

###### Example Creating an Application Load Balancer

The following CLI command creates anApplication Load Balancer for use in a blue/green
deployment:

```
aws elbv2 create-load-balancer \
    --name `my-application-load-balancer` \
    --type application \
    --security-groups `sg-abcd1234` \
    --subnets `subnet-12345678` `subnet-87654321`
```

## Listeners and rules

For blue/green deployments, you need to configure listeners on your Application Load Balancer:

- Production listener: Handles production traffic (typically on port 80 or 443)
  - Initially forwards traffic to the primary target group (blue service revision)
  - After deployment, forwards traffic to the alternate target group (green service revision)

- Test listener (optional): Handles test traffic to validate the green service revision before shifting production traffic
  - Can be configured on a different port (for example, 8080 or
  8443.
  - Forwards traffic to the alternate target group (green service revision) during testing

During a blue/green deployment, Amazon ECS automatically updates the listener rules to route traffic to the appropriate target group based on the deployment stage.

###### Example Creating a production listener

The following CLI command creates a production listener on port 80 that forwards traffic to the primary (blue) target group:

```
aws elbv2 create-listener \
    --load-balancer-arn `arn:aws:elasticloadbalancing:region:123456789012:loadbalancer/app/my-application-load-balancer/abcdef123456` \
    --protocol HTTP \
    --port 80 \
    --default-actions Type=forward,TargetGroupArn=`arn:aws:elasticloadbalancing:region:123456789012:targetgroup/blue-target-group/abcdef123456`
```

###### Example Creating a test listener

The following CLI command creates a test listener on port 8080 that forwards traffic to the alternate (green) target group:

```
aws elbv2 create-listener \
    --load-balancer-arn `arn:aws:elasticloadbalancing:region:123456789012:loadbalancer/app/my-application-load-balancer/abcdef123456` \
    --protocol HTTP \
    --port 8080 \
    --default-actions Type=forward,TargetGroupArn=`arn:aws:elasticloadbalancing:region:123456789012:targetgroup/green-target-group/ghijkl789012`
```

###### Example Creating a listener rule for path-based routing

The following CLI command creates a rule that forwards traffic for a specific path to the green target group for testing:

```
aws elbv2 create-rule \
    --listener-arn `arn:aws:elasticloadbalancing:region:123456789012:listener/app/my-application-load-balancer/abcdef123456/ghijkl789012` \
    --priority 10 \
    --conditions Field=path-pattern,Values='/test/*' \
    --actions Type=forward,TargetGroupArn=`arn:aws:elasticloadbalancing:region:123456789012:targetgroup/green-target-group/ghijkl789012`
```

###### Example Creating a listener rule for header-based routing

The following CLI command creates a rule that forwards traffic with a specific header to the green target group for testing:

```
aws elbv2 create-rule \
    --listener-arn `arn:aws:elasticloadbalancing:region:123456789012:listener/app/my-application-load-balancer/abcdef123456/ghijkl789012` \
    --priority 20 \
    --conditions Field=http-header,HttpHeaderConfig='{Name=X-Environment,Values=[test]}' \
    --actions Type=forward,TargetGroupArn=`arn:aws:elasticloadbalancing:region:123456789012:targetgroup/green-target-group/ghijkl789012`
```

## Service configuration

You must have permissions to allow Amazon ECS to manage load balancer resources in your clusters on your behalf. For more information, see [Amazon ECS infrastructure
IAM role for load balancers](AmazonECSInfrastructureRolePolicyForLoadBalancers.md "AmazonECSInfrastructureRolePolicyForLoadBalancers.md").

When creating or updating an Amazon ECS service for blue/green deployments with Elastic Load Balancing, you
need to specify the following configuration.

Replace the `user-input` with your values.

The key components in this configuration are:

- `targetGroupArn`: The ARN of the primary target group (blue
  service revision).
- `alternateTargetGroupArn`: The ARN of the alternate target group
  (green service revision).
- `productionListenerRule`: The ARN of the listener rule for
  production traffic.
- `roleArn`: The ARN of the role that allows Amazon ECS to manage Elastic Load Balancing
  resources.
- `strategy`: Set to `BLUE_GREEN` to enable blue/green
  deployments.
- `bakeTimeInMinutes`: The duration when both blue and green service
  revisions are running simultaneously after the production traffic has
  shifted.
- `TestListenerRule`: The ARN of the listener rule for test
  traffic. This is an optional parameter.

    }
}
```

## Traffic flow during deployment

During a blue/green deployment with Elastic Load Balancing, traffic flows through the system as follows:

1. _Initial state_: All production traffic is routed to the primary target group (blue service revision).
2. _Green service revision deployment_: Amazon ECS deploys the new tasks and registers them with the alternate target group.
3. _Test traffic_: If a test listener is configured, test traffic is routed to the alternate target group to validate the green service revision.
4. _Production traffic shift_: Amazon ECS updates the production listener rule to route traffic to the alternate target group (green service revision).
5. _Bake time_: The duration when both blue and green service
   revisions are running simultaneously after the production traffic has
   shifted.
6. _Completion_: After a successful deployment, the blue service revision is terminated.

If issues are detected during the deployment, Amazon ECS can automatically roll back by routing traffic back to the primary target group (blue service revision).
