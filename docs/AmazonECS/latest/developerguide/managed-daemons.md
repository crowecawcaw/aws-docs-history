# Amazon ECS Managed Daemons

Amazon ECS Managed Daemons enable you to deploy and manage software agents, such as
security, observability, and networking agents, across your container infrastructure on
Amazon ECS Managed Instances. Managed Daemons decouple daemon lifecycle management from
application operations. You can deploy, update, and monitor agents independently, without
redeploying workloads or coordinating changes across services.

## Daemon criticality

You can configure each managed daemon as critical or non-critical, based on whether
a daemon failure should cause Amazon ECS to drain the container instance.

- **Critical** - The default. Amazon ECS starts the
  daemon task before it places application tasks on the instance, and if the
  daemon task stops or becomes unhealthy, Amazon ECS drains and replaces the container
  instance.
- **Non-critical** - Set the `critical`
  parameter to `false`. The daemon task operates independently of
  container instance health. If a non-critical daemon task fails, stops, or
  becomes unhealthy, Amazon ECS keeps the container instance active. Existing
  application tasks keep running, and Amazon ECS keeps placing new application tasks on
  it. A non-critical daemon never blocks instance registration, so application
  tasks can be placed immediately even if the daemon fails to start.

## How Managed Daemons work

To use Managed Daemons, first register a daemon task definition. A daemon task
definition is a template that describes the containers that form a daemon. After you
register a daemon task definition, create a daemon and associate it with a cluster and
one or more Amazon ECS Managed Instances capacity providers. Amazon ECS then ensures that exactly one
daemon task runs on every Amazon EC2 instance provisioned through those capacity
providers.

Daemons do not launch instances independently. When you run an application task on a
Amazon ECS Managed Instances capacity provider, Amazon ECS provisions an Amazon EC2 instance, starts the
daemon task, and only then transitions the application task to `RUNNING`.
Amazon ECS uses this ordering for every daemon, regardless of criticality, so that
cross-cutting functions like logging, tracing, and metrics collection are operational
before your application begins processing requests.

Criticality controls what Amazon ECS does when a daemon task doesn't start, or stops
later. For a critical daemon, a task that fails to start keeps the instance from
becoming active. A task that stops or becomes unhealthy after the instance is active
causes Amazon ECS to drain and replace the instance. This auto-repair behavior maintains
reliable daemon coverage without manual intervention.

A non-critical daemon never blocks the instance and never triggers a drain. The
instance becomes active even if the daemon task fails to start, and stays active if the
daemon task stops or becomes unhealthy later. Your application tasks keep running, and
Amazon ECS keeps placing new application tasks on the instance.

When you update a daemon to a new task definition revision, Amazon ECS performs a rolling
deployment across all instances in the associated capacity providers. During the
deployment, Amazon ECS drains a configurable percentage of instances simultaneously,
provisions replacement instances with the updated daemon, and replaces your Amazon ECS
service tasks automatically. Amazon ECS provides built-in circuit breaker protection. You
can configure a bake time and CloudWatch alarms so that Amazon ECS monitors the deployment after
it updates all instances and automatically rolls back if issues arise. Amazon ECS emits an
EventBridge event and records a service action log when a daemon task fails to start,
for both critical and non-critical daemons.

## Key benefits

- **Decoupled lifecycle management** - Update
  daemons independently from application deployments.
- **Guaranteed coverage** - Amazon ECS starts the
  daemon task before application tasks on every instance, so cross-cutting
  functions are operational before your application begins processing requests.
  For a critical daemon, a daemon task that fails to start also keeps the instance
  from registering, so an instance never serves application tasks without its
  daemon.
- **Reliable version updates** - When you
  update a daemon version, Amazon ECS rolls it out across all instances in the
  associated capacity providers, with built-in circuit breaker protection and
  automatic rollback to ensure every instance runs the target revision.
- **Improved resource utilization** - Running
  a single daemon task per instance eliminates the sidecar-per-task model,
  reducing resource overhead across your cluster.
- **Automatic instance repair** - For a
  critical daemon, if the daemon task stops or becomes unhealthy, Amazon ECS
  automatically drains and replaces that container instance. This maintains
  reliable daemon coverage without manual intervention.
- **Workload continuity**

* Non-critical daemons keep your application workloads running uninterrupted,
  even if a daemon task fails, stops, or becomes unhealthy.

###### Note

Amazon ECS offers a DAEMON scheduling strategy for Amazon ECS services for the Amazon EC2 launch
type. Managed Daemons is a new capability built for Amazon ECS Managed Instances to
simplify daemon deployments and provide stronger daemon coverage guarantees.

## Getting started

To get started, register a daemon task definition specifying your container image,
then create a daemon with associated capacity providers in your cluster. You can use the
AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, CloudFormation, or AWS SDKs. For step-by-step instructions, see [Creating and managing daemons](managed-daemons-create-manage.md "managed-daemons-create-manage.md").
