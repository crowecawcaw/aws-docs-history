# Use fault injection with your Amazon ECS and Fargate workloads

Customers can utilize fault injection with Amazon ECS on both Amazon EC2 and Fargate to test how their
application responds to certain impairment scenarios. These tests provide information you can use to
optimize your application's performance and resiliency.

When fault injection is enabled, the Amazon ECS container agent allows tasks access to new
fault injection endpoints. You need to opt-in in order to use fault injection by setting the
`enableFaultInjection` task definition parameter value to `true`.
The default value is `false`.

```
{
    ...
   "enableFaultInjection": true
}
```

###### Note

Fault injection only works with tasks using the `awsvpc` or `host` network
modes.

Fault injection isn't available on Windows.

For information on how to enable fault injection in the AWS Management Console, see [Creating an Amazon ECS task definition
using the console](create-task-definition.md "create-task-definition.md").

You'll need to enable the feature for testing in the AWS Fault Injection Service. For more information, see [Use the AWS FIS aws:ecs:task
actions](../../../fis/latest/userguide/ecs-task-actions.md "../../../fis/latest/userguide/ecs-task-actions.md").

###### Note

If you don't use thenew Amazon ECS optimized AMIs, or have a custom AMI, install the
following dependencies:

- `tc`
- `sch_netem` kernel module
