# AWS Fargate throttling quotas

AWS Fargate limits Amazon ECS tasks and Amazon EKS pods launch rates to quotas (formerly
referred to as limits) using a [token bucket algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_bucket "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_bucket") for each AWS account on a per-Region basis. With
this algorithm, your account has a bucket that holds a specific number of tokens. The
number of tokens in the bucket represents your rate quota at any given second. Each
customer account has a tasks and pods token bucket that depletes based on the number of
tasks and pods launched by the customer account. This token bucket has a bucket maximum
that allows you to periodically make a higher number of requests, and a refill rate that
allows you to sustain a steady rate of requests for as long as needed.

For example, the tasks and pods token bucket size for a Fargate customer account is
100 tokens, and the refill rate is 20 tokens per second. Therefore, you can immediately
launch up to 100 Amazon ECS tasks and Amazon EKS pods per customer account, with a sustained
launch rate of 20 Amazon ECS tasks and Amazon EKS pods per second.

1Accounts launching only
Amazon EKS pods have a burst rate of 20 with a sustained pod launch rate of 20 pod launches
per second when using the platform versions called out in the [Amazon EKS
platform versions](../../../eks/latest/userguide/platform-versions.md "../../../eks/latest/userguide/platform-versions.md").

## Throttling the `RunTask` API in Fargate

In addition, Fargate limits the request rate when launching tasks using the
Amazon ECS `RunTask` API using a separate quota. Fargate limits Amazon ECS
`RunTask` API requests for each AWS account on a per-Region basis.
Each request that you make removes one token from the bucket. We do this to help the
performance of the service, and to ensure fair usage for all Fargate customers.
API calls are subject to the request quotas whether they originate from the
Amazon Elastic Container Service console, a command line tool, or a third-party application. The rate quota
for calls to the Amazon ECS `RunTask` API is 20 calls per second (burst and
sustained). Each call to this API can, however, launch up to 10 tasks. This means
you can launch 100 tasks in one second by making 10 calls to this API, requesting 10
tasks to be launched in each call. Similarly, you could also make 20 calls to this
API, requesting 5 tasks to be launched in each call. For more information on API
throttling for Amazon ECS `RunTask` API, see [API request
throttling](../APIReference/request-throttling.md "../APIReference/request-throttling.md") in the Amazon ECS API Reference.

In practice, task and pod launch rates are also dependent on other considerations
such as container images to be downloaded and unpacked, health checks and other
integrations enabled, such as registering tasks or pods into a load balancer.
Customers see variations in task and pod launch rates compared with the quotas
represented earlier based on the features that customers enable.

## Adjusting rate quotas in Fargate

You can request an increase for Fargate rate throttling quotas for your AWS
account. For more information, see [Requesting a quota
increase](../../../servicequotas/latest/userguide/request-quota-increase.md "../../../servicequotas/latest/userguide/request-quota-increase.md") in the _Service Quotas User
Guide_.
