# Amazon ECS service definition parameters

A service definition defines how to run your Amazon ECS service. The following parameters can
be specified in a service definition.

## Launch type

`launchType`

Type: String

Valid values: `EC2` | `FARGATE` | `EXTERNAL`

Required: No

The launch type on which to run your service. If a launch type is not specified,
the default `capacityProviderStrategy` is used by default.

When you update a service, this parameter triggers a new service deployment.

If a `launchType` is specified, the `capacityProviderStrategy` parameter must be omitted.

## Capacity provider strategy

`capacityProviderStrategy`

Type: Array of objects

Required: No

The capacity provider strategy to use for the service.

When you update a service, this parameter doesn't trigger a new service deployment.

A capacity provider strategy consists of one or more capacity providers
along with the `base` and `weight` to assign to them.
A capacity provider must be associated with the cluster to be used in a
capacity provider strategy. The PutClusterCapacityProviders API is used to
associate a capacity provider with a cluster. Only capacity providers with
an `ACTIVE` or `UPDATING` status can be used.

If a `capacityProviderStrategy` is specified, the
`launchType` parameter must be omitted. If no
`capacityProviderStrategy` or `launchType` is
specified, the `defaultCapacityProviderStrategy` for the cluster
is used.

If you want to specify a capacity provider that uses an Auto Scaling
group, the capacity provider must already be created. New capacity providers
can be created with the CreateCapacityProvider API operation.

To use an AWS Fargate capacity provider, specify either the
`FARGATE` or `FARGATE_SPOT` capacity providers.
The AWS Fargate capacity providers are available to all accounts and only need
to be associated with a cluster to be used.

The PutClusterCapacityProviders API operation is used to update the list
of available capacity providers for a cluster after the cluster is
created.

`capacityProvider`

Type: String

Required: Yes

The short name or full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the
capacity provider.

`weight`

Type: Integer

Valid range: Integers between 0 and 1,000.

Required: No

The weight value designates the relative percentage of the
total number of tasks launched that use the specified capacity
provider.

For example, assume that you have a strategy that contains two
capacity providers and both have a weight of one. When the base
is satisfied, the tasks split evenly across the two capacity
providers. Using that same logic, assume that you specify a
weight of 1 for _capacityProviderA_ and a
weight of 4 for _capacityProviderB_. Then,
for every one task that is run using
_capacityProviderA_, four tasks use
_capacityProviderB_.

`base`

Type: Integer

Valid range: Integers between 0 and 100,000.

Required: No

The base value designates how many tasks, at a minimum, to run
on the specified capacity provider. Only one capacity provider
in a capacity provider strategy can have a base defined.

## Task definition

`taskDefinition`

Type: String

Required: No

The `family` and `revision`
(`family:revision`) or full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the task definition
to run in your service. If a `revision` isn't specified, the
latest `ACTIVE` revision of the specified family is used.

When you update a service, this parameter triggers a new service deployment.

A task definition must be specified when using the rolling update
(`ECS`) deployment controller.

## Platform operating system

`platformFamily`

Type: string

Required: Conditional

Default: Linux

This parameter is required for Amazon ECS services hosted on Fargate.

This parameter is ignored for Amazon ECS services hosted on Amazon EC2.

The operating system on the containers that runs the service. The valid
values are `LINUX`, `WINDOWS_SERVER_2019_FULL`,
`WINDOWS_SERVER_2019_CORE`,
`WINDOWS_SERVER_2022_FULL`, and
`WINDOWS_SERVER_2022_CORE`.

The `platformFamily` value for every task that you specify for
the service must match the service `platformFamily` value. For
example, if you set the `platformFamily` to
`WINDOWS_SERVER_2019_FULL`, the `platformFamily`
value for all the tasks must be
`WINDOWS_SERVER_2019_FULL`.

## Platform version

`platformVersion`

Type: String

Required: No

The platform version on which your tasks in the service are running. A
platform version is only specified for tasks using the Fargate
launch type. If one is not specified, the latest version (`LATEST`)
is used by default.

When you update a service, this parameter triggers a new service deployment.

AWS Fargate platform versions are used to refer to a specific runtime
environment for the Fargate task infrastructure. When specifying
the `LATEST` platform version when running a task or creating a
service, you get the most current platform version available for your tasks.
When you scale up your service, those tasks receive the platform version that
was specified on the service's current deployment. For more information, see
[Fargate platform versions for Amazon ECS](platform-fargate.md "platform-fargate.md").

###### Note

Platform versions are not specified for tasks using the EC2
launch type.

## Cluster

`cluster`

Type: String

Required: No

The short name or full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the cluster on which to run your service.
If you do not specify a cluster, the `default` cluster is
assumed.

## Service name

`serviceName`

Type: String

Required: Yes

The name of your service. Up to 255 letters (uppercase and lowercase), numbers, hyphens, and underscores are allowed. Service names must be unique
within a cluster, but you can have similarly named services in multiple clusters
within a Region or across multiple Regions.

## Scheduling strategy

`schedulingStrategy`

Type: String

Valid values: `REPLICA` | `DAEMON`

Required: No

The scheduling strategy to use. If no scheduling strategy is specified,
the `REPLICA` strategy is used. For more information, see [Amazon ECS services](ecs_services.md "ecs_services.md").

There are two service scheduler
strategies available:

- `REPLICA`—The replica scheduling strategy places and
  maintains the desired number of tasks across your cluster. By default, the
  service scheduler spreads tasks across Availability Zones. You can use task
  placement strategies and constraints to customize task placement decisions. For
  more information, see [Replica scheduling strategy](ecs_service-options.md#service_scheduler_replica "ecs_service-options.md#service_scheduler_replica").
- `DAEMON`—The daemon scheduling strategy deploys exactly one
  task on each active container instance that meets all of the task placement
  constraints that you specify in your cluster. When using this strategy, there is no need to
  specify a desired number of tasks, a task placement strategy, or use Service
  Auto Scaling policies. For more information, see [Daemon scheduling strategy](ecs_service-options.md#service_scheduler_daemon "ecs_service-options.md#service_scheduler_daemon").

###### Note

Fargate tasks do not support the `DAEMON`
scheduling strategy.

## Desired count

`desiredCount`

Type: Integer

Required: No

The number of instantiations of the specified task definition to place and
keep running in your service.

When you update a service, this parameter doesn't trigger a new service deployment.

This parameter is required if the `REPLICA` scheduling strategy
is used. If the service uses the `DAEMON` scheduling strategy,
this parameter is optional.

When you use service auto scaling, when you update a currently running
service with a `desiredCount` less than the number of tasks
currently running, the service scales down to the specified
`desiredCount`.

## Deployment configuration

`deploymentConfiguration`

Type: Object

Required: No

Optional deployment parameters that control how many tasks run during the
deployment and the ordering of stopping and starting tasks.

When you update a service, this parameter doesn't trigger a new service deployment.

`maximumPercent`

Type: Integer

Required: No

If a service is using the rolling update (`ECS`)
deployment type, the `maximumPercent` parameter
represents an upper limit on the number of your service's tasks
that are allowed in the `RUNNING`,
`STOPPING`, or `PENDING` state during
a deployment. It is expressed as a percentage of the
`desiredCount` that is rounded down to the
nearest integer. You can use this parameter to define the
deployment batch size. For example, if your service is using the
`REPLICA` service scheduler and has a
`desiredCount` of four tasks and a
`maximumPercent` value of 200%, the scheduler
starts four new tasks before stopping the four older tasks. This
is provided that the cluster resources required to do this are
available. The default `maximumPercent` value for a
service using the `REPLICA` service scheduler is
200%.

The Amazon ECS scheduler uses this parameter to replace unhealthy
tasks by starting replacement tasks first and then stopping the
unhealthy tasks, as long as cluster resources for starting
replacement tasks are available. For more information about how
the scheduler replaces unhealthy tasks, see [Amazon ECS services](ecs_services.md "ecs_services.md").

If your service is using the `DAEMON` service
scheduler type, the `maximumPercent` should remain at
100%. This is the default value.

The maximum number of tasks during a deployment is the
`desiredCount` multiplied by the
`maximumPercent`/100, rounded down to the nearest
integer value.

If a service is using either the blue/green
(`CODE_DEPLOY`) or `EXTERNAL`
deployment types and tasks that use the EC2 launch
type, the **maximum percent** value
is set to the default value. The value is used to define the
upper limit on the number of the tasks in the service that
remain in the `RUNNING` state while the container
instances are in the `DRAINING` state.

###### Note

You can't specify a custom `maximumPercent`
value for a service that uses either the blue/green
(`CODE_DEPLOY`) or `EXTERNAL`
deployment types and has tasks that use the
EC2.

If the service uses either the blue/green
(`CODE_DEPLOY`) or `EXTERNAL`
deployment types, and the tasks in the service use the
Fargate, the maximum percent value is
not used. The value is still returned when describing your
service.

`minimumHealthyPercent`

Type: Integer

Required: No

If a service is using the rolling update (`ECS`)
deployment type, the `minimumHealthyPercent`
represents a lower limit on the number of your service's tasks
that must remain in the `RUNNING` state during a
deployment. This is expressed as a percentage of the
`desiredCount` that is rounded up to the nearest
integer. You can use this parameter to deploy without using
additional cluster capacity.

For example, if your service has a `desiredCount`
of four tasks, a `minimumHealthyPercent` of 50%, and
a `maximumPercent` of 100%, the service scheduler
stops two existing tasks to free up cluster capacity before
starting two new tasks.

If any tasks are unhealthy and if `maximumPercent`
doesn't allow the Amazon ECS scheduler to start replacement tasks,
the scheduler stops the unhealthy tasks one-by-one — using the
`minimumHealthyPercent` as a constraint — to
clear up capacity to launch replacement tasks. For more
information about how the scheduler replaces unhealthy tasks,
see [Amazon ECS services](ecs_services.md "ecs_services.md").

For services that _do not_ use a load
balancer, consider the following:

- A service is considered healthy if all essential
  containers within the tasks in the service pass their
  health checks.
- If a task has no essential containers with a health
  check defined, the service scheduler waits for 40
  seconds after a task reaches a `RUNNING`
  state before the task is counted towards the minimum
  healthy percent total.
- If a task has one or more essential containers with a
  health check defined, the service scheduler waits for
  the task to reach a healthy status before counting it
  towards the minimum healthy percent total. A task is
  considered healthy when all essential containers within
  the task have passed their health checks. The amount of
  time the service scheduler can wait for is determined by
  the container health check settings. For more
  information, see [Health check](task_definition_parameters.md#container_definition_healthcheck "task_definition_parameters.md#container_definition_healthcheck").

For services that _do_ use a load balancer,
consider the following:

- If a task has no essential containers with a health
  check defined, the service scheduler waits for the load
  balancer target group health check to return a healthy
  status before counting the task towards the minimum
  healthy percent total.
- If a task has an essential container with a health
  check defined, the service scheduler waits for both the
  task to reach a healthy status and the load balancer
  target group health check to return a healthy status
  before counting the task towards the minimum healthy
  percent total.

The default value for a replica service for
`minimumHealthyPercent` is 100%. The default
`minimumHealthyPercent` value for a service using
the `DAEMON` service schedule is 0% for the AWS CLI,
the AWS SDKs, and the APIs and 50% for the AWS Management Console.

The minimum number of healthy tasks during a deployment is the
`desiredCount` multiplied by the
`minimumHealthyPercent`/100, rounded up to the
nearest integer value.

If a service is using either the blue/green
(`CODE_DEPLOY`) or `EXTERNAL`
deployment types and is running tasks that use the
EC2, the **minimum
healthy percent** value is set to the default
value. The value is used to define the lower limit on the number
of the tasks in the service that remain in the
`RUNNING` state while the container instances are
in the `DRAINING` state.

###### Note

You can't specify a custom `maximumPercent`
value for a service that uses either the blue/green
(`CODE_DEPLOY`) or `EXTERNAL`
deployment types and has tasks that use the
EC2.

If a service is using either the blue/green
(`CODE_DEPLOY`) or `EXTERNAL`
deployment types and is running tasks that use
Fargate, the minimum healthy percent
value is not used, although it is returned when describing your
service.

## Deployment controller

`deploymentController`

Type: Object

Required: No

The deployment controller to use for the service. If no deployment
controller is specified, the `ECS` controller is used. For more
information, see [Amazon ECS services](ecs_services.md "ecs_services.md").

When you update a service, this parameter doesn't trigger a new service deployment.

`type`

Type: String

Valid values: `ECS` | `CODE_DEPLOY` |
`EXTERNAL`

Required: yes

The deployment controller type to use. There are three
deployment controller types available:

`ECS`

The rolling update (`ECS`) deployment
type involves replacing the current running version
of the container with the latest version. The number
of containers Amazon ECS adds or removes from the service
during a rolling update is controlled by adjusting
the minimum and maximum number of healthy tasks
allowed during a service deployment, as specified in
the [deploymentConfiguration](#deploymentConfiguration "#deploymentConfiguration").

`CODE_DEPLOY`

The blue/green (`CODE_DEPLOY`)
deployment type uses the blue/green deployment model
powered by CodeDeploy, which allows you to verify a new
deployment of a service before sending production
traffic to it.

`EXTERNAL`

Use the external deployment type when you want to
use any third-party deployment controller for full
control over the deployment process for an Amazon ECS
service.

## Task placement

`placementConstraints`

Type: Array of objects

Required: No

An array of placement constraint objects to use for tasks in your service.
You can specify a maximum of 10 constraints per task. This limit includes
constraints in the task definition and those specified at run time. If you
use Fargate, task placement constraints aren't
supported.

When you update a service, this parameter doesn't trigger a new service deployment.

`type`

Type: String

Required: No

The type of constraint. Use `distinctInstance` to
ensure that each task in a particular group is running on a
different container instance. Use `memberOf` to
restrict the selection to a group of valid candidates. The value
`distinctInstance` is not supported in task
definitions.

`expression`

Type: String

Required: No

A cluster query language expression to apply to the
constraint. You can't specify an expression if the constraint
type is `distinctInstance`. For more information, see
[Create expressions to define container instances for Amazon ECS tasks](cluster-query-language.md "cluster-query-language.md").

`placementStrategy`

Type: Array of objects

Required: No

The placement strategy objects to use for tasks in your service. You can
specify a maximum of four strategy rules per service.

When you update a service, this parameter doesn't trigger a new service deployment.

`type`

Type: String

Valid values: `random` | `spread` |
`binpack`

Required: No

The type of placement strategy. The `random`
placement strategy randomly places tasks on available
candidates. The `spread` placement strategy spreads
placement across available candidates evenly based on the
`field` parameter. The `binpack`
strategy places tasks on available candidates that have the
least available amount of the resource that's specified with the
`field` parameter. For example, if you binpack on
memory, a task is placed on the instance with the least amount
of remaining memory but still enough to run the task.

`field`

Type: String

Required: No

The field to apply the placement strategy against. For the
`spread` placement strategy, valid values are
`instanceId` (or `host`, which has the
same effect), or any platform or custom attribute that's applied
to a container instance, such as
`attribute:ecs.availability-zone`. For the
`binpack` placement strategy, valid values are
`cpu` and `memory`. For the
`random` placement strategy, this field is not
used.

## Tags

`tags`

Type: Array of objects

Required: No

The metadata that you apply to the service
to help you categorize and organize them. Each tag consists of a key and
an optional value, both of which you define. When a service is deleted,
the tags are deleted as well. A maximum of 50 tags can be applied to the service.
For more information, see [Tagging Amazon ECS resources](ecs-using-tags.md "ecs-using-tags.md").

When you update a service, this parameter doesn't trigger a new service deployment.

`key`

Type: String

Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1. Maximum length of 128.

Required: No

One part of a key-value pair that make up a tag. A key is a
general label that acts like a category for more specific tag
values.

`value`

Type: String

Length Constraints: Minimum length of 0. Maximum length of 256.

Required: No

The optional part of a key-value pair that make up a tag. A value
acts as a descriptor within a tag category (key).

`enableECSManagedTags`

Type: Boolean

Valid values: `true` | `false`

Required: No

Specifies whether to use Amazon ECS managed tags for the tasks in the service.
If no value is specified, the default value is `false`. For more
information, see [Use tags for billing](ecs-using-tags.md#tag-resources-for-billing "ecs-using-tags.md#tag-resources-for-billing").

When you update a service, this parameter doesn't trigger a new service deployment.

`propagateTags`

Type: String

Valid values: `TASK_DEFINITION` | `SERVICE`

Required: No

Specifies whether to copy the tags
from the task definition or the service to the tasks in the service. If
no value is specified, the tags are not copied. Tags can only be copied
to the tasks within the service during service creation. To add tags to
a task after service creation or task creation, use the `TagResource` API
action.

When you update a service, this parameter doesn't trigger a new service deployment.

## Network configuration

`networkConfiguration`

Type: Object

Required: No

The network configuration for the service. This parameter is required for
task definitions that use the `awsvpc` network mode to receive
their own Elastic Network Interface, and it isn't supported for other
network modes. If using Fargate, the
`awsvpc` network mode is required. For more information about
networking for EC2, see [Amazon ECS task networking options for EC2](task-networking.md "task-networking.md"). For more information about networking
for Fargate, see [Amazon ECS
task networking options for Fargate](fargate-task-networking.md "fargate-task-networking.md").

When you update a service, this parameter triggers a new service deployment.

`awsvpcConfiguration`

Type: Object

Required: No

An object representing the subnets and security groups for a
task or service.

`subnets`

Type: Array of strings

Required: Yes

The subnets that are associated with the task or
service. There is a limit of 16 subnets that can be
specified according to
`awsvpcConfiguration`.

`securityGroups`

Type: Array of strings

Required: No

The security groups associated with the task or
service. If you don't specify a security group, the
default security group for the VPC is used. There's
a limit of five security groups that can be
specified based on
`awsvpcConfiguration`.

`assignPublicIP`

Type: String

Valid values: `ENABLED` |
`DISABLED`

Required: No

Whether the task's elastic network interface
receives a public IP address. If no value is
specified, the default value of
`DISABLED` is used.

`healthCheckGracePeriodSeconds`

Type: Integer

Required: No

The period of time, in seconds, that the Amazon ECS service scheduler ignores unhealthy Elastic Load Balancing, VPC Lattice, and container health checks after a task has first started. If you do not specify a health check grace period value, the default value of 0 is used. If you do not use any of the health checks, then `healthCheckGracePeriodSeconds` is unused.

If your service's tasks take a while to start and respond, you can
specify a health check grace period of up to 2,147,483,647 seconds (about 69
years). During that time, the Amazon ECS service scheduler ignores the health
check status. This grace period can prevent the service scheduler from
marking tasks as unhealthy and stopping them before they have time to come
up.

When you update a service, this parameter doesn't trigger a new service deployment.

`loadBalancers`

Type: Array of objects

Required: No

A load balancer object representing the load balancers to use with your
service. For services that use an Application Load Balancer or Network Load Balancer, there's a limit of five
target groups that you can attach to a service.

When you update a service, this parameter triggers a new service deployment.

After you create a service, the load balancer configuration can't be changed from the AWS Management Console. You can use the AWS Copilot, AWS CloudFormation, AWS CLI or SDK to modify the load balancer configuration for the `ECS` rolling deployment controller only, not AWS CodeDeploy blue/green or external. When you add, update, or remove a load balancer configuration, Amazon ECS starts a new deployment with the updated Elastic Load Balancing configuration. This causes tasks to register to and deregister from load balancers. We recommend that you verify this on a test environment before you update the Elastic Load Balancing configuration. For information about how to modify the configuration, see [UpdateService](../APIReference/API_UpdateService.md "../APIReference/API_UpdateService.md") in the _Amazon Elastic Container Service API Reference_.

For Application Load Balancers and Network Load Balancers, this object must contain the load balancer target
group ARN, the container name (as it appears in a container definition), and
the container port to access from the load balancer. When a task from this
service is placed on a container instance, the container instance and port
combination is registered as a target in the target group specified.

`targetGroupArn`

Type: String

Required: No

The full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Elastic Load Balancing target
group that's associated with a service.

A target group ARN is only specified when using an Application Load Balancer or
Network Load Balancer.

`loadBalancerName`

Type: String

Required: No

The name of the load balancer to associate with the
service.

If you're using an Application Load Balancer or a Network Load Balancer, omit the load balancer
name parameter.

`containerName`

Type: String

Required: No

The name of the container (as it appears in a container
definition) to associate with the load balancer.

`containerPort`

Type: Integer

Required: No

The port on the container to associate with the load balancer.
This port must correspond to a `containerPort` in the
task definition used by tasks in the service. For tasks that use
EC2, the container instance must
allow inbound traffic on the `hostPort` of the port
mapping.

`role`

Type: String

Required: No

The short name or full ARN of the IAM role that allows Amazon ECS to make calls
to your load balancer on your behalf. This parameter is only permitted if you
are using a load balancer with a single target group for your service, and your task definition does not
use the `awsvpc` network mode. If you specify the `role`
parameter, you must also specify a load balancer object with the
`loadBalancers` parameter.

When you update a service, this parameter doesn't trigger a new service deployment.

If your specified role has a path other than `/`, then you must
either specify the full role ARN (this is recommended) or prefix the role name
with the path. For example, if a role with the name `bar` has a path
of `/foo/` then you would specify `/foo/bar` as the role
name. For more information, see [Friendly Names and Paths](../../../IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_identifiers.md#identifiers-friendly-names "../../../IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_identifiers.md#identifiers-friendly-names") in the
_IAM User Guide_.

###### Important

If your account has already created the Amazon ECS service-linked role, that
role is used by default for your service unless you specify a role here. The
service-linked role is required if your task definition uses the awsvpc
network mode, in which case you should not specify a role here. For more
information, see [Using service-linked roles for
Amazon ECS](using-service-linked-roles.md "using-service-linked-roles.md").

`serviceConnectConfiguration`

Type: Object

Required: No

The configuration for this service to discover and connect to services,
and be discovered by, and connected from, other services within a
namespace.

When you update a service, this parameter triggers a new service deployment.

For more information, see [Use Service Connect to connect Amazon ECS services with short
names](service-connect.md "service-connect.md").

`enabled`

Type: Boolean

Required: Yes

Specifies whether to use Service Connect with this service.

`namespace`

Type: String

Required: No

The short name or full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the AWS Cloud Map namespace for
use with Service Connect. The namespace must be in the same
AWS Region as the Amazon ECS service and cluster. The type of
namespace doesn't affect Service Connect. For more information
about AWS Cloud Map, see [Working
with Services](../../../cloud-map/latest/dg/working-with-services.md "../../../cloud-map/latest/dg/working-with-services.md") in the
_AWS Cloud Map Developer Guide_.

`services`

Type: Array of objects

Required: No

An array of Service Connect service objects. These are names
and aliases (also known as endpoints) that are used by other
Amazon ECS services to connect to this
service.

This field isn't required for a "client" Amazon ECS service that's
a member of a namespace only to connect to other services within
the namespace. An example is frontend application that accepts
incoming requests from either a load balancer that's attached to
the service or by other means.

An object selects a port from the task definition, assigns a
name for the AWS Cloud Map service, and an array of aliases (also known
as endpoints) and ports for client applications to refer to this
service.

`portName`

Type: String

Required: Yes

The `portName` must match the
`name` of one of the
`portMappings` from all of the
containers in the task definition of this Amazon ECS
service.

`discoveryName`

Type: String

Required: No

The `discoveryName` is the name of the
new AWS Cloud Map service that Amazon ECS creates for this Amazon ECS
service. This must be unique within the AWS Cloud Map
namespace.

If this field isn't specified,
`portName` is used.

`clientAliases`

Type: Array of objects

Required: No

The list of client aliases for this service
connect service. You use these to assign names that
can be used by client applications. The maximum
number of client aliases that you can have in this
list is 1.

Each alias ("endpoint") is a DNS name and port
number that other Amazon ECS services ("clients") can use
to connect to this service.

Each name and port combination must be unique
within the namespace.

These names are configured within each task of the
client service, not in AWS Cloud Map. DNS requests to
resolve these names don't leave the task, and don't
count toward the quota of DNS requests per second
per elastic network interface.

`port`

Type: Integer

Required: Yes

The listening port number for the service
connect proxy. This port is available inside of
all of the tasks within the same namespace.

To avoid changing your applications in
client Amazon ECS services, set this to the same port
that the client application uses by
default.

`dnsName`

Type: String

Required: No

The `dnsName` is the name that
you use in the applications of client tasks to
connect to this service. The name must be a valid
DNS label.

The default value is the
`discoveryName.namespace` if this field
is not specified. If the
`discoveryName` isn't specified, the
`portName` from the task definition is
used.

To avoid changing your applications in
client Amazon ECS services, set this to the same name
that the client application uses by default. For
example, a few common names are
`database`, `db`, or the
lowercase name of a database, such as
`mysql` or `redis`.

`ingressPortOverride`

Type: Integer

Required: No

(Optional) The port number for the
Service Connect proxy to listen on.

Use the value of this field to bypass the proxy
for traffic on the port number that's specified in
the named `portMapping` in the task
definition of this application, and then use it in
your Amazon VPC security groups to allow traffic into the
proxy for this Amazon ECS service.

In `awsvpc` mode, the default value is
the container port number that's specified in the
named `portMapping` in the task
definition of this application. In
`bridge` mode, the default value is the
dynamic ephemeral port of the Service Connect
proxy.

`logConfiguration`

Type: [LogConfiguration](../APIReference/API_LogConfiguration.md "../APIReference/API_LogConfiguration.md") Object

Required: No

This defines where the Service Connect proxy logs
are published. Use the logs for debugging during
unexpected events. This configuration sets the
`logConfiguration` parameter in the
Service Connect proxy container in each task in
this Amazon ECS service. The proxy container isn't
specified in the task definition.

We recommend that you use the same log
configuration as the application containers of the
task definition for this Amazon ECS service. For
FireLens, this is the log configuration of the
application container. It's not the FireLens log
router container that uses the
`fluent-bit` or `fluentd`
container image.

`serviceRegistries`

Type: Array of objects

Required: No

The details of the service discovery configuration for your service. For
more information, see [Use service discovery to connect Amazon ECS services with
DNS names](service-discovery.md "service-discovery.md").

When you update a service, this parameter triggers a new service deployment.

`registryArn`

Type: String

Required: No

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN)of the service registry. The
currently supported service registry is AWS Cloud Map. For more
information, see [Working
with Services](../../../cloud-map/latest/dg/working-with-services.md "../../../cloud-map/latest/dg/working-with-services.md") in the
_AWS Cloud Map Developer Guide_.

`port`

Type: Integer

Required: No

The port value that's used if your service discovery service
specified an SRV record. This field is required if both the
`awsvpc` network mode and SRV records are
used.

`containerName`

Type: String

Required: No

The container name value to be used for your service discovery
service. This value is specified in the task definition. If the
task definition that your service task specifies uses the
`bridge` or `host` network mode, you
must specify a `containerName` and
`containerPort` combination from the task
definition. If the task definition that your service task
specifies uses the `awsvpc` network mode and a type
SRV DNS record is used, you must specify either a
`containerName` and `containerPort`
combination or a `port` value, but not both.

`containerPort`

Type: Integer

Required: No

The port value to be used for your service discovery service.
This value is specified in the task definition. If the task
definition your service task specifies uses the
`bridge` or `host` network mode, you
must specify a `containerName` and
`containerPort` combination from the task
definition. If the task definition your service task specifies
uses the `awsvpc` network mode and a type SRV DNS
record is used, you must specify either a
`containerName` and `containerPort`
combination or a `port` value, but not both.

## Client token

`clientToken`

Type: String

Required: No

The unique, case-sensitive identifier that you provide to ensure the
idempotency of the request. It can be up to 32 ASCII characters long.

## Availability Zone rebalancing

`availabilityZoneRebalancing`

Type: String

Required: No

Indicates whether the service uses Availability Zone rebalancing. The valid values
are `ENABLED` and `DISABLED`.

When you update a service, this parameter doesn't trigger a new service deployment.

Default behavior:

- For new services : If no value is specified, the default is
  `DISABLED`.
- For existing services : If no value is specified, Amazon ECS defaults
  the value to to the existing value. If no value was previously set,
  Amazon ECS sets the value to `DISABLED`.

For more information about Availability Zone rebalancing, see [Balancing an Amazon ECS service across Availability
Zones](service-rebalancing.md "service-rebalancing.md").

## Volume configurations

`volumeConfigurations`

Type: Object

Required: No

The configuration that will be used to create volumes for tasks that are
managed by the service. Only volumes that are marked as
`configuredAtLaunch` in the task definition can be configured
by using this object.

When you update a service, this parameter triggers a new service deployment.

This object is required for attaching Amazon EBS volumes to tasks that are
managed by a service. For more information, see [Use Amazon EBS volumes with Amazon ECS](ebs-volumes.md "ebs-volumes.md").

`name`

Type: String

Required: Yes

The name of a volume that's configured when creating or
updating a service. Up to 255 letters (uppercase and lowercase),
numbers, underscores (`_`), and hyphens
(`-`) are allowed. This value must match the
volume name that's specified in the task definition.

`managedEBSVolume`

Type: Object

Required: No

The volume configuration used for creating Amazon EBS volumes that
are attached to tasks that are maintained by a service when the
service is created or updated. One volume is attached per
task.

`encrypted`

Type: Boolean

Required: No

Valid values:
`true`|`false`

Specifies whether to encrypt each created Amazon EBS
volume. If you've turned on Amazon EBS encryption by
default for a particular AWS Region for your
AWS account but set this parameter to `false`, this parameter will be overridden, and
the volumes will be encrypted with the KMS key specified for encryption by default. For more information
about Amazon EBS encryption by default, see [Enable Amazon EBS encryption by default](../../../ebs/latest/userguide/encryption-by-default.md "../../../ebs/latest/userguide/encryption-by-default.md") in the
_Amazon EBS User
Guide_. For more information about encrypting Amazon EBS volumes attached to Amazon ECS tasks, see [Encrypt data stored in Amazon EBS volumes attached to
Amazon ECS tasks](ebs-kms-encryption.md "ebs-kms-encryption.md").

`kmsKeyId`

Type: String

Required: No

The identifier of the AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) key to use
for Amazon EBS encryption. If `kmsKeyId` is specified, the encrypted
state must be `true`.

The key specified using this parameter overrides the Amazon EBS default or any cluster-level KMS key for Amazon ECS managed storage encryption that you may have specified. For more information, see [Encrypt data stored in Amazon EBS volumes attached to
Amazon ECS tasks](ebs-kms-encryption.md "ebs-kms-encryption.md").

You can specify the KMS key by using any of the
following:

- **Key ID**
  – For example,
  `1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab`.
- **Key alias**
  – For example,
  `alias/ExampleAlias`.
- **Key ARN**
  – For example,
  `arn:aws:kms:us-east-1:012345678910:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab`.
- **Alias ARN**
  – For example,
  `arn:aws:kms:us-east-1:012345678910:alias/ExampleAlias`.

###### Important

AWS authenticates the KMS key
asynchronously. Therefore, if you specify an ID,
alias, or ARN that isn't valid, the action can
appear to succeed, but it eventually fails. For
more information, see [Troubleshooting Amazon EBS volume attachment
issues](troubleshoot-ebs-volumes.md "troubleshoot-ebs-volumes.md").

`volumeType`

Type: String

Required: No

Valid values:
`gp2`|`gp3`|`io1`|`io2`|`sc1`|`st1`|`standard`

The Amazon EBS volume type. For more information about
volume types, see [Amazon EBS volume types](../../../ebs/latest/userguide/ebs-volume-types.md "../../../ebs/latest/userguide/ebs-volume-types.md") in the _Amazon EBS
User Guide_. The default volume type is
`gp3`.

###### Note

The `standard` volume type is not
supported for Fargate tasks.

`sizeInGiB`

Type: Integer

Required: No

Valid range: Integers between 1 and 16,384

The size of the EBS volume in gibibytes (GiB). If
you do not provide a snapshot ID to configure a
volume for attachment, you must provide a size
value. If you configure a volume for attachment by
using a snapshot, the default value is the snapshot
size. You can then specify a size greater than or
equal to the snapshot size.

For `gp2` and `gp3` volume
types, the valid range is 1-16,384.

For `io1` and `io2` volume
types, the valid range is 4-16,384.

For `st1` and `sc1` volume
types, the valid range is 125-16,384.

For the `standard` volume type, the
valid range is 1-1,024.

`snapshotId`

Type: String

Required: No

The ID of the snapshot of an existing Amazon EBS volume
that Amazon ECS uses to create new volumes for
attachment. You must specify either a
`snapshotId` or a
`sizeInGiB`.

`volumeInitializationRate`

Type: Integer

Required: No

The rate, in MiB/s, at which data is fetched from
a snapshot of an existing Amazon EBS volume to create new
volumes for attachment. This property can be
specified only if you specify a
`snapshotId`. For more information
about this volume initialization rate, including the
range of supported rates for initialization, see
[Initialize Amazon EBS volumes](../../../ebs/latest/userguide/initalize-volume.md "../../../ebs/latest/userguide/initalize-volume.md") in the _Amazon EBS User
Guide_.

`iops`

Type: Integer

Required: No

The number of I/O operations per second (IOPS).
For `gp3`, `io1`, and
`io2` volumes, this represents the
number of IOPS that are provisioned for the volume.
For `gp2` volumes, this value represents
the baseline performance of the volume and the rate
at which the volume accumulates I/O credits for
bursting. This parameter is required for
`io1` and `io2` volumes.
This parameter is not supported for
`gp2`, `st1`,`sc1`,
or `standard` volumes.

For `gp3` volumes, the valid range of
values is 3,000 to 16,000.

For `io1` volumes, the valid range of
values is 100 to 64,000.

For `io2` volumes, the valid range of
values is 100 to 64,000.

`throughput`

Type: Integer

Required: No

The throughput to provision for the volumes that
are attached to tasks that are maintained by a
service.

###### Important

This parameter is supported only for
`gp3` volumes.

`roleArn`

Type: String

Required: Yes

The Amazon Resource ARN (ARN) of the
infrastructure AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that provides
Amazon ECS permissions to manage Amazon EBS resources for your
tasks. For more information, see [Amazon ECS infrastructure IAM role](infrastructure_IAM_role.md "infrastructure_IAM_role.md").

`tagSpecifications`

Type: Object

Required: No

The specification for tags to be applied to each
Amazon EBS volume.

`resourceType`

Type: String

Required: Yes

Valid values: `volume`

The type of resource to tag on
creation.

`tags`

Type: Array of objects

Required: No

The metadata that you apply to volumes to
help you categorize and organize them. Each tag
consists of a key and an optional value, both of
which you define. `AmazonECSCreated`
and `AmazonECSManaged` are reserved
tags that are added by Amazon ECS on your behalf, so
you can specify a maximum of 48 tags of your own.
When a volume is deleted, the tags are deleted as
well. For more information, see [Tagging Amazon ECS resources](ecs-using-tags.md "ecs-using-tags.md").

`key`

Type: String

Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1.
Maximum length of 128.

Required: No

One part of a key-value pair that makes up a
tag. A key is a general label that acts like a
category for more specific tag values.

`value`

Type: String

Length Constraints: Minimum length of 0.
Maximum length of 256.

Required: No

The optional part of a key-value pair that
makes up a tag. A value acts as a descriptor
within a tag category (key).

`propagateTags`

Type: String

Valid values: `TASK_DEFINITION` |
`SERVICE` | `NONE`

Required: No

Specifies whether to copy the tags from the
task definition or the service to a volume. If
`NONE` is specified or no value is
specified, the tags aren't copied.

`fileSystemType`

Type: String

Required: No

Valid values:
`xfs`|`ext3`|`ext4`|`NTFS`

The type of file system on a volume. The volume's
file system type determines how data is stored and
retrieved in the volume. For volumes created from a
snapshot, you must specify the same filesystem type
that the volume was using when the snapshot was
created. If there is a filesystem type mismatch, the
task will fail to start.

The valid values for Linux are `xfs`,
ext3`, and ext4`. The default for
volumes that are attached to Linux tasks is
`XFS`.

The valid values for Windows are
`NTFS`. The default for volumes that are
attached to Windows tasks is
`NTFS`.
