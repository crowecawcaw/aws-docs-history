# Restart individual containers in Amazon ECS tasks with

container restart policies

You can enable a restart policy for each essential and non-essential container defined in
your task definition, to overcome transient failures faster and maintain task availability.
When you enable a restart policy for a container, Amazon ECS can restart the container if it
exits, without needing to replace the task.

Restart policies are not enabled for containers by default. When you enable a restart
policy for a container, you can specify exit codes that the container will not be restarted
on. These can be exit codes that indicate success, like exit code `0`, that don't
require a restart. You can also specify how long a container must run succesfully before a
restart can be attempted. For more information about these parameters, see [Restart policy](task_definition_parameters.md#container_definition_restart_policy "task_definition_parameters.md#container_definition_restart_policy"). For an example task definition
that specifies these values, see [Specifying a container
restart policy in an Amazon ECS task definition](container-restart-policy-example.md "container-restart-policy-example.md").

You can use the Amazon ECS task metadata endpoint or CloudWatch Container Insights to monitor the number of times
a container has restarted. For more information about the task metadata endpoint, see [Amazon ECS task metadata endpoint version 4](task-metadata-endpoint-v4.md "task-metadata-endpoint-v4.md") and
[Amazon ECS task metadata endpoint version 4 for
tasks on Fargate](task-metadata-endpoint-v4-fargate.md "task-metadata-endpoint-v4-fargate.md"). For more information about Container Insights
metrics for Amazon ECS, see [Amazon ECS
Container Insights metrics](../../../AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/Container-Insights-metrics-ECS.md "../../../AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/Container-Insights-metrics-ECS.md") in the _Amazon CloudWatch User
Guide_.

Container restart policies are supported by tasks hosted on Fargate, Amazon EC2 instances,
and external instances using Amazon ECS Anywhere.

## Considerations

Consider the following before enabling a restart policy for your container:

- Restart policies aren't supported for Windows containers on Fargate.
- For tasks hosted on Amazon EC2 instances, this feature requires version
  `1.86.0` or later of the container agent. However, we recommend
  using the latest container agent version. For information about how to check
  your agent version and update to the latest version, see [Updating the Amazon ECS container agent](ecs-agent-update.md "ecs-agent-update.md").
- For tasks hosted on Fargate, this feature requires platform version
  `1.4.0` or later. For information, see [Fargate platform versions for Amazon ECS](platform-fargate.md "platform-fargate.md").
- If you're using EC2 with the `bridge`
  network mode, the `FLUENT_HOST` environment variable in your
  application container can become inaccurate after a restart of the FireLens log
  router container (the container with the `firelensConfiguration` object in its
  container definition). This is because `FLUENT_HOST` is a dynamic IP
  address and can change after a restart. Logging directly from the application container to the
  `FLUENT_HOST` IP address can start failing after the address changes. For
  more information about `FLUENT_HOST`, see [Configuring Amazon ECS logs for high
  throughput](firelens-docker-buffer-limit.md "firelens-docker-buffer-limit.md").
- The Amazon ECS agent handles the container restart policies. If for some unexpected
  reason the Amazon ECS agent fails or is no longer running, the container won't be
  restarted.
- The restart attempt period defined in your policy determines the period of
  time (in seconds) that the container must run for before Amazon ECS restarts a
  container.
