# How CloudWatch alarms detect Amazon ECS deployment

failures

You can configure Amazon ECS to set the deployment to failed when it detects that a
specified CloudWatch alarm has gone into the `ALARM` state.

You can optionally set the configuration to roll back a failed deployment to the last
completed deployment.

The following `create-service` AWS CLI example shows how to create a Linux
service when the deployment alarms are used with the rollback option.

```
`aws ecs create-service \
 --service-name `MyService` \
 --deployment-controller type=`ECS` \
 --desired-count `3` \
 --deployment-configuration "alarms={alarmNames=[`alarm1Name`,`alarm2Name`],enable=`true`,rollback=`true`}" \
 --task-definition `sample-fargate:1` \
 --launch-type `FARGATE` \
 --platform-family `LINUX` \
 --platform-version `1.4.0` \
 --network-configuration "awsvpcConfiguration={subnets=[`subnet-12344321`],securityGroups=[`sg-12344321`],assignPublicIp=`ENABLED`}"`
```

Consider the following when you use the Amazon CloudWatch alarms method on a service.

- The duration when both blue and green service revisions are running simultaneously after the production traffic has shifted. Amazon ECS computes this time
  period based on the alarm configuration associated with the deployment. You
  can't set this value.
- The `deploymentConfiguration` request parameter now contains the
  `alarms` data type. You can specify the alarm names, whether to
  use the method, and whether to initiate a rollback when the alarms indicate a
  deployment failure. For more information, see [CreateService](../APIReference/API_CreateService.md "../APIReference/API_CreateService.md") in the _Amazon Elastic Container Service API Reference_.
- The `DescribeServices` response provides insight into the state of
  a deployment, the `rolloutState` and `rolloutStateReason`.
  When a new deployment starts, the rollout state begins in an
  `IN_PROGRESS` state. When the service reaches a steady state and
  the bake time is complete, the rollout state transitions to
  `COMPLETED`. If the service fails to reach a steady state and the
  alarm has gone into the `ALARM` state, the deployment will transition
  to a `FAILED` state. A deployment in a `FAILED` state
  won't launch any new tasks.
- In addition to the service deployment state change events Amazon ECS sends for
  deployments that have started and have completed, Amazon ECS also sends an event when
  a deployment that uses alarms fails. These events provide details about why a
  deployment failed or if a deployment was started because of a rollback. For more
  information, see [Amazon ECS service deployment state change
  events](ecs_service_deployment_events.md "ecs_service_deployment_events.md").
- If a new deployment is started because a previous deployment failed and
  rollback was turned on, the `reason` field of the service deployment
  state change event will indicate the deployment was started because of a
  rollback.
- If you use the deployment circuit breaker and the Amazon CloudWatch alarms to detect
  failures, either one can initiate a deployment failure as soon as the criteria
  for either method is met. A rollback occurs when you use the rollback option for
  the method that initiated the deployment failure.
- The Amazon CloudWatch alarms is only supported for Amazon ECS services that use the rolling
  update (`ECS`) deployment controller.
- You can configure this option by using the Amazon ECS console, or the AWS CLI. For
  more information, see [Create a service using defined
  parameters](create-service-console-v2.md#create-custom-service "create-service-console-v2.md#create-custom-service") and [create-service](../../../cli/latest/reference/ecs/create-service.md "../../../cli/latest/reference/ecs/create-service.md") in the _AWS Command Line Interface
  Reference_.
- You might notice that the deployment status remains `IN_PROGRESS`
  for a prolonged amount of time. The reason for this is that Amazon ECS does not
  change the status until it has deleted the active deployment, and this does not
  happen until after the bake time. Depending on your alarm configuration, the
  deployment might appear to take several minutes longer than it does when you
  don't use alarms (even though the new primary task set is scaled up and the old
  deployment is scaled down). If you use CloudFormation timeouts, consider increasing
  the timeouts. For more information, see [Creating wait conditions in a template](../../../AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/using-cfn-waitcondition.md "../../../AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/using-cfn-waitcondition.md") in the _AWS CloudFormation User Guide_.
- Amazon ECS calls `DescribeAlarms` to poll the alarms. The calls to
  `DescribeAlarms` count toward the CloudWatch service quotas associated
  with your account. If you have other AWS services that call
  `DescribeAlarms`, there might be an impact on Amazon ECS to poll the
  alarms. For example, if another service makes enough `DescribeAlarms`
  calls to reach the quota, that service is throttled and Amazon ECS is also throttled
  and unable to poll alarms. If an alarm is generated during the throttling
  period, Amazon ECS might miss the alarm and the roll back might not occur. There is
  no other impact on the deployment. For more information on CloudWatch service quotas,
  see [CloudWatch service
  quotas](../../../AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/cloudwatch_limits.md "../../../AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/cloudwatch_limits.md") in the _CloudWatch User
  Guide_.
- If an alarm is in the `ALARM` state at the beginning of a
  deployment, Amazon ECS will not monitor alarms for the duration of that deployment
  (Amazon ECS ignores the alarm configuration). This behavior addresses the case where
  you want to start a new deployment to fix an initial deployment failure.

## Recommended alarms

We recommend that you use the following alarm metrics:

- If you use an Application Load Balancer, use the `HTTPCode_ELB_5XX_Count` and
  `HTTPCode_ELB_4XX_Count` Application Load Balancer metrics. These metrics check
  for HTTP spikes. For more information about the Application Load Balancer metrics, see [CloudWatch metrics for your Application Load Balancer](../../../elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/load-balancer-cloudwatch-metrics.md "../../../elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/load-balancer-cloudwatch-metrics.md") in the _User Guide for Application Load Balancers_.
- If you have an existing application, use the `CPUUtilization`
  and `MemoryUtilization` metrics. These metrics check for the
  percentage of CPU and memory that the cluster or service uses. For more
  information, see [Considerations](cloudwatch-metrics.md#enable_cloudwatch "cloudwatch-metrics.md#enable_cloudwatch").
- If you use Amazon Simple Queue Service queues in your tasks, use
  `ApproximateNumberOfMessagesNotVisible` Amazon SQS metric. This
  metric checks for number of messages in the queue that are delayed and not
  available for reading immediately. For more information about Amazon SQS metrics,
  see [Available CloudWatch metrics for Amazon SQS](../../../AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-available-cloudwatch-metrics.md "../../../AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-available-cloudwatch-metrics.md") in the _Amazon Simple Queue Service Developer Guide_.

## Bake time

When you use the rollback option for your service deployments, Amazon ECS waits an additional amount of time after the target service revision has been deployed before it sends a CloudWatch alarm. This is referred to as the bake time. This time starts after:

- All tasks for a target service revision are running and in a healthy state
- Source service revisions are scaled down to 0%

The default bake time is less than 5 minutes. The service deployment is marked as complete after the bake time expires.

You can configure the bake time for a rolling deployment. When you use CloudWatch alarms to detect failure, if you change the bake time, and then decide you want the Amazon ECS default, you must manually set the bake time.
