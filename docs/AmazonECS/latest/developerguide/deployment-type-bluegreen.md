# CodeDeploy blue/green deployments for Amazon ECS

We recommend that you use the Amazon ECS blue/green deployment. For more information, see [Creating an Amazon ECS blue/green deployment](deploy-blue-green-service.md "deploy-blue-green-service.md") .

The _blue/green_ deployment type uses the blue/green deployment
model controlled by CodeDeploy. Use this deployment type to verify a new deployment of a
service before sending production traffic to it. For more information, see [What Is CodeDeploy](../../../codedeploy/latest/userguide/welcome.md "../../../codedeploy/latest/userguide/welcome.md") in the
_AWS CodeDeploy User Guide_.Validate the state of an Amazon ECS service
before deployment

There are three ways traffic can shift during a blue/green deployment:

- **Canary** — Traffic is shifted in two
  increments. You can choose from predeﬁned canary options that specify the
  percentage of traﬃc shifted to your updated task set in the ﬁrst increment
  and the interval, in minutes, before the remaining traﬃc is shifted in the
  second increment.
- **Linear** — Traffic is shifted in
  equal increments with an equal number of minutes between each increment. You
  can choose from predeﬁned linear options that specify the percentage of
  traﬃc shifted in each increment and the number of minutes between each
  increment.
- **All-at-once** — All traffic is
  shifted from the original task set to the updated task set all at
  once.
  The following are components of CodeDeploy that Amazon ECS uses when a service uses the
  blue/green deployment type:

**CodeDeploy application**

A collection of CodeDeploy resources. This consists of one or more
deployment groups.

**CodeDeploy deployment group**

The deployment settings. This consists of the following:

- Amazon ECS cluster and service
- Load balancer target group and listener information
- Deployment roll back strategy
- Traffic rerouting settings
- Original revision termination settings
- Deployment configuration
- CloudWatch alarms configuration that can be set up to stop
  deployments
- SNS or CloudWatch Events settings for notifications

For more information, see [Working with Deployment
Groups](../../../codedeploy/latest/userguide/deployment-groups.md "../../../codedeploy/latest/userguide/deployment-groups.md") in the _AWS CodeDeploy User Guide_.

**CodeDeploy deployment configuration**

Specifies how CodeDeploy routes production traffic to your replacement task
set during a deployment. The following pre-defined linear and canary
deployment configuration are available. You can also create custom
defined linear and canary deployments as well. For more information, see
[Working
with Deployment Configurations](../../../codedeploy/latest/userguide/deployment-configurations.md "../../../codedeploy/latest/userguide/deployment-configurations.md") in the
_AWS CodeDeploy User Guide_.

- **CodeDeployDefault.ECSAllAtOnce**: Shifts all traffic to the
  updated Amazon ECS container at once
- **CodeDeployDefault.ECSLinear10PercentEvery1Minutes**: Shifts
  10 percent of traffic every minute until all traffic is shifted.
- **CodeDeployDefault.ECSLinear10PercentEvery3Minutes**: Shifts
  10 percent of traffic every 3 minutes until all traffic is shifted.
- **CodeDeployDefault.ECSCanary10Percent5Minutes**: Shifts 10
  percent of traffic in the first increment. The remaining 90 percent is deployed
  five minutes later.
- **CodeDeployDefault.ECSCanary10Percent15Minutes**: Shifts 10
  percent of traffic in the first increment. The remaining 90 percent is deployed 15
  minutes later.

**Revision**

A revision is the CodeDeploy application specification file (AppSpec file).
In the AppSpec file, you specify the full ARN of the task definition and
the container and port of your replacement task set where traffic is to
be routed when a new deployment is created. The container name must be
one of the container names referenced in your task definition. If the
network configuration or platform version has been updated in the
service definition, you must also specify those details in the AppSpec
file. You can also specify the Lambda functions to run during the
deployment lifecycle events. The Lambda functions allow you to run tests
and return metrics during the deployment. For more information, see
[AppSpec File
Reference](../../../codedeploy/latest/userguide/reference-appspec-file.md "../../../codedeploy/latest/userguide/reference-appspec-file.md") in the
_AWS CodeDeploy User Guide_.

## Considerations

Consider the following when using the blue/green deployment type:

- When an Amazon ECS service using the blue/green deployment type is
  initially created, an Amazon ECS task set is created.
- You must configure the service to use either an Application Load Balancer or Network Load Balancer. The
  following are the load balancer requirements:
  - You must add a production listener to the load balancer, which
    is used to route production traffic.
  - An optional test listener can be added to the load balancer,
    which is used to route test traffic. If you specify a test
    listener, CodeDeploy routes your test traffic to the replacement task
    set during a deployment.
  - Both the production and test listeners must belong to the same
    load balancer.
  - You must define a target group for the load balancer. The
    target group routes traffic to the original task set in a
    service through the production listener.
  - When a Network Load Balancer is used, only the
    `CodeDeployDefault.ECSAllAtOnce` deployment
    configuration is supported.

- For services configured to use service auto scaling and the blue/green
  deployment type, auto scaling is not blocked during a deployment but the
  deployment may fail under some circumstances. The following describes
  this behavior in more detail.
  - If a service is scaling and a deployment starts, the green
    task set is created and CodeDeploy will wait up to an hour for the
    green task set to reach steady state and won't shift any traffic
    until it does.
  - If a service is in the process of a blue/green deployment and
    a scaling event occurs, traffic will continue to shift for 5
    minutes. If the service doesn't reach steady state within 5
    minutes, CodeDeploy will stop the deployment and mark it as
    failed.

- Tasks using Fargate or the
  `CODE_DEPLOY` deployment controller types don't support
  the `DAEMON` scheduling strategy.
- When you initially create a CodeDeploy application and deployment group,
  you must specify the following:
  - You must define two target groups for the load balancer. One
    target group should be the initial target group defined for the
    load balancer when the Amazon ECS service was created. The second
    target group's only requirement is that it can't be associated
    with a different load balancer than the one the service
    uses.

- When you create a CodeDeploy deployment for an Amazon ECS service, CodeDeploy creates
  a _replacement task set_ (or _green task
  set_) in the deployment. If you added a test listener to
  the load balancer, CodeDeploy routes your test traffic to the replacement
  task set. This is when you can run any validation tests. Then CodeDeploy
  reroutes the production traffic from the original task set to the
  replacement task set according to the traffic rerouting settings for the
  deployment group.

## Required IAM

permissions

Blue/green deployments are made possible by a combination of the Amazon ECS and
CodeDeploy APIs. Users must have the appropriate permissions for these services before
they can use Amazon ECS blue/green deployments in the AWS Management Console or with the AWS CLI or
SDKs.

In addition to the standard IAM permissions for creating and updating
services, Amazon ECS requires the following permissions. These permissions have been
added to the `AmazonECS_FullAccess` IAM policy. For more
information, see [AmazonECS_FullAccess](security-iam-awsmanpol.md#security-iam-awsmanpol-AmazonECS_FullAccess "security-iam-awsmanpol.md#security-iam-awsmanpol-AmazonECS_FullAccess").

###### Note

In addition to the standard Amazon ECS permissions required to run tasks and
services, users also require `iam:PassRole` permissions to use
IAM roles for tasks.

CodeDeploy needs permissions to call Amazon ECS APIs, modify your Elastic Load Balancing, invoke Lambda
functions, and describe CloudWatch alarms, as well as permissions to modify your
service's desired count on your behalf. Before creating an Amazon ECS service that
uses the blue/green deployment type, you must create an IAM role
(`ecsCodeDeployRole`). For more information, see [Amazon ECS CodeDeploy IAM Role](codedeploy_IAM_role.md "codedeploy_IAM_role.md").
