# Application Load Balancers

## Using zonal shift for Application Load Balancers

To use Application Load Balancers with zonal shift, you must enable ARC zonal shift integration in the
Application Load Balancer attributes. Application Load Balancer supports zonal shift with cross-zone enabled or
cross-zone disabled configurations.

Before you enable the ARC integration and start using zonal shift, review the following information:

- You can start a zonal shift for a specific load balancer only for a single Availability Zone. You can't
  start a zonal shift for multiple Availability Zones.
- AWS proactively removes zonal load balancer IP addresses from DNS when multiple infrastructure issues
  impact services. Always check current Availability Zone capacity before you start a zonal shift.
- When an Application Load Balancer is a target of a Network Load Balancer, always start the zonal shift from the Network Load Balancer. If you start a
  zonal shift from the Application Load Balancer, the Network Load Balancer doesn't recognize the shift and continues to send traffic to the Application Load Balancer.

You can start a zonal shift for a load balancer in the Elastic Load Balancing console (in most
AWS Regions) or in the ARC console.

Console

###### To enable zonal shift on a load balancer (Console)

1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at
   [https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/ "https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/").
2. On the **Navigation** page, under **Load balancing**, choose **Load balancers**.
3. Select the Application Load Balancer name.
4. On the **Attributes** tab, **Edit**.
5. Under **Availability Zone routing configuration**, for
   > ARC zonal shift integration, choose **Enable**.
6. Choose **Save**.

AWS CLI

###### To enable zonal shift on a load balancer (AWS CLI)

- Enter the following command:

```
aws elbv2 modify-load-balancer-attributes --load-balancer-arn `my-alb-arn` --attributes Key=zonal_shift.config.enabled,Value=true
```

For more information on starting a zonal shift, see [Starting, updating, or canceling a zonal shift](arc-zonal-shift.md "arc-zonal-shift.md").

You can use the `keepalive` option to configure how long connections
continue. For more information, see [HTTP client keepalive duration](../../../elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/application-load-balancers.md#http-client-keep-alive-duration "../../../elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/application-load-balancers.md#http-client-keep-alive-duration") in the Application Load Balancer User Guide. By default,
Application Load Balancers set the HTTP client keepalive duration value to 3600 seconds, or 1 hour. We
suggest that you lower the value to be inline with your recovery time goal for your
application, for example, 300 seconds. When you choose an HTTP client keepalive
duration time, consider that this value is a trade off between reconnecting more
frequently in general, which can affect latency, and more quickly moving all clients
away from an impaired AZ or Region.

## How zonal shift works for Application Load Balancers

When a zonal shift is started on an Application Load Balancer with cross-zone load balancing enabled, all traffic to
targets is blocked in the Availability Zone that is impacted, and the zonal shift removes the zonal IP address from DNS.

For more information, see [Integrations for your Application Load Balancer](../../../elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/load-balancer-integrations.md#zonal-shift "../../../elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/load-balancer-integrations.md#zonal-shift") in the _Application Load Balancer User Guide_.
