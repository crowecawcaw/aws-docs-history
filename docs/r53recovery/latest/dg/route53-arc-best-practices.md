# Best practices for zonal shifts in ARC

We recommend the following best practices for using zonal shifts for multi-AZ recovery in
ARC.

**Capacity planning and pre-scaling**
Ensure that you have planned for, and either pre-scaled or can auto-scale, sufficient capacity
to accommodate the extra load imposed on Availability Zones when you start a zonal shift. With a recovery-oriented
architecture, a typical recommendation is to pre-scale compute capacity to include enough headroom to serve your peak traffic
when one of your (typically) three replicas is offline.

When you start a zonal shift for a supported resource and traffic is shifted away from an
AZ, the capacity that your application was using to service requests is
removed. You must ensure that you have planned for a shift of traffic away
from an AZ and can continue to service requests in the remaining AZs.

**Limit the time that clients stay connected to your endpoints**

When Amazon Application Recovery Controller (ARC) shifts traffic away from an impairment, for example, by using zonal shift or
zonal autoshift, the mechanism that ARC uses to move your application traffic is a DNS update.
A DNS update causes all new connections to be directed away from the impaired location.

However, clients with pre-existing open connections might continue to make requests against the impaired location until
the clients reconnect. To ensure a quick recovery, we recommend that you limit the amount of time clients
stay connected to your endpoints.

**Test starting zonal shifts, in advance**
Regularly test moving traffic away from Availability Zones for your application by starting
zonal shifts. Plan for and execute starting zonal shifts, preferably in both test and production environments, as part of
regular failover testing for recovering your applications in the event of a disaster. Regular
testing is a critical part of ensuring that you're ready for and have the confidence to mitigate
issues when an operational event occurs.

**Ensure that all Availability Zones are healthy and taking traffic**
Zonal shifts work by marking a resource, that is, an application replica, as unhealthy in an
Availability Zone. This means that it's critical to ensure that the
resources in your applications are generally healthy and actively taking
traffic in the Availability Zones in a Region. We recommend that you have
dashboards to track this, including, for example, ELB metrics for
unhealthy targets and bytesProcessed per Availability Zone.

Consider monitoring the health of your resources from a second, adjacent Region.
Advantages of this approach are that it can be more representative of your
end users' experience, and it also reduces the risk of both your application
and your monitoring being impacted by the same disaster at the same
time.

**Use data plane API operations for disaster recovery**
For starting a zonal shift when you need to recover an application quickly, with few dependencies, we recommend
using the AWS Command Line Interface or API with zonal shift actions, with pre-stored credentials, if possible. You can also start
zonal shifts in the AWS Management Console, for ease of use. But when fast, reliable recovery is critical, data plane operations
are a better choice. For more information, see [Zonal Shift API Reference Guide](../../../arc-zonal-shift/latest/api/Welcome.md "../../../arc-zonal-shift/latest/api/Welcome.md").

**Move traffic with a zonal shift only temporarily**
A zonal shift moves traffic away from an Availability Zone on a temporary basis, to mitigate an
impairment. You should restore the resource for the application to service as soon as you've taken action to correct
a problem. This ensures that your overall application is restored to its original fully redundant, resilient state.
