# Best practices when you configure zonal autoshift

Be aware of the following best practices and considerations when you enable zonal autoshift in Amazon Application Recovery Controller (ARC).

Zonal autoshift includes two types of traffic shifts: autoshifts and practice run zonal shifts.

- With an _autoshift_, AWS helps reduce your time to recovery by shifting away application
  resource traffic from an Availability Zone during events, on your behalf.
- With _practice runs_, ARC starts a zonal shift on your behalf or you start a
  zonal shift practice run. The AWS practice run zonal shift
  shifts traffic away from an Availability Zone for a resource, and back again, on a weekly cadence. Practice
  runs help you to make sure that you have scaled up sufficient capacity for Availability Zones in a Region
  for your application to tolerate the loss of one Availability Zone.
  There are several best practices and considerations to keep in mind with autoshifts and practice runs. Review the following topics
  before you enable zonal autoshift or configure practice runs for a resource.

**Limit the time that clients stay connected to your endpoints**

When Amazon Application Recovery Controller (ARC) shifts traffic away from an impairment, for example, by using zonal shift or
zonal autoshift, the mechanism that ARC uses to move your application traffic is a DNS update.
A DNS update causes all new connections to be directed away from the impaired location. However, clients
with pre-existing open connections might continue to make requests against the impaired location until
the clients reconnect. To ensure a quick recovery, we recommend that you limit the amount of time clients
stay connected to your endpoints.

If you use an Application Load Balancer, you can use the `keepalive` option to configure how long connections
continue. We suggest that you lower the `keepalive` value to be inline with your recovery time goal for your
application, for example, 300 seconds. When you choose a `keepalive` time, consider that this value is a
trade off between reconnecting more frequently in general, which can affect latency, and more quickly
moving all clients away from an impaired AZ or Region.

For more information about setting the `keepalive` option for Application Load Balancer, see
the [HTTP client keepalive duration](../../../elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/application-load-balancers.md#http-client-keep-alive-duration "../../../elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/application-load-balancers.md#http-client-keep-alive-duration") in the Application Load Balancer User Guide.

**Prescale your resource capacity and test shifting traffic**

When AWS shifts traffic away from one Availability Zone for a zonal shift or an autoshift, it's important that
the remaining Availability Zones can service the increased request rates for your resource.
This pattern is known as _static stability_. For more information, see
the [Static stability using Availability Zones whitepaper](https://aws.amazon.com/builders-library/static-stability-using-availability-zones/ "https://aws.amazon.com/builders-library/static-stability-using-availability-zones/") in the Amazon Builder’s Library.

For example, if your application requires 30 instances to serve its clients, you should provision 15
instances across three Availability Zones, for a total of 45 instances. By doing this, when AWS shifts traffic
away from one Availability Zone—with an autoshift or during a practice run—AWS can still serve your
application’s clients with the remaining total of 30 instances, across two Availability Zones.

The zonal autoshift capability in ARC helps you to quickly recover from AWS events in an
Availability Zone when you have an application with resources that are pre-scaled to work normally
with the loss of one Availability Zone. Before you enable zonal autoshift for a resource, scale
your resource capacity in all configured Availability Zones in an AWS Region. Then, start zonal
shifts for the resource, to test that your application still runs normally when traffic is shifted
away from an Availability Zone.

After you test with zonal shifts, then enable zonal autoshift and
configure practice runs for application resources. Run your own on-demand practice runs to help ensure
that your configuration is scaled properly. Regular practice runs with zonal autoshift
help you to make sure—on an ongoing basis—that your capacity is still scaled appropriately. With sufficient capacity
across Availability Zones, your application can continue to serve clients, without interruption,
during an autoshift.

For more information about starting a zonal shift for a resource, see [Zonal shift in ARC](arc-zonal-shift.md "arc-zonal-shift.md").

**Be aware of resource types and restrictions**
Zonal autoshift supports shifting traffic out of an Availability Zone for all resources that
are supported by zonal shift. In a few specific resource scenarios, zonal autoshift does not shift traffic from an Availability
Zone for an autoshift.

For example, if the load balancer target groups in the Availability Zones don't
have any instances, or if all of the instances are unhealthy, then the load balancer is in a fail
open state. If AWS starts an autoshift for a load balancer in this scenario, an autoshift does
not change which Availability Zones the load balancer uses because the load balancer is already in
a fail open state. This is expected behavior. Autoshift cannot cause one Availability Zone to be
unhealthy and shift traffic to the other Availability Zones in an AWS Region if all
Availability Zones are failing open (unhealthy).

To see details about supported resources, including all of the requirements and exceptions to be aware of, see
[Supported resources](arc-zonal-shift.md "arc-zonal-shift.md").

**Specify alarms for practice runs**

You must configure at least one type of alarm (an outcome alarm) for practice runs with zonal autoshift. Optionally,
you can also configure a second type of alarm (blocking alarms).

When you consider the CloudWatch alarms that you configure for practice runs for your resource, keep in mind the following:

- You're required to configure at least one outcome alarm for a practice run configuration.
  For outcome alarms, we recommend that you configure CloudWatch alarms to go
  into an `ALARM` state when metrics for the resource, or your application, indicate that shifting
  traffic away from the Availability Zone adversely impacts performance. For example, you can determine a
  threshold for request rates for your resource, and then configure an alarm to go into an `ALARM` state when
  the threshold is exceeded. You are responsible for configuring appropriate alarms that cause AWS
  to end the practice run and return a `FAILED` outcome.
- We recommend that you follow the [AWS
  Well Architected Framework](../../../wellarchitected/2022-03-31/framework/perf_monitor_instances_post_launch_establish_kpi.md "../../../wellarchitected/2022-03-31/framework/perf_monitor_instances_post_launch_establish_kpi.md"), which advises you to implement key performance indicators (KPIs) as CloudWatch
  alarms. If you do so, you can use these alarms to create a composite alarm to use as a safety trigger, to
  prevent practice runs from starting if they might cause your application to miss a KPI. When the
  alarm is no longer in an `ALARM` state, ARC starts practice runs the next time
  a practice run is scheduled for the resource.
- For practice run blocking alarms, if you choose to configure one (or more), you might choose to track
  specific metrics that you use to indicate that you don't want an AWS practice run to start—for example,
  when an alarm indicates that there is an ongoing incident.
- For practice run alarms, you specify the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for each alarm, so
  you must first configure the alarm in Amazon CloudWatch. The CloudWatch alarms that you specify can be composite alarms, to enable
  you to include several metrics and checks for your application and resource that can trigger the alarm to
  go into an `ALARM` state. Or, you can configure separate alarms, and then specify more than one
  alarm of each type for your practice run configuration. For more information, see [Combining alarms](../../../AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/Create_Composite_Alarm.md "../../../AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/Create_Composite_Alarm.md")
  in the Amazon CloudWatch User Guide.
- Make sure that the CloudWatch alarms that you specify for practice runs are in the same
  Region as the resource that you're configuring a practice run for.

**Evaluate outcomes for practice runs**
ARC reports an outcome for each practice run. After a practice run, evaluate the outcome,
and determine if you need to take action. For example, you might need to scale capacity or adjust the
configuration for an alarm.

The following are the possible practice run outcomes:

- **SUCCEEDED:** No outcome alarms entered an `ALARM` state
  during the practice run, and the practice run completed the full 30 minute test period.
- **FAILED:** At least one outcome alarm entered an `ALARM` state during
  the practice run.
- **INTERRUPTED:** The practice run ended for a reason that was not
  the outcome alarm entering an `ALARM` state. A practice run can be interrupted for a variety of
  reasons, including the following:
  - Practice run was ended because AWS started an autoshift in the AWS Region or there
    was an alarm condition in the Region.
  - Practice run was ended because the practice run configuration was deleted for the
    resource.
  - Practice run was ended because a customer-initiated zonal shift was started for
    the resource in the Availability Zone that the practice run zonal shift was shifting traffic
    away from.
  - Practice run was ended because a CloudWatch alarm that was specified for the practice run
    configuration could no longer be accessed.
  - Practice run was ended because a blocking alarm specified for the practice run
    entered an `ALARM` state.
  - Practice run was ended for an unknown reason.
  - Practice run was ended because a zonal autoshift with
    precedence was initiated. See [Precedence for zonal shifts](arc-zonal-autoshift.md#ZAShiftPrecedence "arc-zonal-autoshift.md#ZAShiftPrecedence").

- **CAPACITY_CHECK_FAILED:** The check for balanced capacity across
  Availability Zones for your load balancing and Auto Scaling group resources failed.
- **PENDING:** The practice run is active (in progress). There's no outcome
  to return yet.
