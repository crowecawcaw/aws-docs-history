# How traffic is shifted away

For autoshifts and for practice run zonal shifts, traffic is shifted away from an Availability
Zone using the same mechanism that ARC uses for customer-initiated
zonal shifts. An unhealthy health check results in Amazon Route 53 withdrawing the
corresponding IP addresses for the resource from DNS, so that traffic is
redirected from the Availability Zone. New connections are now routed to
other Availability Zones in the AWS Region instead.

With an autoshift, when an Availability Zone recovers and AWS decides to end the
autoshift, ARC reverses the health check process, requesting the Route 53
health checks to be reverted. Then, the original zonal IP addresses are
restored and, if the health checks continue to be healthy, the Availability
Zone is included in the application's routing again.

It's important to be aware that autoshifts are not based on health checks that monitor the
underlying health of load balancers or applications. ARC uses health checks to move traffic
away from Availability Zones, by requesting health checks to be set to unhealthy, and
then restores health checks to normal again when it ends an autoshift or zonal shift.
