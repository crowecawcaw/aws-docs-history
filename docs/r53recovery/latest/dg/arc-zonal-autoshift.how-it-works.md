# When ARC schedules, starts, and ends practice runs

ARC schedules a practice run for a resource weekly, for about 30 minutes.
ARC schedules, starts, and manages practice runs for each resource independently. ARC does not
batch together practice runs for resources in the same account. You can also start on-demand practice
runs yourself, to help verify that your setup is safe for a zonal autoshift event.

When a practice run continues for the expected duration, without interruption, it is
marked with an outcome of `SUCCESSFUL`. There are several other possible outcomes:
`FAILED`, `INTERRUPTED`, `CAPACITY_CHECK_FAILED` and `PENDING`. Outcome values
and descriptions are included in the
[Outcomes for practice runs](arc-zonal-autoshift.md#ZAConsiderationsPracticeRunOutcomes "arc-zonal-autoshift.md#ZAConsiderationsPracticeRunOutcomes") section.

There are some scenarios when ARC interrupts a practice run and ends it. For example, if an
autoshift starts during a practice run, ARC interrupts the practice run and ends it. As another
example, say that the resource has an adverse response to a practice run and causes an alarm that
you've specified to monitor the practice run to go into an `ALARM` state. In this scenario,
ARC also interrupts the practice run and ends it.

In addition, there are several scenarios when ARC does not start a schedule practice run for a resource.

In response to interrupted and blocked practice runs for a resource, ARC does the following:

- If a practice run for a resource is interrupted while it's in progress, ARC considers the
  weekly practice run to be over, and schedules a new practice run for the resource for the next week.
  The weekly practice outcome is `INTERRUPTED` in this scenario, not `FAILED`.
  The practice run outcome set to `FAILED` only when the outcome alarm that monitors the
  practice run goes into an `ALARM` state during the practice run.
- If there is a blocking constraint when a practice run for a resource is scheduled to be
  started, ARC does not start the practice run. ARC continues regular monitoring, to determine if there
  are still one or more blocking constraints. When there aren't any blocking constraints, ARC starts
  the practice run for the resource.
  The following are examples of blocking constraints that stop ARC from starting, or continuing,
  a practice run for a resource:

- ARC does not start or continue practice runs when there is an AWS Fault Injection Service experiment in
  progress. If an AWS FIS event is active when ARC has scheduled a practice run to start, ARC does
  not start the practice run. ARC monitors throughout practice runs for blocking constraints,
  including an AWS FIS event. If an AWS FIS event starts while a practice run is active, ARC ends the practice run and
  doesn't attempt to start another one until the next regularly scheduled practice run for the
  resource.
- If there is a current AWS event in a Region, ARC does not start practice runs
  for resources, and ends active practice runs, in the Region.
  When the practice run finishes without being interrupted, ARC schedules
  the next practice run in a week, as usual. If a practice run isn't started because of a blocking constraint,
  such as a AWS FIS experiment or a blocked time window that you've specified, ARC continues to attempt
  to start a practice run until the practice run can be started.
