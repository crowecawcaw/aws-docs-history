# When AWS starts and stops autoshifts

When you enable zonal autoshift for a resource, you authorize AWS to shift away resource
traffic for an application from an Availability Zone during events, on your behalf, to help reduce time to
recovery.

To achieve this, zonal autoshift uses AWS telemetry to detect, as early as possible, that
there is an Availability Zone impairment that could potentially impact customers. When AWS
starts an autoshift, traffic to configured resources immediately starts shifting
away from the impaired Availability Zone that could potentially impact customers.

Zonal autoshift is a capability designed for customers who have pre-scaled their application resources
for all Availability Zones in an AWS Region. You should not rely on scaling on demand when an autoshift
or practice run starts.

AWS ends an autoshift when it determines that the Availability Zone has recovered.
