# Configuring monorepo build settings

When you store multiple projects or microservices in a single repository, it is called a
monorepo. You can use Amplify Hosting to deploy applications in a monorepo without creating
multiple build configurations or branch configurations.

Amplify supports apps in generic monorepos as well as apps in monorepos created using
npm workspace, pnpm workspace, Yarn workspace, Nx, and Turborepo. When you deploy your app,
Amplify automatically detects the monorepo build tool that you are using. Amplify
automatically applies build settings for apps in an npm workspace, Yarn workspace or Nx.
Turborepo and pnpm apps require additional configuration. For more information, see [Configuring Turborepo and pnpm
monorepo apps](#turborepo-pnpm-monorepo-configuration "#turborepo-pnpm-monorepo-configuration").

You can save the build settings for a monorepo in the Amplify console or you can
download the `amplify.yml` file and add it to the root of your repository.
Amplify applies the settings saved in the console to all of your branches unless it finds an
`amplify.yml` file in your repository. When an
`amplify.yml` file is present, its settings override any build settings
saved in the Amplify console.

## Monorepo build specification YAML syntax

reference

The YAML syntax for a monorepo build specification differs from the YAML syntax for a
repo that contains a single application. For a monorepo, you declare each project in a list
of applications. You must provide the following additional `appRoot` key for each
application you declare in your monorepo build specification:

**appRoot**

The root, within the repository, that the application starts in. This key must
exist, and have the same value as the `AMPLIFY_MONOREPO_APP_ROOT`
environment variable. For instructions on setting this environment variable, see [Setting the
AMPLIFY_MONOREPO_APP_ROOT environment variable](#setting-monorepo-environment-variable "#setting-monorepo-environment-variable").

The following monorepo build specification example demonstrates how to declare multiple
Amplify applications in the same repo. The two apps, `react-app`, and
`angular-app` are declared in the `applications` list. The
`appRoot` key for each app indicates that the app is located in the
`apps` root folder in the repo.

The `buildpath` attribute is set to `/` to run and build the app
from the monorepo project root. The `baseDirectory` attribute is the relative
path of `buildpath`.

An app using the following example build specification, will be built under the project
root and the build artifacts will be located at
`/packages/nextjs-app/.next`.

```
applications:
  - frontend:
      buildPath: '/'  # run install and build from monorepo project root
      phases:
        preBuild:
          commands:
            - npm install
        build:
          commands:
            - npm run build --workspace=nextjs-app
      artifacts:
        baseDirectory: packages/nextjs-app/.next
        files:
          - '**/*'
      cache:
        paths:
          - node_modules/**/*
    appRoot: packages/nextjs-app
```

## Setting the

AMPLIFY_MONOREPO_APP_ROOT environment variable

When you deploy an app stored in a monorepo, the app's
`AMPLIFY_MONOREPO_APP_ROOT` environment variable must have the same value as
the path of the app root, relative to the root of your repository. For example, a monorepo
named `ExampleMonorepo` with a root folder named `apps`, that
contains, `app1`, `app2`, and `app3` has the following
directory structure:

```
ExampleMonorepo
  apps
    app1
    app2
    app3

```

In this example, the value of the `AMPLIFY_MONOREPO_APP_ROOT` environment
variable for `app1` is `apps/app1`.

When you deploy a monorepo app using the Amplify console, the console automatically
sets the `AMPLIFY_MONOREPO_APP_ROOT` environment variable using the value that
you specify for the path to the app's root. However, if your monorepo app already exists in
Amplify or is deployed using AWS CloudFormation, you must manually set the
`AMPLIFY_MONOREPO_APP_ROOT` environment variable in the **Environment
variables** section in the Amplify console.

### Setting the

AMPLIFY_MONOREPO_APP_ROOT environment variable automatically during deployment

The following instructions demonstrate how to deploy a monorepo app with the Amplify
console. Amplify automatically sets the `AMPLIFY_MONOREPO_APP_ROOT`
environment variable using the app's root folder that you specify in the console.

###### To deploy a monorepo app with the Amplify console

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the [Amplify console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/amplify/ "https://console.aws.amazon.com/amplify/").
2. Choose **Create new app** in the upper right corner.
3. On the **Start building with Amplify** page, choose your Git
   provider, then choose **Next**.
4. On the **Add repository branch** page, do the following:
   1. Choose the name of your repository from the list.
   2. Choose the name of the branch to use.
   3. Select **My app is a monorepo**
   4. Enter the path to your app in your monorepo, for example,
      `apps/app1`.
   5. Choose **Next**.

5. On the **App settings** page, you can use the default settings or
   customize the build settings for your app. In the **Environment
   variables** section, Amplify sets `AMPLIFY_MONOREPO_APP_ROOT`
   to the path you specified in step 4d.
6. Choose **Next**.
7. On the **Review** page, choose **Save and
   deploy**.

### Setting the

AMPLIFY_MONOREPO_APP_ROOT environment variable for an existing app

Use the following instructions to manually set the
`AMPLIFY_MONOREPO_APP_ROOT` environment variable for an app that is already
deployed to Amplify, or has been created using CloudFormation.

###### To set the AMPLIFY_MONOREPO_APP_ROOT environment variable for an existing

app

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the [Amplify console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/amplify/ "https://console.aws.amazon.com/amplify/").
2. Choose the name of the app to set the environment variable for.
3. In the navigation pane, choose **Hosting**, and then choose
   **Environment variables**.
4. On the **Environment variables** page, choose **Manage
   variables**.
5. In the **Manage variables** section, do the following:
   1. Choose **Add new**.
   2. For **Variable**, enter the key
      `AMPLIFY_MONOREPO_APP_ROOT`.
   3. For **Value**, enter the path to the app, for example
      `apps/app1`.
   4. For **Branch**, by default Amplify applies the environment
      variable to all branches.

6. Choose **Save**.

## Configuring Turborepo and pnpm

monorepo apps

The Turborepo and pnpm workspace monorepo build tools get configuration information from
`.npmrc` files. When you deploy a monorepo app created with one of
these tools, you must have an `.npmrc` file in your project root
directory.

In the `.npmrc` file, set the linker for installing Node packages to
`hoisted`. You can copy the following line to your file.

```
node-linker=hoisted
```

For more information about `.npmrc` files and settings, see [pnpm .npmrc](https://pnpm.io/next/npmrc "https://pnpm.io/next/npmrc") in the _pnpm
documentation_.

Pnpm is not included in the Amplify default build container. For pnpm workspace and
Turborepo apps, you must add a command to install pnpm in the `preBuild` phase of
your app's build settings.

The following example excerpt from a build specification shows a `preBuild`
phase with a command to install pnpm.

```
version: 1
applications:
  - frontend:
      phases:
        preBuild:
          commands:
            - npm install -g pnpm
```
