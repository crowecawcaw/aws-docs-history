# Filtering the data that you want to view

With Cost Explorer, you can filter how you view your AWS costs by one or more of the
following values:

- **API operation**
- **Availability Zone (AZ)**
- **Billing entity**
- **Charge type**
- **Include all**
- **Instance type**
- **Legal entity**
- **Linked account**
- **Platform**
- **Purchase option**
- **Region**
- **Resources**
- **Service**
- **Tag**
- **Tenancy**
- **Usage type**
- **Usage type group**
  You can use Cost Explorer to see which service you use the most, which Availability Zone
  (AZ) most of your traffic is in, and which member account uses AWS the most. You can also
  apply multiple filters to look at intersecting datasets. For example, you can use the
  **Linked Account** and **Services** filters to
  identify the member account that spent the most money on Amazon EC2.

###### To filter your data

1. Open Cost Explorer.
2. For **Filters**, choose a value. After you make a selection, a
   new control appears with additional options.
3. In the new control, select the items from each list that you want to display in
   the chart. Or, start typing in the search box to have Cost Explorer autocomplete
   your selection. After you choose your filters, choose **Apply
   filters**.

###### Note

Each time that you apply filters to your costs, Cost Explorer creates a new
chart. However, you can use your browser's bookmark feature to [save configuration
settings](ce-bookmarks.md "ce-bookmarks.md") for repeated use. Forecasts aren't saved, and Cost Explorer
displays the most recent forecast when you revisit your saved chart.
You can continue refining your cost analysis by using multiple filters, grouping your data
by filter type, and choosing **Advanced Options** tab options.

## Combining filters to show data in common

Cost Explorer displays a chart that represents the data in common to all the filters
that you have selected. You can use this view to analyze subsets of cost data. For
example, assume that you set the **Service** filter to show costs that
are related to Amazon EC2 and Amazon RDS services and then select **Reserved**
using the filter. The cost chart will show how much money
**Reserved** instances on Amazon EC2 and Amazon RDS cost for each of the
three months.

###### Note

- AWS Cost and Usage Reports in Cost Explorer can use a maximum of 1024 filters.
- You can filter RI Utilization reports by only one service at a time. You can do
  this only for the following services:
  - Amazon EC2
  - Amazon Redshift
  - Amazon RDS
  - ElastiCache
  - OpenSearch Service

## Filters and logical operations (AND/OR)

When you select multiple filters and multiple values for each filter, Cost Explorer
applies rules that emulate the logical AND and OR operators to your selections. Within
each filter, Cost Explorer emulates the logical OR filter to your selection of filter
types. This means that the resulting chart adds the aggregate costs for each item
together. Using the previous example, you see bars for both of the selected services,
Amazon EC2 and Amazon RDS.

When you select multiple filters, Cost Explorer applies the logical AND operator to
your selections. For a more concrete example, assume that you use the
**Services** filter and specify Amazon EC2 and Amazon RDS costs for inclusion
and then also apply the **Purchase Options** filter to select a single
type of purchase option. You will see _only_ the
**Non-Reserved** charges incurred by Amazon EC2 and Amazon RDS.

## Filter and group options

In Cost Explorer, you can filter by the following groups:

**API operation**

Requests made to and tasks performed by a service, such as write and get
requests to Amazon S3.

**Availability Zone**

Distinct locations within a Region that are insulated from failures in
other Availability Zones. They provide inexpensive, low-latency network
connectivity to other Availability Zones in the same Region.

**Billing entity**

Helps you identify whether your invoices or
transactions are for AWS Marketplace or for purchases of other AWS services.
Possible values include:

- AWS: Identifies a transaction for AWS services other than in
  AWS Marketplace.
- AWS Marketplace: Identifies a purchase in AWS Marketplace.

**Charge type**

Different types of charges or fees.

- **Credit**: Any
  AWS credits that are applied to your account.
- **Other
  out-of-cycle charges**: Any subscription charges that
  aren't upfront reservation charges or support charges.
- **Recurring
  reservation fee**: Any recurring charges to your
  account. When you purchase a Partial Upfront or No Upfront Reserved
  Instance from AWS, you pay a recurring charge in exchange for a
  lower rate for using the instance. The recurring fees can result in
  spikes on the first day of every month, when AWS charges your
  account.
- **Refund**: Any
  refunds that you received. Refunds are listed as a separate line
  item in the data table. They don't appear as an item in the chart
  because they represent a negative value in the calculation of your
  costs. The chart displays only positive values.
- **Reservation applied usage**: Usage that AWS applied
  reservation discounts to.
- **Savings Plan covered usage**: Any on-demand cost
  that's covered by your Savings Plan. In an Unblended costs view,
  this represents the covered usage at on-demand rates. In an
  Amortized costs view, this represents the covered usage at your
  Savings Plan rates. Savings Plan covered usage line items are offset
  by the corresponding Savings Plan negation items.
- **Savings
  Plan negation**: Any offset cost through your Savings
  Plan benefit that’s associated with the corresponding Savings Plan
  covered usage item.
- **Savings Plan recurring fee**: Any recurring hourly
  charges that correspond with your No Upfront or Partial Upfront
  Savings Plan. The Savings Plan recurring fee is initially added to
  your bill on the day that you purchase a No Upfront or Partial
  Upfront Savings Plan. After the initial purchase, AWS adds the
  recurring fee hourly.

For an All Upfront Savings Plan, the line item indicates the
portion of the Savings Plan unused during the billing period. For
example, if a Savings Plan was 100% utilized for a billing period,
this shows as “0” in your amortized costs view. Any number greater
than “0” indicates an unused Savings Plan.

- **Savings Plan upfront fee**: Any one-time upfront fee
  from your purchase of an All Upfront or Partial Upfront Savings
  Plan.
- **Support
  fee**: Any charges that AWS charges you for a support
  plan. When you purchase a support plan from AWS, you pay a monthly
  charge in exchange for service support. The monthly fees can result
  in spikes on the first day of every month, when AWS charges your
  account.
- **Tax**: Any
  taxes that are associated with the charges or fees in your cost
  chart. Cost Explorer adds all taxes together as a single component
  of your costs. If you select five or fewer filters, Cost Explorer
  displays your tax expenses as a single bar. If you select six or
  more filters, Cost Explorer displays five bars, stacks, or lines,
  and then aggregates all remaining items, including taxes, into a
  sixth bar, stack slice, or plot line that's labeled **Other**.

If you choose to omit **RI upfront
fees**, **RI recurring
charges**, or **Support
charges** from your chart, Cost Explorer continues to
include any taxes that are associated with the charges.

Cost Explorer displays your tax costs in the chart only when you
choose **Monthly** drop down. When you
filter your cost chart, the following rules govern the inclusion of
taxes:

    1. Taxes are excluded if you select non-**Linked Account** filters,
     either singly or in combination with other filters.
    2. Taxes are included if you select the **Linked Accounts** filters.

- **Upfront
  reservation fee**: Any upfront fees that are charged to
  your account. When you purchase an All Upfront or Partial Upfront
  Reserved Instance from AWS, you pay an upfront fee in exchange for
  a lower rate for using the instance. The upfront fees can result in
  spikes in the chart for the days or months when you make your
  purchases.
- **Usage**: Usage
  that AWS didn't apply reservation discounts to.

**Instance type**

The type of RI that you specified when you launched an Amazon EC2 host, Amazon RDS
instance class, Amazon Redshift node, or Amazon ElastiCache node. The instance type determines
the hardware of the computer used to host your instance.

**Legal entity**

The Seller of Record of a specific product or service. In most cases, the
invoicing entity and legal entity are the same. The values might differ for
third-party AWS Marketplace transactions. Possible values include:

- Amazon Web Services, Inc. – The entity that sells AWS
  services.
- Amazon Web Services India Private Limited – The local Indian
  entity that acts as a reseller for AWS services in
  India.

**Linked account**

The member accounts in an organization. For more information, see [Consolidated billing for AWS Organizations](../../../awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/consolidated-billing.md "../../../awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/consolidated-billing.md").

**Platform**

The operating system that your RI runs on. **Platform** is either **Linux** or
**Windows**.

**Purchase option**

The method you choose to pay for your Amazon EC2 instances. This includes
Reserved Instances, Spot Instances, Scheduled Reserved Instances, and
On-Demand Instances.

**Region**

The geographic areas where AWS hosts your resources.

**Resources**

The unique identifier for your resources.

###### Note

To enable resource granularity, opt-in through on the Cost Explorer
settings page as the management account. This is available for Amazon
EC2 instances.

**Service**

AWS products. To learn what's available, see [AWS Products and
Services](https://aws.amazon.com/products/ "https://aws.amazon.com/products/"). You can use this dimension to filter costs by specific
AWS Marketplace software, including your costs for AMIs, web services, and
desktop apps. See the [What is AWS Marketplace?](../../../marketplace/latest/controlling-access/what-is-marketplace.md "../../../marketplace/latest/controlling-access/what-is-marketplace.md") guide for more information.

###### Note

You can only filter RI Utilization reports by one service at a time
and only for these services: **Amazon
EC2**, **Amazon Redshift**,
**Amazon RDS**, and **ElastiCache**.

**Tag**

A label that you can use to track the costs associated with specific areas
or entities within your business. For more information about working with
tags, see [Applying User-Defined Cost Allocation Tags](../../../awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/custom-tags.md#allocation-how "../../../awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/custom-tags.md#allocation-how") and [User attributes for Cost Allocation](../../../awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/user-attributes-cost-allocation.md "../../../awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/user-attributes-cost-allocation.md"), and
[Account tags for Cost Allocation](../../../awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/account-tags-cost-allocation.md "../../../awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/account-tags-cost-allocation.md").

**Tenancy**

Specifies if the Amazon EC2 instance is hosted on shared or single-tenant
hardware. Some tenancy values include **Shared
(Default)**, **Dedicated**, and
**Host**.

**Usage type**

Usage types are the units that each service uses to measure the usage of a
specific type of resource. For example, the
`BoxUsage:t2.micro(Hrs)` usage type filters by the running
hours of Amazon EC2 `t2.micro` instances.

**Usage type group**

Usage type groups are filters that collect a specific category of usage
type filters into one filter. For example,
`BoxUsage:c1.medium(Hrs)`,`BoxUsage:m3.xlarge(Hrs)`, and `BoxUsage:t1.micro(Hrs)`
are all filters for Amazon EC2 instance running hours, so they are collected
into the `EC2: Running Hours` filter.

Usage type groups are available for DynamoDB, Amazon EC2, ElastiCache,
Amazon RDS, Amazon Redshift, and Amazon S3. The specific groups available to
your account depend on what services you've used. The list of groups that
might be available includes but isn't limited to the following:
