# Cross-service confused deputy

prevention

The confused deputy problem is a security issue where an entity that doesn't have
permission to perform an action can coerce a more-privileged entity to perform the action.
In AWS, cross-service impersonation can result in the confused deputy problem.
Cross-service impersonation can occur when one service (the _calling
service_) calls another service (the _called service_). The
calling service can be manipulated to use its permissions to act on another customer's
resources in a way it should not otherwise have permission to access. To prevent this, AWS
provides tools that help you protect your data for all services with service principals that
have been given access to resources in your account.

We recommend using the [`aws:SourceArn`](../../../IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_condition-keys.md#condition-keys-sourcearn "../../../IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_condition-keys.md#condition-keys-sourcearn") and [`aws:SourceAccount`](../../../IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_condition-keys.md#condition-keys-sourceaccount "../../../IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_condition-keys.md#condition-keys-sourceaccount") global condition context keys in resource
policies to limit the permissions to the resource that AWS Cost Management features can give another service. If you use both global condition context keys, the `aws:SourceAccount`
value and the account in the `aws:SourceArn` value must use the same account ID
when used in the same policy statement.

The most effective way to protect against the confused deputy problem is to use the
`aws:SourceArn` global condition context key with the full ARN of the
resource. If you don't know the full ARN of the resource or if you are specifying multiple
resources, use the `aws:SourceArn` global context condition key with wildcards
(`*`) for the unknown portions of the ARN. For example,
`arn:aws:`servicename`::`123456789012`:*`. For AWS Budgets, the value of `aws:SourceArn` must be `arn:aws:budgets::`123456789012`:budget/*`.

The following example shows how you can use the `aws:SourceArn` and
`aws:SourceAccount` global condition context keys in AWS Budgets to prevent
the confused deputy problem.
