# Inheritance operators

Inheritance operators control how inherited policies and account policies merge into
the account's effective policy. These operators include value-setting operators and
child control operators.

When you use the visual editor in the AWS Organizations console, you can use only the
`@@assign` operator. Other operators are considered an advanced feature.
To use the other operators, you must manually author the JSON policy. Experienced policy
authors can use inheritance operators to control what values are applied to the
effective policy and limit what changes child policies can make.

For information about how policy inheritance works in an organization, see [Inheritance examples](inheritance-examples.md "inheritance-examples.md").

## Value-setting operators

You can use the following value-setting operators to control how your policy
interacts with its parent policies:

- `@@assign` – **Overwrites**
  any inherited policy settings with the specified settings. If the specified
  setting isn't inherited, this operator adds it to the effective policy. This
  operator can apply to any policy setting of any type.
  - For single-valued settings, this operator replaces the inherited
    value with the specified value.
  - For multi-valued settings (JSON arrays), this operator removes any
    inherited values and replaces them with the values specified by this
    policy.

- `@@append` – **Adds** the
  specified settings (without removing any) to the inherited ones. If the
  specified setting isn't inherited, this operator adds it to the effective
  policy. You can use this operator with only multi-valued settings.
  - This operator adds the specified values to any values in the
    inherited array.

- `@@remove` – **Removes**
  the specified inherited settings from the effective policy, if they exist.
  You can use this operator with only multi-valued settings.
  - This operator removes only the specified values from the array of
    values inherited from the parent policies. Other values can continue
    to exist in the array and can be inherited by child policies.

## Child control operators

Using child control operators is optional. You can use the
`@@operators_allowed_for_child_policies` operator to control which
value-setting operators child policies can use. You can allow all operators, some
specific operators, or no operators. By default, all operators (`@@all`)
are allowed.

- `"@@operators_allowed_for_child_policies"`:`["@@all"]`
  – Child OUs and accounts can use any operator in policies. By
  default, all operators are allowed in child policies.
- `"@@operators_allowed_for_child_policies"`:`["@@assign",
"@@append", "@@remove"]` – Child OUs and accounts can use
  only the specified operators in child policies. You can specify one or more
  value-setting operators in this child control operator.
- `"@@operators_allowed_for_child_policies"`:`["@@none"]`
  – Child OUs and accounts can't use operators in policies. You can use
  this operator to effectively lock in the values that are defined in a parent
  policy so that child policies can't add, append, or remove those
  values.

###### Note

If an inherited child control operator limits the use of an operator, you
can't reverse that rule in a child policy. If you include child control
operators in a parent policy, they limit the value-setting operators in all
child policies.
