# Automate the cleanup of images by using lifecycle

policies in Amazon ECR

Amazon ECR lifecycle policies provide more control over the lifecycle management of images in a
private repository. A lifecycle policy contains one or more rules, and each rule defines an
action for Amazon ECR. Based on the expiration criteria in the lifecycle policy, images can be
archived or expired based on the criteria specified in the lifecycle policy within 24 hours.
When Amazon ECR performs an action based on a lifecycle
policy, this action is captured as an event in AWS CloudTrail. For more information, see [Logging Amazon ECR actions with AWS CloudTrail](logging-using-cloudtrail.md "logging-using-cloudtrail.md").

## How lifecycle policies work

A lifecycle policy consists of one or more rules that determine which images in a
repository should be expired. When considering the use of lifecycle policies, it's
important to use the lifecycle policy preview to confirm which images the lifecycle
policy expires before applying it to a repository. Once a lifecycle policy is applied to
a repository, you should expect that images become expired within 24 hours after they
meet the expiration criteria. When Amazon ECR performs an action based on a lifecycle policy,
this is captured as an event in AWS CloudTrail. For more information, see [Logging Amazon ECR actions with AWS CloudTrail](logging-using-cloudtrail.md "logging-using-cloudtrail.md").

The following diagram shows the lifecycle policy workflow.

1. Create one or more test rules.
2. Save the test rules and run the preview.
3. The lifecycle policy evaluator goes through all of the rules and marks the
   images that each rule affects.
4. The lifecycle policy evaluator then applies the rules, based on rule priority,
   and displays which images in the repository are set to be expired or archived. A lower rule
   priority number means higher priority. For example, a rule with priority 1 takes
   precedence over a rule with priority 2.
5. Review the results of the test, ensuring that the images that are marked to be
   expired or archived are what you intended.
6. Apply the test rules as the lifecycle policy for the repository.
7. Once the lifecycle policy is created, you should expect that images are expired
   or archived within 24 hours after they meet the expiration criteria.

### Lifecycle policy evaluation rules

The lifecycle policy evaluator is responsible for parsing the plaintext JSON of
the lifecycle policy, evaluating all rules, and then applying those rules based on
rule priority to the images in the repository. The following explains the logic of
the lifecycle policy evaluator in more detail. For examples, see [Examples of lifecycle policies in
Amazon ECR](lifecycle_policy_examples.md "lifecycle_policy_examples.md").

- When reference artifacts are present in a repository, Amazon ECR lifecycle
  policies automatically expire or archive those artifacts within 24 hours of the
  deletion or archival of the subject image.
- All rules are evaluated at the same time, regardless of rule priority.
  After all rules are evaluated, they are then applied based on rule
  priority.
- An image is expired or archived by exactly one or zero rules.
- An image that matches the tagging requirements of a rule cannot be expired
  or archived by a rule with a lower priority.
- Rules can never mark images that are marked by higher priority rules, but
  can still identify them as if they haven't been expired or archived.
- The set of all rules selecting a specific storage class must contain a unique set of prefixes.
- Only one rule selecting a specific storage class is allowed to select untagged images.
- If an image is referenced by a manifest list, it cannot be expired or archived without
  the manifest list being deleted or archived first.
- Expiration is always ordered by `pushed_at_time` or `transitioned_at_time` and always expires older images before newer ones. If an image was archived and then restored at any point in the past, the image's `last_activated_at` is used instead of `pushed_at_time`.
- A lifecycle policy rule may specify either `tagPatternList` or
  `tagPrefixList`, but not both. However, a lifecycle policy
  may contain multiple rules where different rules use both pattern and prefix
  lists. An image is successfully matched if all of the tags in the
  `tagPatternList` or `tagPrefixList` value are
  matched against any of the image's tags.
- The `tagPatternList` or `tagPrefixList` parameters
  may only used if the `tagStatus` is `tagged`.
- When using `tagPatternList`, an image is successfully matched
  if it matches the wildcard filter. For example, if a filter of
  `prod*` is applied, it would match image-tags whose name
  begins with `prod` such as `prod`, `prod1`,
  or `production-team1`. Similarly, if a filter of
  `*prod*` is applied, it would match image-tags whose name
  contains `prod` such as `repo-production` or
  `prod-team`.

###### Important

There is a maximum limit of four wildcards (`*`) per
string. For example, `["*test*1*2*3", "test*1*2*3*"]` is
valid but `["test*1*2*3*4*5*6"]` is invalid.

- When using `tagPrefixList`, an image is successfully matched if
  **_all_** of the wildcard
  filters in the `tagPrefixList` value are matched against any of
  the image's tags.
- The `countUnit` parameter is only used if
  `countType` is `sinceImagePushed`, `sinceImagePulled`, or `sinceImageTransitioned`.
- With `countType = imageCountMoreThan`, images are sorted from
  youngest to oldest based on `pushed_at_time` and then all images
  greater than the specified count are expired or archived.
- With `countType = sinceImagePushed`, all images whose
  `pushed_at_time` is older than the specified number of days
  based on `countNumber` are expired or archived.
- With `countType = sinceImagePulled`, all images whose `last_recorded_pulltime` is older than the specified number of days based on `countNumber` are archived. If an image was never pulled, the image's `pushed_at_time` is used instead of the `last_recorded_pulltime`. If an image was archived and then restored at any point in the past, but never pulled since the image was restored, the image's `last_activated_at` is used instead of the `last_recorded_pulltime`.
- With `countType = sinceImageTransitioned`, all archived images whose `last_archived_at` is older than the specified number of days based on `countNumber` are expired.
- Expiration is always ordered by `pushed_at_time` and always expires older images before newer ones.
