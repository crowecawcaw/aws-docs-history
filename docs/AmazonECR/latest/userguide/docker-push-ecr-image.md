# Pushing a Docker image to an Amazon ECR private repository

You can push your container images to an Amazon ECR repository with the **docker
push** command.

Amazon ECR also supports creating and pushing Docker manifest lists that are used for
multi-architecture images. For information, see [Pushing a multi-architecture image to an Amazon ECR private repository](docker-push-multi-architecture-image.md "docker-push-multi-architecture-image.md").

###### To push a Docker image to an Amazon ECR repository

The Amazon ECR repository must exist before you push the image, or you must have a repository creation template defined. For more
information, see [Creating an Amazon ECR private repository to store images](repository-create.md "repository-create.md") and [Templates to control repositories created during a pull through cache, create on push, or replication action](repository-creation-templates.md "repository-creation-templates.md").

1. Authenticate your Docker client to the Amazon ECR registry to which you intend
   to push your image. Authentication tokens must be obtained for each registry
   used, and the tokens are valid for 12 hours. For more information, see [Private registry authentication in Amazon ECR](registry_auth.md "registry_auth.md").

To authenticate Docker to an Amazon ECR registry, run the **aws ecr
get-login-password** command. When passing the authentication
token to the **docker login** command, use the value
`AWS` for the username and specify the Amazon ECR registry URI you
want to authenticate to. If authenticating to multiple registries, you must
repeat the command for each registry.

###### Important

If you receive an error, install or upgrade to the latest version of
the AWS CLI. For more information, see [Installing the
AWS Command Line Interface](../../../cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.md "../../../cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.md") in the _AWS Command Line Interface User Guide_.

```
`aws ecr get-login-password --region `<region>` | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin `<`aws_account_id`>`.dkr.ecr.`<region>`.amazonaws.com`
```

2. If your image repository doesn't exist in the registry you intend to push
   to yet, and you have a repository creation template defined, you can push your
   image using your repository creation template's prefix and your desired
   repository name. ECR will automatically create the repository for you using
   the predefined settings of your repository creation template.

If you do not have a matching repository creation template defined, you will need to
create a repository. For more information, see [Templates to control repositories created during a pull through cache, create on push, or replication action](repository-creation-templates.md "repository-creation-templates.md") or
[Creating an Amazon ECR private repository to store images](repository-create.md "repository-create.md"). 3. Identify the local image to push. Run the **docker images**
command to list the container images on your system.

```
`docker images`
```

You can identify an image with the `repository:tag`
value or the image ID in the resulting command output. 4. Tag your image with the Amazon ECR registry, repository, and optional image tag
name combination to use. The registry format is
``aws_account_id`.dkr.ecr.`region`.amazonaws.com`. The
 repository name should match the repository that you created for your image. If you
 omit the image tag, we assume that the tag is `latest`.

The following example tags a local image with the ID `e9ae3c220b23` as ```aws_account_id`.dkr.ecr.`region`.amazonaws.com`/my-repository:tag`.

```
docker tag `e9ae3c220b23` ``aws_account_id`.dkr.ecr.`region`.amazonaws.com`/`my-repository:tag`
```

5. Push the image using the **docker push** command:

```
`docker push ``aws_account_id`.dkr.ecr.`region`.amazonaws.com`/`my-repository:tag``
```

6. (Optional) Apply any additional tags to your image and push those tags to
   Amazon ECR by repeating [Step 4](#image-tag-step "#image-tag-step") and [Step 5](#image-push-step "#image-push-step").
