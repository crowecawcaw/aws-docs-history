# Amazon ECR interface VPC endpoints (AWS PrivateLink)

You can improve the security posture of your VPC by configuring Amazon ECR to use an interface
VPC endpoint. VPC endpoints are powered by AWS PrivateLink, a technology that enables you
to privately access Amazon ECR APIs through private IP addresses (both IPv4 and IPv6). AWS PrivateLink restricts all
network traffic between your VPC and Amazon ECR to the Amazon network. You don't need an internet
gateway, a NAT device, or a virtual private gateway.

For more information about AWS PrivateLink and VPC endpoints, see [VPC Endpoints](../../../vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-endpoints.md "../../../vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-endpoints.md") in the _Amazon VPC User Guide_.

## Considerations for Amazon ECR VPC endpoints

Before you configure VPC endpoints for Amazon ECR, be aware of the following
considerations.

- To allow your Amazon ECS tasks hosted on Amazon EC2 instances to pull private images
  from Amazon ECR, create the interface VPC endpoints for Amazon ECS. For more information,
  see [Interface VPC Endpoints (AWS
  PrivateLink)](../../../AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/vpc-endpoints.md "../../../AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/vpc-endpoints.md") in the _Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide_.
- Amazon ECS tasks hosted on Fargate that pull container images from Amazon ECR can
  restrict access to the specific VPC their tasks use and to the VPC endpoint the
  service uses by adding condition keys to the task execution IAM role for the
  task. For more information, see [Optional IAM Permissions for
  Fargate Tasks Pulling Amazon ECR Images over Interface Endpoints](../../../AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task_execution_IAM_role.md "../../../AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task_execution_IAM_role.md") in
  the _Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide_.
- The security group attached to the VPC endpoint must allow incoming
  connections on port 443 from the private subnet of the VPC.
- Amazon ECR VPC endpoints support dual-stack (IPv4 and IPv6) connectivity. When you
  create a dual-stack VPC endpoint, it can handle traffic over both IPv4 and IPv6
  private IP addresses.
- VPC endpoints support Amazon ECR Public repositories through the AWS API SDK endpoint in US East (N. Virginia).
- VPC endpoints only support AWS provided DNS through Amazon Route 53. If you want
  to use your own DNS, you can use conditional DNS forwarding. For more
  information, see [DHCP Options
  Sets](../../../vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_DHCP_Options.md "../../../vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_DHCP_Options.md") in the _Amazon VPC User Guide_.
- If your containers have existing connections to Amazon S3, their connections might
  be briefly interrupted when you add the Amazon S3 gateway endpoint. If you want to
  avoid this interruption, create a new VPC that uses the Amazon S3 gateway endpoint
  and then migrate your Amazon ECS cluster and its containers into the new VPC.
- When an image is pulled using a pull through cache rule for the first time, if
  you've configured Amazon ECR to use an interface VPC endpoint using AWS PrivateLink
  then you need to create a public subnet in the same VPC, with a NAT gateway, and
  then route all outbound traffic to the internet from their private subnet to the
  NAT gateway in order for the pull to work. Subsequent image pulls don't require
  this. For more information, see [Scenario: Access the internet from a private subnet](../../../vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-nat-gateway.md#public-nat-internet-access "../../../vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-nat-gateway.md#public-nat-internet-access") in the
  _Amazon Virtual Private Cloud User Guide_.
- For workloads requiring FIPS 140-3 validated cryptographic modules, Amazon ECR
  supports FIPS endpoints for VPC endpoints.

### Considerations for Windows images

Images based on the Windows operating system include artifacts that are restricted
by license from being distributed. By default, when you push Windows images to an
Amazon ECR repository, the layers that include these artifacts are not pushed as they are
considered _foreign layers_. When the artifacts are provided by
Microsoft, the foreign layers are retrieved from Microsoft Azure infrastructure. For
this reason, to enable your containers to pull these foreign layers from Azure
additional steps are needed beyond creating the VPC endpoints.

It is possible to override this behavior when pushing Windows images to Amazon ECR by
using the `--allow-nondistributable-artifacts` flag in the Docker daemon.
When enabled, this flag will push the licensed layers to Amazon ECR which enables these
images to be pulled from Amazon ECR via the VPC endpoint without additional access to
Azure being required.

###### Important

Using the `--allow-nondistributable-artifacts` flag does not
preclude your obligation to comply with the terms of the Windows container base
image license; you cannot post Windows content for public or third-party
redistribution. Usage within your own environment is allowed.

To enable the use of this flag for your Docker installation, you must modify the
Docker daemon configuration file which, depending on your Docker installation, can
typically be configured in settings or preferences menu under the **Docker
Engine** section or by editing the
`C:\ProgramData\docker\config\daemon.json` file directly.

The following is an example of the required configuration. Replace the value with
the repository URI you are pushing images to.

```
{
    "allow-nondistributable-artifacts": [
        "`111122223333`.dkr.ecr.`us-west-2`.amazonaws.com"
    ]
}
```

After modifying the Docker daemon configuration file, you must restart the Docker
daemon before attempting to push your image. Confirm the push worked by verifying
that the base layer was pushed to your repository.

###### Note

The base layers for Windows images are large. The layer size will result in a
longer time to push and additional storage costs in Amazon ECR for these images. For
these reasons, we recommend only using this option when it is strictly required
to reduce build times and ongoing storage costs. For example, the
`mcr.microsoft.com/windows/servercore` image is approximately 1.7
GiB in size when compressed in Amazon ECR.

## Create the VPC endpoints for Amazon ECR

To create the VPC endpoints for the Amazon ECR service, use the [Creating an
Interface Endpoint](../../../vpc/latest/userguide/vpce-interface.md#create-interface-endpoint "../../../vpc/latest/userguide/vpce-interface.md#create-interface-endpoint") procedure in the
_Amazon VPC User Guide_.

Amazon ECR VPC endpoints support dual-stack (IPv4 and IPv6) connectivity. When you create a
dual-stack VPC endpoint, it automatically handles traffic over both IPv4 and IPv6 private
IP addresses. The endpoint will route traffic using the appropriate IP version based on
your client's network configuration and the endpoint's capabilities.

If you have existing IPv4-only VPC endpoints and want to migrate to dual-stack
endpoints, you can modify your existing endpoints to support dual-stack connectivity, or
create new dual-stack endpoints. When creating or modifying endpoints, ensure that your
VPC and subnets support the IP version you want to use. After creating dual-stack
endpoints, the endpoints will support both IPv4 and IPv6.

Amazon ECS tasks hosted on Amazon EC2 instances require both Amazon ECR endpoints and the Amazon S3
gateway endpoint.

Amazon ECS tasks hosted on Fargate using platform version `1.4.0` or later
require both Amazon ECR VPC endpoints and the Amazon S3 gateway endpoints.

Amazon ECS tasks hosted on Fargate that use platform version
`1.3.0` or earlier only require the
**com.amazonaws.`region`.ecr.dkr**
Amazon ECR VPC endpoint and the Amazon S3 gateway endpoints.

###### Note

The order that the endpoints are created in doesn't matter.

**com.amazonaws.`region`.ecr.dkr**

This endpoint is used for the Docker Registry APIs. Docker client commands
such as `push` and `pull` use this endpoint.

When you create this endpoint, you must enable a private DNS hostname. To
do this, ensure that the **Enable Private DNS Name** option
is selected in the Amazon VPC console when you create the VPC endpoint.

For FIPS 140-3 compliant connections, use the FIPS endpoint name **com.amazonaws.`region`.ecr-fips.dkr**

**com.amazonaws.`region`.ecr.api**

###### Note

The specified `region` represents the Region
identifier for an AWS Region supported by Amazon ECR, such as
`us-east-2` for the US East (Ohio) Region.

For FIPS 140-3 compliant connections, use the FIPS endpoint names: **com.amazonaws.`region`.ecr-fips.dkr** and **com.amazonaws.`region`.ecr-fips.api**.

This endpoint is used for calls to the Amazon ECR API. API actions such as
`DescribeImages` and `CreateRepository` go to this
endpoint.

When this endpoint is created, you have the option to enable a private DNS
hostname. Enable this setting by selecting **Enable Private DNS
Name** in the VPC console when you create the VPC endpoint. If
you enable a private DNS hostname for the VPC endpoint, update your SDK or
AWS CLI to the latest version so that specifying an endpoint URL when using
the SDK or AWS CLI isn't necessary.

For FIPS 140-3 compliant connections, use the FIPS endpoint name **com.amazonaws.`region`.ecr-fips.api**.

If you enable a private DNS hostname and are using an SDK or AWS CLI version
released before January 24, 2019, you must use the
`--endpoint-url` parameter to specify the interface
endpoints. The following example shows the format for the endpoint
URL.

```
`aws ecr create-repository --repository-name `name` --endpoint-url https://api.ecr.`region`.amazonaws.com`
```

If you don't enable a private DNS hostname for the VPC endpoint, you must
use the `--endpoint-url` parameter specifying the VPC endpoint ID
for the interface endpoint. The following example shows the format for the
endpoint URL.

```
`aws ecr create-repository --repository-name `name` --endpoint-url https://`VPC_endpoint_ID`.api.ecr.`region`.vpce.amazonaws.com`
```

For FIPS 140-3 compliant connections, use the FIPS endpoint URL:

```
`aws ecr create-repository --repository-name `name` --endpoint-url https://api.ecr-fips.`region`.amazonaws.com`
```

## Create the Amazon S3 gateway endpoint

For your Amazon ECS tasks to pull private images from Amazon ECR, you must create a gateway
endpoint for Amazon S3. The gateway endpoint is required because Amazon ECR uses Amazon S3 to store
your image layers. When your containers download images from Amazon ECR, they must access
Amazon ECR to get the image manifest and then Amazon S3 to download the actual image layers. The
following is the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Amazon S3 bucket containing the layers for
each Docker image.

```
arn:aws:s3:::prod-`region`-starport-layer-bucket/*
```

###### Note

If creating a dual-stack VPC endpoint for Amazon ECR, then you also need to create a
dual-stack Amazon S3 Gateway or Interface endpoint. Refer to [S3
documentation](../../../AmazonS3/latest/userguide/privatelink-interface-endpoints.md#privatelink-ip-address-types "../../../AmazonS3/latest/userguide/privatelink-interface-endpoints.md#privatelink-ip-address-types") for details.

Use the [Creating a
gateway endpoint](../../../vpc/latest/userguide/vpce-gateway.md#create-gateway-endpoint "../../../vpc/latest/userguide/vpce-gateway.md#create-gateway-endpoint") procedure in the _Amazon VPC User Guide_ to
create the following Amazon S3 gateway endpoint for Amazon ECR. When creating the endpoint, be
sure to select the route tables for your VPC.

**com.amazonaws.`region`.s3**

The Amazon S3 gateway endpoint uses an IAM policy document to limit access to
the service. The **Full Access** policy can be used because
any restrictions that you have put in your task IAM roles or other IAM
user policies still apply on top of this policy. If you want to limit Amazon S3
bucket access to the minimum required permissions for using Amazon ECR, see [Minimum Amazon S3 Bucket Permissions for Amazon ECR](#ecr-minimum-s3-perms "#ecr-minimum-s3-perms").

### Minimum Amazon S3 Bucket Permissions for Amazon ECR

The Amazon S3 gateway endpoint uses an IAM policy document to limit access to the
service. To allow only the minimum Amazon S3 bucket permissions for Amazon ECR, restrict
access to the Amazon S3 bucket that Amazon ECR uses when you create the IAM policy document
for the endpoint.

The following table describes the Amazon S3 bucket policy permissions needed by
Amazon ECR.

| Permission                                           | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `arn:aws:s3:::prod-`region`-starport-layer-bucket/*` | Provides access to the Amazon S3 bucket containing the layers for<br>each Docker image. Represents the Region identifier for an AWS<br>Region supported by Amazon ECR, such as `us-east-2` for<br>the US East (Ohio) Region. |

#### Example

The following example illustrates how to provide access to the Amazon S3 buckets
required for Amazon ECR operations.

```
{
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "Access-to-specific-bucket-only",
      "Principal": "*",
      "Action": [
        "s3:GetObject"
      ],
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Resource": ["arn:aws:s3:::prod-`region`-starport-layer-bucket/*"]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Create the CloudWatch Logs endpoint

Amazon ECS tasks using the Fargate launch type that use a VPC without an
internet gateway that also use the `awslogs` log driver to send log
information to CloudWatch Logs require that you create the
**com.amazonaws.`region`.logs**
interface VPC endpoint for CloudWatch Logs. For more information, see [Using
CloudWatch Logs with interface VPC endpoints](../../../AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/cloudwatch-logs-and-interface-VPC.md "../../../AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/cloudwatch-logs-and-interface-VPC.md") in the
_Amazon CloudWatch Logs User Guide_.

## Create an endpoint policy for your Amazon ECR VPC endpoints

A VPC endpoint policy is an IAM resource policy that you attach to an endpoint when
you create or modify the endpoint. If you don't attach a policy when you create an
endpoint, AWS attaches a default policy for you that allows full access to the
service. An endpoint policy doesn't override or replace user policies or
service-specific policies. It's a separate policy for controlling access from the
endpoint to the specified service. Endpoint policies must be written in JSON format. For
more information, see [Controlling Access to Services
with VPC Endpoints](../../../vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-endpoints-access.md "../../../vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-endpoints-access.md") in the _Amazon VPC User Guide_.

We recommend creating a single IAM resource policy and attaching it to both of the
Amazon ECR VPC endpoints.

The following is an example of an endpoint policy for Amazon ECR. This policy enables a
specific IAM role to pull images from Amazon ECR.

```
{
	"Statement": [{
		"Sid": "AllowPull",
		"Principal": {
			"AWS": "arn:aws:iam::`1234567890`:role/`role_name`"
		},
		"Action": [
			"ecr:BatchGetImage",
			"ecr:GetDownloadUrlForLayer",
                    "ecr:GetAuthorizationToken"
		],
		"Effect": "Allow",
		"Resource": "*"
	}]
}
```

The following endpoint policy example prevents a specified repository from being
deleted.

```
{
	"Statement": [{
			"Sid": "AllowAll",
			"Principal": "*",
			"Action": "*",
			"Effect": "Allow",
			"Resource": "*"
		},
		{
			"Sid": "PreventDelete",
			"Principal": "*",
			"Action": "ecr:DeleteRepository",
			"Effect": "Deny",
			"Resource": "arn:aws:ecr:`region`:`1234567890`:repository/`repository_name`"
		}
	]
}
```

The following endpoint policy example combines the two previous examples into a single
policy.

```
{
	"Statement": [{
			"Sid": "AllowAll",
			"Effect": "Allow",
			"Principal": "*",
			"Action": "*",
			"Resource": "*"
		},
		{
			"Sid": "PreventDelete",
			"Effect": "Deny",
			"Principal": "*",
			"Action": "ecr:DeleteRepository",
			"Resource": "arn:aws:ecr:`region`:`1234567890`:repository/`repository_name`"
		},
		{
			"Sid": "AllowPull",
			"Effect": "Allow",
			"Principal": {
				"AWS": "arn:aws:iam::`1234567890`:role/`role_name`"
			},
			"Action": [
				"ecr:BatchGetImage",
				"ecr:GetDownloadUrlForLayer",
                          "ecr:GetAuthorizationToken"
			],
			"Resource": "*"
		}
	]
}
```

###### To modify the VPC endpoint policy for Amazon ECR

1. Open the Amazon VPC console at
   [https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/ "https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/").
2. In the navigation pane, choose **Endpoints**.
3. If you have not already created the VPC endpoints for Amazon ECR, see [Create the VPC endpoints for Amazon ECR](#ecr-setting-up-vpc-create "#ecr-setting-up-vpc-create").
4. Select the Amazon ECR VPC endpoint to add a policy to, and choose the
   **Policy** tab in the lower half of the screen.
5. Choose **Edit Policy** and make the changes to the
   policy.
6. Choose **Save** to save the policy.

## Shared subnets

You can't create, describe, modify, or delete VPC endpoints in subnets that are shared
with you. However, you can use the VPC endpoints in subnets that are shared with
you.
