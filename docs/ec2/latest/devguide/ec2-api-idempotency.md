# Ensuring idempotency in Amazon EC2 API requests

When you make a mutating API request, the request typically returns a result before the
operation's asynchronous workflows have completed. Operations might also time out or
encounter other server issues before they complete, even though the request has already
returned a result. This could make it difficult to determine whether the request
succeeded or not, and could lead to multiple retries to ensure that the operation
completes successfully. However, if the original request and the subsequent retries are
successful, the operation is completed multiple times. This means that you might create
more resources than you intended.

_Idempotency_ ensures that an API request completes no more than one time.
With an idempotent request, if the original request completes successfully, any subsequent
retries complete successfully without performing any further actions. However, the result
might contain updated information, such as the current creation status.

## Idempotency in Amazon EC2

The following API actions are idempotent by default, and do not require
additional configuration. The corresponding AWS CLI commands also support
idempotency by default.

###### Idempotent by default

- AssociateAddress
- CreateVpnConnection
- DisassociateAddress
- ReplaceNetworkAclAssociation
- TerminateInstances

The following API actions optionally support idempotency using a _client
token_. The corresponding AWS CLI commands also support idempotency
using a client token. A client token is a unique, case-sensitive string of up to 64
ASCII characters. To make an idempotent API request using one of these actions,
specify a client token in the request. You should not reuse the same client token
for other API requests. If you retry a request that completed successfully using the
same client token and the same parameters, the retry succeeds without performing any
further actions. If you retry a successful request using the same client token, but
one or more of the parameters are different, other than the Region or Availability
Zone, the retry fails with an `IdempotentParameterMismatch` error.

###### Types of idempotency

- Regional – Requests are idempotent in each Region. However, you can
  use the same request, including the same client token, in a different Region.
- Zonal – Requests are idempotent in each Availability Zone in a Region.
  For example, if you specify the same client token in two calls to
  **AllocateHosts** in the same Region, the calls succeed
  if they specify different values for the **AvailabilityZone**
  parameter.

## RunInstances idempotency

The [RunInstances](../../../AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_RunInstances.md "../../../AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_RunInstances.md") API action uses both Regional and zonal
idempotency.

The type of idempotency that is used depends on how you specify the Availability
Zone in your RunInstances API request. The request uses **zonal
idempotency** in the following cases:

- If you explicitly specify an Availability Zone using the **AvailabilityZone** parameter in the **Placement** data type
- If you implicitly specify an Availability Zone using the **SubnetId** parameter

If you do not explicitly or implicitly specify an Availability Zone, the request
uses **Regional idempotency**.

### Zonal idempotency

Zonal idempotency ensures that a RunInstances API request is idempotent in
each Availability Zone in a Region. This ensures that a request with the same
client token can complete only once within each Availability Zone in a Region.
However, the same client token can be used to launch instances in other
Availability Zones in the Region.

For example, if you send an idempotent request to launch an instance in the
`us-east-1a` Availability Zone, and then use the same client
token in a request in the `us-east-1b` Availability Zone, we launch
instances in each of those Availability Zones. If one or more of the parameters
are different, subsequent retries with the same client token in those
Availability Zones either return successfully without performing any further
actions or fail with an `IdempotentParameterMismatch` error.

### Regional idempotency

Regional idempotency ensures that a RunInstances API request is idempotent in
a Region. This ensures that a request with the same client token can complete
only once within a Region. However, the exact same request, with the same client
token, can be used to launch instances in a different Region.

For example, if you send an idempotent request to launch an instance in the
`us-east-1` Region, and then use the same client token in a
request in the `eu-west-1` Region, we launch instances in each of
those Regions. If one or more of the parameters are different, subsequent
retries with the same client token in those Regions either return successfully
without performing any further actions or fail with an
`IdempotentParameterMismatch` error.

###### Tip

If one of the Availability Zones in the requested Region is not available,
RunInstances requests that use regional idempotency could fail. To leverage the Availability Zone features offered by
the AWS infrastructure, we recommend that you use zonal idempotency when
launching instances. RunInstances requests that use zonal idempotency and target
an available Availability Zone succeed even if another Availability Zone in the
requested Region is not available.

## Examples

### AWS CLI command examples

To make an AWS CLI command idempotent, add the `--client-token` option.

###### Example 1: Idempotency

The following [allocate-hosts](../../../cli/latest/reference/ec2/allocate-hosts.md "../../../cli/latest/reference/ec2/allocate-hosts.md")
command uses idempotency as it includes a client token.

```
aws ec2 allocate-hosts  --instance-type `m5.large`  --availability-zone `eu-west-1a`  --auto-placement `on`  --quantity `1` **--client-token `550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000`**
```

###### Example 2: run-instances regional idempotency

The following [run-instances](../../../cli/latest/reference/ec2/run-instances.md "../../../cli/latest/reference/ec2/run-instances.md")
command uses regional idempotency as it includes a client token but does not explicitly or implicitly
specify an Availability Zone.

```
aws ec2 run-instances --image-id `ami-b232d0db` --count 1 --key-name `my-key-pair` **--client-token `550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000`**
```

###### Example 3: run-instances zonal idempotency

The following [run-instances](../../../cli/latest/reference/ec2/run-instances.md "../../../cli/latest/reference/ec2/run-instances.md")
command uses zonal idempotency as it includes a client token and an explicitly specified
Availability Zone.

```
aws ec2 run-instances  **--placement "AvailabilityZone=`us-east-1a`"** --image-id `ami-b232d0db` --count 1 --key-name `my-key-pair` **--client-token `550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000`**
```

### API request examples

To make an API request idempotent, add the `ClientToken` parameter.

###### Example 1: Idempotency

The following [AllocateHosts](../../../AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_AllocateHosts.md "../../../AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_AllocateHosts.md")
API request uses idempotency as it includes a client token.

```
https://ec2.amazonaws.com/?Action=AllocateHosts
&AvailabilityZone=`us-east-1b`
&InstanceType=`m5.large`
&Quantity=`1`
&AutoPlacement=`off`
**&ClientToken=`550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000`**
&AUTHPARAMS
```

###### Example 2: RunInstances regional idempotency

The following [RunInstances](../../../AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_RunInstances.md "../../../AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_RunInstances.md")
API request uses regional idempotency as it includes a client token but does not explicitly or
implicitly specify an Availability Zone.

```
https://ec2.amazonaws.com/?Action=RunInstances
&ImageId=`ami-3ac33653`
&MaxCount=`1`
&MinCount=`1`
&KeyName=`my-key-pair`
**&ClientToken=`550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000`**
&AUTHPARAMS
```

###### Example 3: RunInstances zonal idempotency

The following [RunInstances](../../../AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_RunInstances.md "../../../AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_RunInstances.md")
API request uses zonal idempotency as it includes a client token and an explicitly specified Availability Zone.

```

**&Placement.AvailabilityZone=`us-east-1d`**
&ImageId=`ami-3ac33653`
