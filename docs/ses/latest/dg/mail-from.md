# Using a custom MAIL FROM domain

When an email is sent, it has two addresses that indicate its source: a From address
that's displayed to the message recipient, and a MAIL FROM address that indicates where the
message originated. The MAIL FROM address is sometimes called the _envelope
sender_, _envelope from_, _bounce
address_, or _Return Path_ address. Mail servers use the
MAIL FROM address to return bounce messages and other error notifications. The MAIL FROM
address is usually only viewable by recipients if they view the source code for the
message.

Amazon SES sets the MAIL FROM domain for the messages that you send to a default value unless
you specify your own (custom) domain. This section discusses the benefits of setting up a
custom MAIL FROM domain, and includes setup procedures.

## Why use a custom MAIL FROM domain?

Messages that you send through Amazon SES automatically use a subdomain of
`amazonses.com` as the default MAIL FROM domain. Sender Policy
Framework (SPF) authentication successfully validates these messages because the default
MAIL FROM domain matches the application that sent the email—in this case,
SES.

If you don't want to use the SES default MAIL FROM domain, and would rather use
a subdomain of a domain that you own, this is referred to in SES as using a
_custom_ MAIL FROM domain. To do this, it requires you to publish
your own SPF record for your custom MAIL FROM domain. In addition, SES also
requires you to set up an MX record so that your domain can receive the bounce and
complaint notifications that email providers send you.

By using a custom MAIL FROM domain, you have the flexibility to use SPF, DKIM, or both
to achieve [Domain-based Message
Authentication, Reporting and Conformance (DMARC)](send-email-authentication-dmarc.md "send-email-authentication-dmarc.md") validation. DMARC enables a
sender's domain to indicate that emails sent from the domain are protected by one or
more authentication systems. There are two ways to achieve DMARC validation: [Complying with DMARC through
SPF](send-email-authentication-dmarc.md#send-email-authentication-dmarc-spf "send-email-authentication-dmarc.md#send-email-authentication-dmarc-spf") and [Complying with DMARC through
DKIM](send-email-authentication-dmarc.md#send-email-authentication-dmarc-dkim "send-email-authentication-dmarc.md#send-email-authentication-dmarc-dkim").

## Choosing a custom MAIL FROM domain

In the following, the term _MAIL FROM domain_ always refers to a
subdomain of a domain that you own - this subdomain that you use for your custom MAIL
FROM domain must not be used for anything else and meet the following
requirements:

- The MAIL FROM domain has to be a subdomain of the parent domain of a verified
  identity (email address or domain).
- The MAIL FROM domain shouldn't be a subdomain that you also use to send email
  from.
- The MAIL FROM domain shouldn't be a subdomain that you use to receive
  email.

## Using SPF with your custom MAIL

FROM domain

_Sender Policy Framework_ (SPF) is an email validation standard
that's designed to prevent email spoofing. You can configure your custom MAIL FROM
domain with SPF to tell email providers which servers are allowed to send email from
your custom MAIL FROM domain. SPF is defined in [RFC 7208](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7208 "https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7208").

To set up SPF, you publish a TXT record to the DNS configuration for your custom MAIL
FROM domain. This record contains a list of the servers that you authorize to send email
from using your custom MAIL FROM domain. When an email provider receives a message from
your custom MAIL FROM domain, it checks the DNS records for that domain to make sure
that the email was sent from an authorized server.

If you want to use this SPF record as a way to comply with DMARC, the domain in the
From address must match the MAIL FROM domain. See [Complying with DMARC through
SPF](send-email-authentication-dmarc.md#send-email-authentication-dmarc-spf "send-email-authentication-dmarc.md#send-email-authentication-dmarc-spf").

The next section, [Configuring your custom MAIL FROM domain](#mail-from-set "#mail-from-set"), explains how to set up SPF for your
custom MAIL FROM domain.

## Configuring your custom MAIL FROM domain

The process of setting up a custom MAIL FROM domain requires you to add records to the
DNS configuration for the domain. SES requires you to publish an MX record so
that your domain can receive the bounce and complaint notifications that email providers
send you. You also have to publish an SPF (type TXT) record in order to prove that Amazon SES
is authorized to send email from your domain.

You can set up a custom MAIL FROM domain for an entire domain or subdomain, as well as
for individual email addresses. The following procedures show how to use the Amazon SES
console to configure a custom MAIL FROM domain. You can also configure a custom MAIL
FROM domain using the [SetIdentityMailFromDomain](../APIReference/API_SetIdentityMailFromDomain.md "../APIReference/API_SetIdentityMailFromDomain.md") API operation.

These procedures show you how to configure a custom MAIL FROM domain for an
entire domain or subdomain so that all messages sent from addresses on that
domain will use the this custom MAIL FROM domain.

###### To configure a verified domain to use a specified custom MAIL FROM

domain

1. Open the Amazon SES console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/ses/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ses/ "https://console.aws.amazon.com/ses/").
2. In the left navigation panel, under
   **Configuration**, choose
   **Identities**.
3. In the list of identities, choose the identity you want to configure
   where the **Identity type** is
   **Domain** and **Status** is
   _Verified_.
   1. If the **Status** is
      _Unverified_, complete the procedures at
      [Verifying a DKIM domain identity with your DNS
      provider](creating-identities.md#just-verify-domain-proc "creating-identities.md#just-verify-domain-proc") to verify the
      email address's domain.

4. At the bottom of the screen in the **Custom MAIL FROM
   domain** pane, choose **Edit**
   .
5. In the **General details** pane, do the
   following:
   1. Select the **Use a custom MAIL FROM domain**
      checkbox.
   2. For **MAIL FROM domain**, enter the subdomain
      that you want to use as the MAIL FROM domain.
   3. For **Behavior on MX failure**, choose one of
      the following options:
      - **Use
        default MAIL FROM domain** – If the
        custom MAIL FROM domain's MX record is not set up
        correctly, Amazon SES uses a subdomain of
        `amazonses.com`. The subdomain
        varies based on the AWS Region that you use Amazon SES
        in.
      - Reject message –
        If the custom MAIL FROM domain's MX record is not set up
        correctly, Amazon SES returns a
        `MailFromDomainNotVerified` error. Emails
        that you attempt to send from this domain are
        automatically rejected.

   4. Choose **Save changes** - you'll
      be returned to the previous screen.

6. Publish the MX and SPF (type TXT) records to the DNS server of the
   custom MAIL FROM domain:

In the **Custom MAIL FROM domain** pane, the
**Publish DNS records** table now displays the MX
and SPF (type TXT) records in that you have to publish (add) to your
domain's DNS configuration. These records use the formats shown in the
following table.

| Name                       | Type | Value                                      |
| -------------------------- | ---- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `subdomain`.`domain`.`com` | MX   | 10<br>feedback-smtp.`region`.amazonses.com |
| `subdomain`.`domain`.`com` | TXT  | "v=spf1<br>include:amazonses.com<br>~all"  |

In the preceding records,

    * `subdomain`.`domain`.`com`
     will be populated with your MAIL FROM subdomain
    * `region` will be populated with the
     name of the AWS Region where you want to verify the MAIL FROM
     domain (such as `us-west-2`, `us-east-1`,
     or `eu-west-1`, etc.)
    * The number *10* listed along with the MX
     value is the preference order for the mail server
     and will need to be entered
     into a separate value field as specified by your DNS provider's
     GUI
    * The SPF's TXT record value usually has to include the
     quotation marks, but some DNS providers don't require
     them.

From the **Publish DNS records** table, copy the MX
and SPF (type TXT) records by choosing the copy icon next to each value
and paste them into the corresponding fields in your DNS provider's GUI.
Alternatively, you can choose **Download .csv record
set** to save a copy of the records to your
computer.

###### Important

    * The specific procedures for publishing the MX and SPF
     (type TXT) records depend on your DNS or hosting provider.
     See your provider's documentation or contact them for
     information about adding these records to the DNS
     configuration for your domain.
    * To successfully set up a custom MAIL FROM domain with
     Amazon SES, you must publish exactly one MX record to the DNS
     server of your MAIL FROM domain. If the MAIL FROM domain has
     multiple MX records, the custom MAIL FROM setup with Amazon SES
     will fail.

If Route 53 provides the DNS service for your MAIL FROM domain, and
you're signed in to the AWS Management Console under the same account that you use
for Route 53, then choose **Publish Records Using
Route 53**. The DNS records are automatically applied to
your domain's DNS configuration.

If you use a different DNS provider, you have to publish the DNS
records to the MAIL FROM domain's DNS server manually. The procedure for
adding DNS records to your domain's DNS server varies based on your web
hosting service or DNS provider.

The procedures for publishing DNS records for your domain depend on
which DNS provider you use. The following table includes links to the
documentation for a few widely used DNS providers. This list isn't
exhaustive and doesn't signify endorsement; likewise, if your DNS
provider isn't listed, it doesn't imply they don't support MAIL FROM
domain configuration.

| DNS/Hosting provider name | Documentation link                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

When Amazon SES detects that the records are in place, you receive an email
informing you that your custom MAIL FROM domain was set up successfully.
Depending on your DNS provider, there might be a delay of up to 72 hours
before Amazon SES detects the MX record.
You can also set up a custom MAIL FROM domain for a specific email address. In
order to set up a custom MAIL FROM domain for an email address, you must modify
the DNS records for the domain that the email address is associated with.

###### Note

You can't set up a custom MAIL FROM domain for addresses on a domain that
you don't own (for example, you can't create a custom MAIL FROM domain for
an address on the `gmail.com` domain, because you can't
add the necessary DNS records to the domain).

###### To configure a verified email address to use a specified MAIL FROM

domain

1. Open the Amazon SES console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/ses/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ses/ "https://console.aws.amazon.com/ses/").
2. In the left navigation panel, under
   **Configuration**, choose
   **Identities**.
3. In the list of identities, choose the identity you want to configure
   where the **Identity type** is **Email
   address** and **Status** is
   _Verified_.
   1. If the **Status** is
      _Unverified_, complete the procedures at
      [Verifying an email address identity](creating-identities.md#just-verify-email-proc "creating-identities.md#just-verify-email-proc") to verify the email
      address's domain.

4. Under the **MAIL FROM Domain** tab,
   choose **Edit** in the **Custom
   MAIL FROM domain** pane.
5. In the **General details** pane, do the
   following:
   1. Select the **Use a custom MAIL FROM domain**
      checkbox.
   2. For **MAIL FROM domain**, enter the subdomain
      that you want to use as the MAIL FROM domain.
   3. For **Behavior on MX failure**, choose one of
      the following options:
      - **Use
        default MAIL FROM domain** – If the
        custom MAIL FROM domain's MX record is not set up
        correctly, Amazon SES uses a subdomain of
        `amazonses.com`. The subdomain
        varies based on the AWS Region that you use Amazon SES
        in.
      - Reject message –
        If the custom MAIL FROM domain's MX record is not set up
        correctly, Amazon SES returns a
        `MailFromDomainNotVerified` error. Emails
        that you attempt to send from this email address are
        automatically rejected.

   4. Choose **Save changes** - you'll
      be returned to the previous screen.

6. Publish the MX and SPF (type TXT) records to the DNS server of the
   custom MAIL FROM domain:

In the **Custom MAIL FROM domain** pane, the
**Publish DNS records** table now displays the MX
and SPF (type TXT) records in that you have to publish (add) to your
domain's DNS configuration. These records use the formats shown in the
following table.

| Name                       | Type | Value                                      |
| -------------------------- | ---- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `subdomain`.`domain`.`com` | MX   | 10<br>feedback-smtp.`region`.amazonses.com |
| `subdomain`.`domain`.`com` | TXT  | "v=spf1<br>include:amazonses.com<br>~all"  |

In the preceding records,

    * `subdomain`.`domain`.`com`
     will be populated with your MAIL FROM subdomain
    * `region` will be populated with the
     name of the AWS Region where you want to verify the MAIL FROM
     domain (such as `us-west-2`, `us-east-1`,
     or `eu-west-1`, etc.)
    * The number *10* listed along with the MX
     value is the preference order for the mail server
     and will need to be entered
     into a separate value field as specified by your DNS provider's
     GUI
    * The SPF's TXT record value has to include the quotation
     marks

From the **Publish DNS records** table, copy the MX
and SPF (type TXT) records by choosing the copy icon next to each value
and paste them into the corresponding fields in your DNS provider's GUI.
Alternatively, you can choose **Download .csv record
set** to save a copy of the records to your
computer.

###### Important

To successfully set up a custom MAIL FROM domain with Amazon SES, you
must publish exactly one MX record to the DNS server of your MAIL
FROM domain. If the MAIL FROM domain has multiple MX records, the
custom MAIL FROM setup with Amazon SES will fail.

If Route 53 provides the DNS service for your MAIL FROM domain, and
you're signed in to the AWS Management Console under the same account that you use
for Route 53, then choose **Publish Records Using
Route 53**. The DNS records are automatically applied to
your domain's DNS configuration.

If you use a different DNS provider, you have to publish the DNS
records to the MAIL FROM domain's DNS server manually. The procedure for
adding DNS records to your domain's DNS server varies based on your web
hosting service or DNS provider.

The procedures for publishing DNS records for your domain depend on
which DNS provider you use. The following table includes links to the
documentation for a few widely used DNS providers. This list isn't
exhaustive and doesn't signify endorsement; likewise, if your DNS

When Amazon SES detects that the records are in place, you receive an email
informing you that your custom MAIL FROM domain was set up successfully.
Depending on your DNS provider, there might be a delay of up to 72 hours
before Amazon SES detects the MX record.

## Custom MAIL FROM domain setup states with

Amazon SES

After you configure an identity to use a custom MAIL FROM domain, the state of the
setup is "pending" while Amazon SES attempts to detect the required MX record in your DNS
settings. The state then changes depending on whether Amazon SES detects the MX record. The
following table describes the email-sending behavior, and the Amazon SES actions associated
with each state. Each time the state changes, Amazon SES sends a notification to the email
address associated with your AWS account.

| State            | Email sending behavior                 | Amazon SES actions                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
