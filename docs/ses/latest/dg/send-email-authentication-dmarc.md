# Complying with DMARC authentication

protocol in Amazon SES

Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting and Conformance (DMARC) is an email
authentication protocol that uses Sender Policy Framework (SPF) and DomainKeys Identified
Mail (DKIM) to detect email spoofing and phishing. In order to comply with DMARC, messages
must be authenticated through either SPF or DKIM, but ideally, when both are used with
DMARC, you'll be ensuring the highest level of protection possible for your email
sending.

Let's briefly review which each does and how DMARC ties them all together:

- SPF – Identifies which mail servers are allowed
  to send mail on behalf of your custom MAIL FROM domain through a DNS TXT record that
  is used by DNS. Recipient mail systems refer to the SPF TXT record to determine
  whether a message from your custom domain comes from an authorized messaging server.
  Basically, SPF is designed to help prevent spoofing, but there are spoofing
  techniques that SPF is susceptible to in practice and
  this is why you need to also use DKIM along with DMARC.
- DKIM – Adds a digital signature to your
  outbound messages in the email header.

Receiving email systems can use this digital signature to help verify whether
incoming email is signed by a key owned by the domain.
However, when a receiving
email system forwards a message, the message's envelope is changed in a way that
invalidates SPF authentication. Since the digital signature stays with the email
message because it's part of the email header, DKIM works even when a message has
been forwarded between mail servers (as long as the message content has not been
modified).

- DMARC – Ensures that there is domain alignment
  with at least one of SPF and DKIM. Using SPF and DKIM alone does nothing to insure
  that the From address is authenticated (this is the email address your recipient
  sees in their email client).
  SPF only checks the domain specified in the MAIL
  FROM address (not seen by your recipient). DKIM only checks the domain specified in
  the DKIM signature (also, not seen by your recipient). DMARC addresses these two
  issues by requiring domain alignment to be correct on either SPF or DKIM:
  - For SPF to pass DMARC alignment the domain in the From address must match
    the domain in the MAIL FROM address (also referred to as Return-Path and
    Envelope-from address). This is rarely possible with forwarded mail because
    it gets stripped away or when sending mail through third-party bulk email
    providers because the Return-Path (MAIL FROM) is used for bounces and
    complaints that the provider (SES) tracks using an address they
    own.
  - For DKIM to pass DMARC alignment, the domain specified in the DKIM
    signature must match the domain in the From address. If you use third-party
    senders or services that send mail on your behalf, this can be accomplished
    by ensuring the third-party sender is properly configured for DKIM signing
    and you have added the appropriate DNS records within your domain. Receiving
    mail servers will then be able to verify email sent to them by your
    third-party as if it was email sent by someone authorized to use an address
    within the domain.

###### Putting it all together with DMARC

The DMARC alignment checks we discussed above show how SPF, DKIM, and DMARC all work
together to increase trust of your domain and delivery of your email to inboxes. DMARC
accomplishes this by ensuring that the From address, seen by the recipient, is
authenticated by either SPF or DKIM:

- A message passes DMARC if one or both of the described SPF or DKIM checks
  pass.
- A message fails DMARC if both of the described SPF or DKIM checks fail.
  Therefore, both SPF and DKIM are necessary for DMARC to have the best chance at achieving
  authentication for your sent email, and by utilizing all three, you'll help to ensure you
  have a fully protected sending domain.

DMARC also allows you to instruct email servers how to handle emails when they fail DMARC
authentication through policies that you set. This will be explained in the following
section, [Setting up the DMARC policy on
your domain](#send-email-authentication-dmarc-dns "#send-email-authentication-dmarc-dns"), that contains information on
how to configure your SES domains so that the emails you send comply with the DMARC
authentication protocol through both SPF and DKIM.

## Setting up the DMARC policy on

your domain

To set up DMARC, you have to modify the DNS settings for your domain. The DNS settings
for your domain should include a TXT record that specifies the domain's DMARC settings.
The procedures for adding TXT records to your DNS configuration depend on which DNS or
hosting provider you use. If you use Route 53, see [Working with Records](../../../Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/rrsets-working-with.md "../../../Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/rrsets-working-with.md") in the
_Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide_. If you use another provider, see the DNS
configuration documentation for your provider.

The name of the TXT record you create should be
`_dmarc.`example.com`, where
 `example.com`` is your domain. The value of
the TXT record contains the DMARC policy that applies to your domain. The following is
an example of a TXT record that contains a DMARC policy:

| Name                 | Type  | Value                                                            |
| -------------------- | ----- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `_dmarc.example.com` | `TXT` | `"v=DMARC1;p=quarantine;rua=mailto:my_dmarc_report@example.com"` |

In the preceding DMARC policy example, this policy tells email providers to do the
following:

- For any messages that fail authentication, send them to the Spam folder as
  specified by the policy parameter, `p=quarantine`. Other options
  include doing nothing by using `p=none`, or reject the message
  outright by using `p=reject`.
  - The next section discusses how and when to use these three policy
    settings—_using the wrong one at the wrong time can
    cause your email to not be delivered,_ see [Best practices for
    implementing DMARC](#send-email-authentication-dmarc-implement "#send-email-authentication-dmarc-implement").

- Send reports about all emails that failed authentication in a digest (that is,
  a report that aggregates the data for a certain time period, rather than sending
  individual reports for each event) as specified by the reporting parameter,
  `rua=mailto:my_dmarc_report@example.com`
  (_rua_ stands for Reporting URI for Aggregate reports).
  Email providers typically send these aggregated reports once per day, although
  these policies differ from provider to provider.

To learn more about configuring DMARC for your domain, see the [Overview](https://dmarc.org/overview/ "https://dmarc.org/overview/") on the DMARC website.

For complete specifications of the DMARC system, see [Internet
Engineering Task Force (IETF) DMARC Draft](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-dmarc-dmarcbis/ "https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-dmarc-dmarcbis/").

## Best practices for

implementing DMARC

It's best to implement your DMARC policy enforcement in a gradual and phased approach
so that it doesn't interrupt the rest of your mail flow. Create and implement a roll-out
plan that follows these steps. Do each of these steps first with each of your
sub-domains, and finally with the top-level domain in your organization before moving on
to the next step.

1. Monitor the impact of implementing DMARC (p=none).
   - Start with a simple monitoring-mode record for a sub-domain or domain
     that requests that mail receiving organizations send you statistics
     about messages that they see using that domain. A monitoring-mode record
     is a DMARC TXT record that has its policy set to none
     `p=none`.
   - Reports generated through DMARC will give the numbers and sources of
     messages that pass these checks, versus those that don't. You can easily
     see how much of your legitimate traffic is or isn't covered by them.
     You'll see signs of forwarding, since forwarded messages will fail SPF
     and DKIM if the content is modified. You'll also begin to see how many
     fraudulent messages are being sent, and where they're sent from.
   - The goals of this step are to
     learn what emails will be impacted when you implement one of the next
     two steps, and to have any third-party or authorized senders get their
     SPF or DKIM policies into alignment.
   - Best for existing domains.

2. Request that external mail systems quarantine mail that fails DMARC
   (p=quarantine).
   - When you believe that all or most of your legitimate traffic is
     sending domain-aligned with either SPF
     or DKIM, and you understand the impact of implementing DMARC, you can
     implement a quarantine policy. A quarantine policy is a DMARC TXT record
     that has its policy set to quarantine `p=quarantine`. By
     doing this, you're asking DMARC receivers to put messages from your
     domain that fail DMARC into the local equivalent of a spam folder
     instead of your customers' inboxes.
   - Best for transitioning domains that have analyzed DMARC reports
     during Step 1.

3. Request that external mail systems not accept messages that fail DMARC
   (p=reject).
   - Implementing a reject policy is usually the final step. A reject
     policy is a DMARC TXT record that has its policy set to reject
     `p=reject`. When you do this, you're asking DMARC
     receivers not to accept messages that fail the DMARC checks—this
     means they won't even be quarantined to a spam or junk folder, but will
     be rejected outright.
   - When using a reject policy, you'll know exactly which messages are
     failing the DMARC policy as the rejection will result in a SMTP bounce.
     With quarantine, the aggregate data provides information about the
     percentages of email passing or failing SPF, DKIM, and DMARC
     checks.
   - Best for new domains or existing domains that have gone through the
     prior two steps.

## Complying with DMARC through

SPF

For an email to comply with DMARC based on SPF, both of the following conditions must
be met:

- The message must pass an SPF check based on having a valid SPF (type TXT)
  record that you've to published to your custom MAIL FROM domain's DNS
  configuration.
- The domain in the From address of the email header must align (match) with the
  domain, or a subdomain of, that's specified in the MAIL FROM address.
  In order to
  achieve SPF alignment with SES, the domain's DMARC policy must not
  specify a strict SPF policy (aspf=s).

To comply with these requirements, complete the following steps:

- Set up a custom MAIL FROM domain by completing the procedures in [Using a custom MAIL FROM domain](mail-from.md "mail-from.md").
- Ensure that your sending domain uses a relaxed policy for SPF. If you haven't
  changed your domain's policy alignment, it uses a relaxed policy by default as
  does SES.

###### Note

You can determine your domain's DMARC alignment for SPF by typing the
following command at the command line, replacing
`example.com` with your
domain:

```
dig TXT _dmarc.`example.com`
```

In the output of this command, under **Non-authoritative
answer**, look for a record that begins with
`v=DMARC1`. If this record includes the string
`aspf=r`, or if the `aspf` string is not present
at all, then your domain uses relaxed alignment for SPF. If the record
includes the string `aspf=s`, then your domain uses strict
alignment for SPF. Your system administrator will need to remove this tag
from the DMARC TXT record in your domain's DNS configuration.

Alternatively, you can use a web-based DMARC lookup tool, such as the
[DMARC
Inspector](https://dmarcian.com/dmarc-inspector/ "https://dmarcian.com/dmarc-inspector/") from the
dmarcian
website or the [DMARC Check Tool](https://mxtoolbox.com/dmarc.aspx "https://mxtoolbox.com/dmarc.aspx") tool
from the
MxToolBox
website, to determine your domain's policy alignment for
SPF.

## Complying with DMARC through

DKIM

For an email to comply with DMARC based on DKIM, both of the following conditions must
be met:

- The message must have a valid DKIM signature and passes the DKIM check.
- The domain specified in the DKIM signature must align (match) with the domain
  in the From address.

If the domain's DMARC policy specifies strict alignment for DKIM, these domains
must match exactly (SES uses a strict DKIM policy by default).

To comply with these requirements, complete the following steps:

- Set up Easy DKIM by completing the procedures in [Easy DKIM in Amazon SES](send-email-authentication-dkim-easy.md "send-email-authentication-dkim-easy.md"). When you use Easy DKIM,
  Amazon SES automatically signs your emails.

###### Note

Rather than use Easy DKIM, you can also [manually sign your
messages](send-email-authentication-dkim-manual.md "send-email-authentication-dkim-manual.md"). However, use caution if you choose to do so, because
Amazon SES does not validate the DKIM signature that you construct. For this
reason, we highly recommend using Easy DKIM.

- Ensure the domain specified in the DKIM signature is aligned to the domain in
  the From address. Or, if sending from a subdomain of the domain in the From
  address, ensure that your DMARC policy is set to relaxed alignment.

###### Note

You can determine your domain's DMARC alignment for DKIM by typing the
following command at the command line, replacing
`example.com` with your
domain:

```
dig TXT _dmarc.`example.com`
```

In the output of this command, under **Non-authoritative
answer**, look for a record that begins with
`v=DMARC1`. If this record includes the string
`adkim=r`, or if the `adkim` string is not present
at all, then your domain uses relaxed alignment for DKIM. If the record
includes the string `adkim=s`, then your domain uses strict
alignment for DKIM. Your system administrator will need to remove this tag
from the DMARC TXT record in your domain's DNS configuration.

Alternatively, you can use a web-based DMARC lookup tool, such as the
[DMARC
Inspector](https://dmarcian.com/dmarc-inspector/ "https://dmarcian.com/dmarc-inspector/") from
the
dmarcian website or the [DMARC
Check Tool](https://mxtoolbox.com/dmarc.aspx "https://mxtoolbox.com/dmarc.aspx") tool from the MxToolBox website,
to determine your domain's policy alignment for DKIM.
