# Logging Refactor Spaces API calls using AWS CloudTrail

AWS Migration Hub Refactor Spaces is integrated with AWS CloudTrail, a service that provides a record of actions
taken by a user, role, or an AWS service in Refactor Spaces. CloudTrail captures all API calls for
Refactor Spaces as events. The calls captured include calls from the Refactor Spaces console and
code calls to the Refactor Spaces API operations. If you create a trail, you can enable
continuous delivery of CloudTrail events to an Amazon S3 bucket, including events for Refactor Spaces. If
you don't configure a trail, you can still view the most recent events in the CloudTrail console
in **Event history**. Using the information collected by CloudTrail, you can
determine the request that was made to Refactor Spaces, the IP address from which the request
was made, who made the request, when it was made, and additional details.

To learn more about CloudTrail, see the [AWS CloudTrail User Guide](../../../awscloudtrail/latest/userguide.md "../../../awscloudtrail/latest/userguide.md").

## Refactor Spaces information in CloudTrail

CloudTrail is enabled on your AWS account when you create the account. When activity occurs
in Refactor Spaces, that activity is recorded in a CloudTrail event along with other AWS service events
in **Event history**. You can view, search, and download recent events in
your AWS account. For more information, see [Viewing Events with CloudTrail Event History](../../../awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/view-cloudtrail-events.md "../../../awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/view-cloudtrail-events.md").

For an ongoing record of events in your AWS account, including events for Refactor Spaces,
create a trail. A _trail_ enables CloudTrail to deliver log files to an Amazon S3 bucket.
By default, when you create a trail in the console, the trail applies to all AWS Regions. The trail
logs events from all Regions in the AWS partition and delivers the log files to the Amazon S3 bucket
that you specify. Additionally, you can configure other AWS services to further analyze and act
upon the event data collected in CloudTrail logs. For more information, see the following:

- [Overview for creating a trail](../../../awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/cloudtrail-create-and-update-a-trail.md "../../../awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/cloudtrail-create-and-update-a-trail.md")
- [CloudTrail supported services and integrations](../../../awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/cloudtrail-aws-service-specific-topics.md#cloudtrail-aws-service-specific-topics-integrations "../../../awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/cloudtrail-aws-service-specific-topics.md#cloudtrail-aws-service-specific-topics-integrations")
- [Configuring Amazon SNS notifications for CloudTrail](../../../awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/getting_notifications_top_level.md "../../../awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/getting_notifications_top_level.md")
- [Receiving CloudTrail log files from
  multiple Regions](../../../awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/receive-cloudtrail-log-files-from-multiple-regions.md "../../../awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/receive-cloudtrail-log-files-from-multiple-regions.md")
- [Receiving CloudTrail log files from
  multiple accounts](../../../awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/cloudtrail-receive-logs-from-multiple-accounts.md "../../../awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/cloudtrail-receive-logs-from-multiple-accounts.md")

All Refactor Spaces actions are logged by CloudTrail and are documented in the [Refactor Spaces API Reference](../APIReference/Welcome.md "../APIReference/Welcome.md"). For example,
calls to the `CreateEnvironment`, `GetEnvironment` and `ListEnvironments` actions generate
entries in the CloudTrail log files.

Every event or log entry contains information about who generated the request. The
identity information helps you determine the following:

- Whether the request was made with root or IAM user credentials.
- Whether the request was made with temporary security credentials for a role or
  federated user.
- Whether the request was made by another AWS service.

For more information, see the [CloudTrail userIdentity element](../../../awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/cloudtrail-event-reference-user-identity.md "../../../awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/cloudtrail-event-reference-user-identity.md").

## Understanding Refactor Spaces log file entries

A trail is a configuration that enables delivery of events as log files to an Amazon S3 bucket
that you specify. CloudTrail log files contain one or more log entries. An event represents a single
request from any source and includes information about the requested action, the date and time
of the action, request parameters, and so on. CloudTrail log files aren't an ordered stack trace of
the public API calls, so they don't appear in any specific order.
