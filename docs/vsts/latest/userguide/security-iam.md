# Identity and Access Management

AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) is an AWS service that helps an administrator securely control access
to AWS resources. IAM administrators control who can be _authenticated_ (signed in) and _authorized_
(have permissions) to use AWS resources. IAM is an AWS service that you can
use with no additional charge.

## Audience

How you use AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) differs, depending on the work that you do in
AWS.

**Service user** – If you use AWS services to do
your job, then your administrator provides you with the credentials and permissions that you
need. As you use more AWS features to do your work, you might need additional permissions.
Understanding how access is managed can help you request the right permissions from your
administrator. If you cannot access a feature in AWS, see [Troubleshooting AWS identity and
access](#security_iam_troubleshoot "#security_iam_troubleshoot") or the user
guide of the AWS service you are using.

**Service administrator** – If you're in charge
of AWS resources at your company, you probably have full access to AWS. It's your job
to determine which AWS features and resources your service users should access. You must
then submit requests to your IAM administrator to change the permissions of your service
users. Review the information on this page to understand the basic concepts of IAM. To learn
more about how your company can use IAM with AWS, see the user guide of the AWS service
you are using.

**IAM administrator** – If you're an IAM
administrator, you might want to learn details about how you can write policies to manage
access to AWS. To view example AWS identity-based policies that you can use in IAM, see
the user guide of the AWS service you are using.

## Authenticating with identities

Authentication is how you sign in to AWS using your identity credentials. You must be authenticated as the AWS account root user, an IAM user, or by assuming an IAM role.

You can sign in as a federated identity using credentials from an identity source like AWS IAM Identity Center (IAM Identity Center), single sign-on authentication, or Google/Facebook credentials. For more information about signing in, see [How to sign in to your AWS account](../../../signin/latest/userguide/how-to-sign-in.md "../../../signin/latest/userguide/how-to-sign-in.md") in the _AWS Sign-In User Guide_.

For programmatic access, AWS provides an SDK and CLI to cryptographically sign requests. For more information, see [AWS Signature Version 4 for API requests](../../../IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_sigv.md "../../../IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_sigv.md") in the _IAM User Guide_.

### AWS account root user

When you create an AWS account, you begin with one sign-in identity called the AWS account _root user_ that has complete access to all AWS services and resources. We strongly recommend that you don't use the root user for everyday tasks. For tasks that require root user credentials, see [Tasks that require root user credentials](../../../IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_root-user.md#root-user-tasks "../../../IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_root-user.md#root-user-tasks") in the _IAM User Guide_.

### Federated identity

As a best practice, require human users to use federation with an identity provider to access AWS services using temporary credentials.

A _federated identity_ is a user from your enterprise directory, web identity provider, or AWS Directory Service that accesses AWS services using credentials from an identity source. Federated identities assume roles that provide temporary credentials.

For centralized access management, we recommend AWS IAM Identity Center. For more information, see [What is IAM Identity Center?](../../../singlesignon/latest/userguide/what-is.md "../../../singlesignon/latest/userguide/what-is.md") in the _AWS IAM Identity Center User Guide_.

### IAM users and groups

An _[IAM user](../../../IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_users.md "../../../IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_users.md")_ is an identity with specific permissions for a single person or application. We recommend using temporary credentials instead of IAM users with long-term credentials. For more information, see [Require human users to use federation with an identity provider to access AWS using temporary credentials](../../../IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.md#bp-users-federation-idp "../../../IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.md#bp-users-federation-idp") in the _IAM User Guide_.

An [_IAM group_](../../../IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_groups.md "../../../IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_groups.md") specifies a collection of IAM users and makes permissions easier to manage for large sets of users. For more information, see [Use cases for IAM users](../../../IAM/latest/UserGuide/gs-identities-iam-users.md "../../../IAM/latest/UserGuide/gs-identities-iam-users.md") in the _IAM User Guide_.

### IAM roles

An _[IAM role](../../../IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles.md "../../../IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles.md")_ is an identity with specific permissions that provides temporary credentials. You can assume a role by [switching from a user to an IAM role (console)](../../../IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use_switch-role-console.md "../../../IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use_switch-role-console.md") or by calling an AWS CLI or AWS API operation. For more information, see [Methods to assume a role](../../../IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_manage-assume.md "../../../IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_manage-assume.md") in the _IAM User Guide_.

IAM roles are useful for federated user access, temporary IAM user permissions, cross-account access, cross-service access, and applications running on Amazon EC2. For more information, see [Cross account resource access in IAM](../../../IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies-cross-account-resource-access.md "../../../IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies-cross-account-resource-access.md") in the _IAM User Guide_.

## Managing access using policies

You control access in AWS by creating policies and attaching them to AWS identities or resources. A policy defines permissions when associated with an identity or resource. AWS evaluates these policies when a principal makes a request. Most policies are stored in AWS as JSON documents. For more information about JSON policy documents, see [Overview of JSON policies](../../../IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.md#access_policies-json "../../../IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.md#access_policies-json") in the _IAM User Guide_.

Using policies, administrators specify who has access to what by defining which **principal** can perform **actions** on what **resources**, and under what **conditions**.

By default, users and roles have no permissions. An IAM administrator creates IAM policies and adds them to roles, which users can then assume. IAM policies define permissions regardless of the method used to perform the operation.

### Identity-based

policies

Identity-based policies are JSON permissions policy documents that you attach to an identity (user, group, or role). These policies control what actions identities can perform, on which resources, and under what conditions. To learn how to create an identity-based policy, see [Define custom IAM permissions with customer managed policies](../../../IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_create.md "../../../IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_create.md") in the _IAM User Guide_.

Identity-based policies can be _inline policies_ (embedded directly into a single identity) or _managed policies_ (standalone policies attached to multiple identities). To learn how to choose between managed and inline policies, see [Choose between managed policies and inline policies](../../../IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies-choosing-managed-or-inline.md "../../../IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies-choosing-managed-or-inline.md") in the _IAM User Guide_.

### Resource-based

policies

Resource-based policies are JSON policy documents that you attach to a resource. Examples include IAM _role trust policies_ and Amazon S3 _bucket policies_. In services that support resource-based policies, service administrators can use them to control access to a specific resource. You must [specify a principal](../../../IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_elements_principal.md "../../../IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_elements_principal.md") in a resource-based policy.

Resource-based policies are inline policies that are located in that service. You can't use AWS managed policies from IAM in a resource-based policy.

### Access control lists (ACLs)

Access control lists (ACLs) control which principals (account members, users, or roles) have permissions to access a resource. ACLs are
similar to resource-based policies, although they do not use the JSON policy document format.

Amazon S3, AWS WAF, and Amazon VPC
are examples of services that support ACLs. To learn more about ACLs, see [Access control list (ACL)
overview](../../../AmazonS3/latest/userguide/acl-overview.md "../../../AmazonS3/latest/userguide/acl-overview.md") in the _Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide_.

### Other policy types

AWS supports additional policy types that can set the maximum permissions granted by more common policy types:

- **Permissions boundaries** – Set the maximum permissions that an identity-based policy can grant to an IAM entity. For more information, see [Permissions boundaries for IAM entities](../../../IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_boundaries.md "../../../IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_boundaries.md") in the _IAM User Guide_.
- **Service control policies (SCPs)** – Specify the maximum permissions for an organization or organizational unit in AWS Organizations. For more information, see [Service control policies](../../../organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_policies_scps.md "../../../organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_policies_scps.md") in the _AWS Organizations User Guide_.
- **Resource control policies (RCPs)** – Set the maximum available permissions for resources in your accounts. For more information, see [Resource control policies (RCPs)](../../../organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_policies_rcps.md "../../../organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_policies_rcps.md") in the _AWS Organizations User Guide_.
- **Session policies** – Advanced policies passed as a parameter when creating a temporary session for a role or federated user. For more information, see [Session policies](../../../IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.md#policies_session "../../../IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.md#policies_session") in the _IAM User Guide_.

### Multiple policy types

When multiple types of policies apply to a request, the resulting permissions are more complicated to understand. To learn how AWS determines whether to allow a request when multiple policy types are involved, see [Policy evaluation logic](../../../IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_evaluation-logic.md "../../../IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_evaluation-logic.md") in the _IAM User Guide_.

## Troubleshooting AWS identity and

access

Use the following information to help you diagnose and fix common issues that you might
encounter when working with AWS and IAM.

###### Topics

- [I am not authorized to perform an
  action in AWS](#security_iam_troubleshoot-no-permissions "#security_iam_troubleshoot-no-permissions")
- [I am not authorized to perform
  iam:PassRole](#security_iam_troubleshoot-passrole "#security_iam_troubleshoot-passrole")
- [I want to allow people
  outside of my AWS account to access my AWS resources](#security_iam_troubleshoot-cross-account-access "#security_iam_troubleshoot-cross-account-access")

### I am not authorized to perform an

action in AWS

If you receive an error that you're not authorized to perform an action, your
policies must be updated to allow you to perform the action.

The following example error occurs when the `mateojackson` IAM user
tries to use the console to view details about a fictional
`my-example-widget` resource but doesn't
have the fictional `awes:`GetWidget`` permissions.

```
User: arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/mateojackson is not authorized to perform: awes:GetWidget on resource: my-example-widget
```

In this case, the policy for the `mateojackson` user must be updated to allow access to the
`my-example-widget` resource by using the
`awes:`GetWidget`` action.

If you need help, contact your AWS administrator. Your administrator is the person who provided you with your sign-in credentials.

### I am not authorized to perform

iam:PassRole

If you receive an error that you're not authorized to perform the `iam:PassRole` action, your policies must be updated to allow you to pass a role to AWS.

Some AWS services allow you to pass an existing role to that service instead of creating a new service role or service-linked role. To do
this, you must have permissions to pass the role to the service.

The following example error occurs when an IAM user named `marymajor` tries to use the console to perform an action in
AWS. However, the action requires the service to have permissions that are granted by a service role. Mary does not have permissions to pass the
role to the service.

```
User: arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/`marymajor` is not authorized to perform: iam:PassRole
```

In this case, Mary's policies must be updated to allow her to perform the `iam:PassRole` action.

If you need help, contact your AWS administrator. Your administrator is the person who provided you with your sign-in credentials.

### I want to allow people

outside of my AWS account to access my AWS resources

You can create a role that users in other accounts or people outside of your organization can use to access your resources. You can specify who
is trusted to assume the role. For services that support resource-based policies or access control lists (ACLs), you can use those policies to grant
people access to your resources.
