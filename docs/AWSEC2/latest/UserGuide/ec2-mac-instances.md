# Amazon EC2 Mac instances

EC2 Mac instances are ideal for developing, building, testing, and signing applications
for Apple platforms, such as iPhone, iPad, Mac, Vision Pro, Apple Watch, Apple TV, and
Safari. You can connect to your Mac instance using SSH or Apple Remote Desktop (ARD).

###### Note

The **unit of billing** is the **dedicated
host**. The instances running on that host have no additional
charge.

Amazon EC2 Mac instances natively support the macOS operating system.

  are built on 2023 Mac mini hardware powered by Apple silicon M2 Pro processor, 12 CPU
  cores, 19 GPU cores, 32 GiB of memory, and the 16-core Apple Neural Engine.
- **EC2 M4 Mac instances** (`mac-m4.metal`) are
  built on 2024 Mac mini hardware powered by Apple silicon M4 processor, 10 CPU cores, 10
  GPU cores, 24 GiB of memory, and the 16-core Apple Neural Engine.
- **EC2 M4 Pro Mac Mac instances** (`mac-m4pro.metal`)
  are built on 2024 Mac mini hardware powered by Apple silicon M4 Pro processor, 14 CPU
  cores, 20 GPU cores, 48 GiB of memory, and the 16-core Apple Neural Engine.
  Amazon EC2 Mac Dedicated Hosts support [Dedicated Host auto recovery](dedicated-hosts-recovery.md "dedicated-hosts-recovery.md") and

## Considerations

The following considerations apply to Mac instances:

- Mac instances are available only as bare metal instances on [Dedicated Hosts](dedicated-hosts-overview.md "dedicated-hosts-overview.md"), with a
  minimum allocation period of 24 hours before you can release the Dedicated Host. You can
  launch one Mac instance per Dedicated Host. You can share the Dedicated Host with the AWS accounts
  or organizational units within your AWS organization, or the entire AWS
  organization.
- Mac instances are available in different AWS Regions. For a list of Mac instance availability in each of the AWS Regions, see [Amazon EC2 instance types by Region](../../../ec2/latest/instancetypes/ec2-instance-regions.md "../../../ec2/latest/instancetypes/ec2-instance-regions.md").
- Mac instances are available only as On-Demand Instances. They are not available as Spot Instances or
  Reserved Instances. You can save money on Mac instances by purchasing a [Savings Plan](../../../savingsplans/latest/userguide.md "../../../savingsplans/latest/userguide.md").
- The compatibility of different Mac instance types with specific macOS Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) varies. For more information, see [Amazon EC2 macOS AMIs release notes](macos-ami-overview.md "macos-ami-overview.md").
- EBS hotplug is supported.
- AWS does not manage or support the internal SSD on the Apple hardware. We
  strongly recommend that you use Amazon EBS volumes instead. EBS volumes provide the
  same elasticity, availability, and durability benefits on Mac instances as they
  do on any other EC2 instance.
- We recommend using an Amazon EBS volume with 10,000 IOPS and 400 MiB/s throughput
  with Mac instances for optimal performance. For more information, see [Amazon EBS volume types](../../../ebs/latest/userguide/ebs-volume-types.md "../../../ebs/latest/userguide/ebs-volume-types.md") in the _Amazon EBS User Guide_.
- [Mac instances
  support Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling.](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/implementing-autoscaling-for-ec2-mac-instances/ "https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/implementing-autoscaling-for-ec2-mac-instances/")
- On x86 Mac instances, automatic software updates are disabled. We recommend
  that you apply updates and test them on your instance before you put the
  instance into production. For more information, see [Update the operating system and software on Amazon EC2 Mac instances](mac-instance-updates.md "mac-instance-updates.md").
- When you stop or terminate a Mac instance, a scrubbing workflow is performed
  on the Dedicated Host. For more information, see [Stop or terminate your Amazon EC2 Mac instance](mac-instance-stop.md "mac-instance-stop.md").
- ###### Important

Apple Intelligence features are not available when booting Mac hardware from
an external volume. As EC2 Mac instances boot from external EBS volumes by default,
they do not support Apple Intelligence features.

- ###### Warning

Do not use FileVault. If you enable FileVault, the host fails to boot
because the partitions are locked. If data encryption is required, use
Amazon EBS encryption to avoid boot issues and performance impact. With Amazon EBS encryption,
encryption operations occur on the host servers, ensuring the security
of both data-at-rest and data-in-transit between the instances and their
attached EBS storage. For more information, see [Amazon EBS encryption](../../../ebs/latest/userguide/ebs-encryption.md "../../../ebs/latest/userguide/ebs-encryption.md") in the
_Amazon EBS User Guide_.

## Instance readiness

After you launch a Mac instance, you'll need to wait until the instance is ready
before you can connect to it. For an AWS vended AMI with a x86 Mac instance or a
Apple silicon Mac instance, the launch time can range from approximately 6 minutes to 20
minutes. Depending on the chosen Amazon EBS volume sizes, the inclusion of additional scripts
to _user data_, or additional loaded software on a custom macOS
AMI, the launch time might increase.

You can use a small shell script, like the one below, to poll the
describe-instance-status API to know when the instance is ready to be connected to. In
the following command, replace the example instance ID with your own.

```
for i in $(seq 1 200); do aws ec2 describe-instance-status --instance-ids=`i-1234567890abcdef0` \
    --query='InstanceStatuses[0].InstanceStatus.Status'; sleep 5; done;
```

## EC2 macOS AMIs

Amazon EC2 macOS is designed to provide a stable, secure, and high-performance environment
for developer workloads running on Amazon EC2 Mac instances. EC2 macOS AMIs includes
packages that enable easy integration with AWS, such as launch configuration tools and
popular AWS libraries and tools.

For more information about EC2 macOS AMIs, see [Amazon EC2 macOS AMIs release notes](macos-ami-overview.md "macos-ami-overview.md").

AWS provides updated EC2 macOS AMIs on a regular basis that include updates to
packages owned by AWS and the latest fully-tested macOS version. Additionally, AWS
provides updated AMIs with the latest minor version updates or major version
updates as soon as they can be fully tested and vetted. If you do not need to preserve
data or customizations to your Mac instances, you can get the latest updates by
launching a new instance using the current AMI and then terminating the previous
instance. Otherwise, you can choose which updates to apply to your Mac instances.

For information about how to subscribe to macOS AMI notifications, see [Subscribe to macOS AMI notifications](macos-subscribe-notifications.md "macos-subscribe-notifications.md").

## EC2 macOS Init

EC2 macOS Init is used to initialize EC2 Mac instances at launch. It uses priority groups
to run logical groups of tasks at the same time.

The launchd plist file is `/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.amazon.ec2.macos-init.plist`.
The files for EC2 macOS Init are located in `/usr/local/aws/ec2-macos-init`.

For more information, see [https://github.com/aws/ec2-macos-init](https://github.com/aws/ec2-macos-init "https://github.com/aws/ec2-macos-init").

## Amazon EC2 System Monitor for macOS

Amazon EC2 System Monitor for macOS provides CPU utilization metrics to Amazon CloudWatch.
It sends these metrics to CloudWatch over a custom serial device in 1-minute periods.
You can enable or disable this agent as follows. It is enabled by default.

```
sudo setup-ec2monitoring [enable | disable]
```

###### Note

Amazon EC2 System Monitor for macOS is not currently supported on Apple silicon Mac
instances.
