# Search for code, issues, projects, and users in CodeCatalyst

Use the search bar or a dedicated search results window in CodeCatalyst to search through code,
issues, projects, and users CodeCatalyst.

You can find resources across your space and projects by entering queries such as
name, description, and status into the search bar. You can also refine your search queries using
the search query language.

- [Considerations when working with search](#search-tips-troubleshooting "#search-tips-troubleshooting")
- [Searchable fields reference](#search-query-language-searchable-fields "#search-query-language-searchable-fields")

###### To search

1. In the search bar in the top navigation bar, enter a search query.
2. (Optional) Refine your search query using CodeCatalyst's search query language. For more
   information, see [Refining your search query](#search-query-language-examples "#search-query-language-examples").
3. Do one of the following:
   - To search for resources within the project that you are currently in, choose
     **This project**.
   - To search for resources within all of the projects in the space you are currently
     in, choose **This space**.

4. View search results in a dedicated search results window by doing one of the
   following:
   - In the bottom of the quick search results window, choose **View all results in
     project-name | space-name** to view all search results.
   - Press **Enter** to view all search results.

###### Tip

Mention other project users in a pull request comment or description, or in an issue comment
or description, by using the @ sign followed by their display name or user name. You can also
link to resources like issues or code files by using the @ sign followed by the name of the issue
or code file.

## Refining your search query

If you can't find what you're looking for after searching, you can refine your search with
CodeCatalyst's specialized query language. Individual fields have no character limit, but the overall
query has a limit of 1,024 characters.

###### Topics

- [Refining by type](#search-query-language-type-search "#search-query-language-type-search")
- [Refining by field](#search-query-language-field-search "#search-query-language-field-search")
- [Refining with Boolean operators](#search-query-language-boolean-search "#search-query-language-boolean-search")
- [Refining by project](#search-query-language-project-search "#search-query-language-project-search")

### Refining by type

To refine the scope of your search to a specific type of information, include
`type:result-type` in your search, where
`result-type` is `code`, `issue`, `project`, or
`user` .

Examples:

- `type:code AND java` – Show code results in code-related fields that
  contain “java”.

For more information, see [Code fields](#search-query-language-type-code "#search-query-language-type-code").

- `type:issue AND Bug` – Show issue results in issue-related fields that
  contain “Bug”.

For more information, see [Issue fields](#search-query-language-type-issue "#search-query-language-type-issue").

- `type:user AND MaryMajor` – Show user results in user-related fields
  that contain “MaryMajor”.

For more information, see [User fields](#search-query-language-type-user "#search-query-language-type-user").

- `type:project AND Datafeeder` – Show project results that contain
  "Datafeeder".

For more information, see [Project fields](#search-query-language-type-project "#search-query-language-type-project").

### Refining by field

To refine the scope of your search to a specific field, include
`field-name:query` in your search, where
`field-name` is `title`, `username`,
`project`, `description`, and so on, and `query`
is the text for which you are searching. For a list of fields, see [Searchable fields reference](#search-query-language-searchable-fields "#search-query-language-searchable-fields"). You can search for multiple queries
using parentheses.

Examples:

- `title:bug` – Show results where the title contains “bug”.
- `username:John` – Show results where the user name contains
  “John”.
- `project:DataFeeder` – Show results in the project “DataFeeder”. Query
  isn't case sensitive.
- `description:overview` – Show results where the description
  contains “overview”.

### Refining with Boolean operators

To specify constraints on search phrases, you can use the Boolean operators
`AND`, `OR`, and `NOT`. If you list multiple phrases, CodeCatalyst
joins them with `OR` by default. You can group search phrases using
parentheses.

- `exception AND type:code` – Show only code results for
  “exception”.
- `path:README.md AND repo:ServerlessAPI` – Show results for paths with
  “README.md” where the repository is named “ServerlessAPI”.
- `buildspec.yml AND (repo:ServerlessAPI OR ServerlessWebApp)` – Show
  results for “buildspec.yml” where the repository is “ServerlessAPI” or
  “ServerlessWebApp”.
- `path:java NOT (path:py OR path:ts)` – Show results where the path contains
  “java” but not “py” or “ts”.

### Refining by project

To refine the scope of your search to a specific project, include
`project:name AND query` in your search, where
`name` is the project within which you are searching and
`query` is the content for which you are searching.

- `project:name AND query` – Show results where the path contains
  the query and the project name.

## Considerations when working with search

**Delayed content updates** – It can take several
minutes for content updates, such as name changes or issue reassignments, to be reflected in the
search results. Large updates, such as a code base migration, can take longer to appear in search
results.

**Escaping special characters** – The following special
characters require special consideration in your search queries: `+ - & & || ! ( ) { } [ ] 
 ^ " ~ * ? : \`. Special characters will not influence the query, and you must either remove
them or escape them. To escape a character, add a backslash (\) in front of it. For example, the
search query [Feature] should either be Feature or \[Feature\].

**Narrowing search** – Search isn't case sensitive.
Searching in all lowercase prevents your queries from splitting up words on case change. For
example, to query for `MyService` and only `MyService`, consider querying
`myservice` to avoid results that contain only `my` or
`service`.

Search joins words and parts of words with OR-wise conjunction by default. For example,
`new function` could return results containing both `new` and
`function` and also results with only `new` or `function`. To
avoid the latter, combine multiple words with `AND`. For example, you can search
`new AND function`.

**Default branches** – Search will only return code results
from the latest commit on a source repository’s default branch. To find code on other branches or
commits, consider [cloning the repository locally](source-repositories-clone.md "source-repositories-clone.md"),
[opening the branch in a Dev Environment](devenvironment-create.md "devenvironment-create.md"), or
[viewing the branches and details in the CodeCatalyst UI](source-branches-view.md "source-branches-view.md").
Changing the default branch results in updates to the files discoverable by search. For more information,
see [Managing the default branch for a
repository](source-branches-default-branch.md "source-branches-default-branch.md").

###### Important

CodeCatalyst doesn't support detecting changes in the default branch for linked
repositories. To change the default branch for a linked repository, you must first unlink it
from CodeCatalyst, change the default branch, and then link it again. For more information,
see [Linking GitHub repositories, Bitbucket repositories, GitLab project repositories,
and Jira projects in CodeCatalyst](extensions-link.md "extensions-link.md").

As a best practice, always make sure you have the latest version of the extension
before you link a repository.

## Searchable fields reference

CodeCatalyst searches the following fields when you enter search queries. Aliases are another name
that you can use to reference the field in the advanced query language.
