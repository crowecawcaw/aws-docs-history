# `ALTER STATISTICS`

## Supported syntax

```
ALTER STATISTICS name OWNER TO { new_owner | CURRENT_ROLE | CURRENT_USER | SESSION_USER }
ALTER STATISTICS name RENAME TO new_name
ALTER STATISTICS name SET SCHEMA new_schema
ALTER STATISTICS name SET STATISTICS { new_target | DEFAULT }
```

## Description

`ALTER STATISTICS` changes the parameters of an existing extended statistics
object. Any parameters not specifically set in the `ALTER STATISTICS` command
retain their prior settings.

You must own the statistics object to use `ALTER STATISTICS`. To change a
statistics object's schema, you must also have `CREATE` privilege on the new
schema. To alter the owner, you must be able to `SET ROLE` to the new owning role,
and that role must have `CREATE` privilege on the statistics object's schema.
(These restrictions enforce that altering the owner doesn't do anything you couldn't do by
dropping and recreating the statistics object. However, a superuser can alter ownership of any
statistics object anyway.)

## Parameters

**`name`**

The name (optionally schema-qualified) of the statistics object to be
altered.

**`new_owner`**

The user name of the new owner of the statistics object.

**`new_name`**

The new name for the statistics object.

**`new_schema`**

The new schema for the statistics object.

**`new_target`**

The statistic-gathering target for this statistics object for subsequent
`ANALYZE` operations. In Aurora DSQL, the target can be set in the range
`0` to `100`. Set it to `DEFAULT` to revert to using the
system default statistics target (`default_statistics_target`). (Setting it
to a value of `-1` is an obsolete spelling to get the same outcome.)

###### Important

If you set a target greater than `100`, Aurora DSQL returns the error
`statistics target N exceeds maximum allowed value of 100`.
