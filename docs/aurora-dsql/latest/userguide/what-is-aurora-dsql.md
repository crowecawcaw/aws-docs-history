# What is Amazon Aurora DSQL?

Amazon Aurora DSQL is a serverless, distributed relational database service optimized for
transactional workloads. Aurora DSQL offers virtually unlimited scale and doesn't require you to manage
infrastructure. The active-active highly available architecture provides 99.99% single-Region and
99.999% multi-Region availability.

## When to use Aurora DSQL

Aurora DSQL is optimized for transactional workloads that benefit from ACID transactions and a
relational data model. Because it's serverless, Aurora DSQL is ideal for application patterns of
microservice, serverless, and event-driven architectures. Aurora DSQL is PostgreSQL-compatible, so you
can use familiar drivers, object-relational mappings (ORMs), frameworks, and SQL features.

Aurora DSQL automatically manages system infrastructure and scales compute, I/O, and storage
based on your workload. Because you have no servers to provision or manage, you don't have to
worry about maintenance downtime related to provisioning, patching, or infrastructure
upgrades.

Aurora DSQL helps you to build and maintain enterprise applications that are always available at
any scale. The active-active serverless design automates failure recovery, so you don't need to
worry about traditional database failover. Your applications benefit from Multi-AZ and
multi-Region availability, and you don't have to be concerned about eventual consistency or
missing data related to failovers.

## Key features in Aurora DSQL

The following key features help you create a serverless distributed database to support your
high-availability applications:

**Distributed architecture**

Aurora DSQL is composed of the following multi-tenant components:

- Relay and connectivity
- Compute and databases
- Transaction log, concurrency control, and isolation
- Storage

A control plane coordinates the preceding components. Each component provide redundancy
across three Availability Zones (AZs), with automatic cluster scaling and self-healing in case
of component failures. To learn more about how this architecture supports high availability,
see [Resilience in Amazon Aurora DSQL](disaster-recovery-resiliency.md "disaster-recovery-resiliency.md").

**Single-Region and multi-Region clusters**

Aurora DSQL clusters provide the following benefits:

- Synchronous data replication
- Consistent read operations
- Automatic failure recovery
- Data consistency across multiple AZs or Regions

If an infrastructure component fails, Aurora DSQL automatically routes requests to healthy
infrastructure without manual intervention. Aurora DSQL provides _atomicity,
consistency, isolation, and durability (ACID) transactions_ with strong
consistency, snapshot isolation, atomicity, and cross-AZ and cross-Region durability.

Multi-Region peered clusters provide the same resilience and connectivity as
single-Region clusters. But they improve availability by offering two Regional endpoints, one
in each peered cluster Region. Both endpoints of a peered
cluster present a single logical database. They are available for concurrent read and write
operations, and provide strong data consistency. You can build applications that run in
multiple Regions at the same time for performance and resilience—and know that readers
always see the same data.

**Compatibility with PostgreSQL databases**

The distributed database layer (compute) in Aurora DSQL is based on a current major version of
PostgreSQL. You can connect to Aurora DSQL with familiar PostgreSQL drivers and tools, such as
`psql`. Aurora DSQL is currently compatible with PostgreSQL version 16 and supports a
subset of PostgreSQL features, expressions, and data types. For more information about the
supported SQL features, see [SQL feature compatibility in
Aurora DSQL](working-with-postgresql-compatibility.md "working-with-postgresql-compatibility.md").

## Region availability for Aurora DSQL

With Amazon Aurora DSQL, you can deploy database instances across multiple AWS Regions to
support global applications and meet data residency requirements. Region availability
determines where you can create and manage Aurora DSQL database clusters. Database administrators
and application architects who need to design highly available, globally distributed
database systems often need to understand Region support for their workloads. Common use
cases include setting up cross-Region disaster recovery, serving users from geographically
closer database instances to reduce latency, and maintaining data copies in specific
locations for compliance.

The following table shows the AWS Regions where Aurora DSQL is currently available and the
endpoint for each AWS Region.

Each Region set groups geographically related Regions that can work together in a multi-Region cluster. #### US Regions <br>• US East (N. Virginia) <br>• US East (Ohio) <br>• US West (Oregon) #### Asia Pacific Regions <br>• Asia Pacific (Osaka) <br>• Asia Pacific (Seoul) <br>• Asia Pacific (Tokyo) #### European Regions <br>• Europe (Frankfurt) <br>• Europe (Ireland) <br>• Europe (London) <br>• Europe (Paris) #### Important Limitations Multi-Region clusters must be created within a single Region set. For example, you can't create a cluster that includes both US East (N. Virginia) and Europe (Ireland) Regions. ###### Important Aurora DSQL currently doesn't support cross-continent multi-Region clusters. ## Pricing for Aurora DSQL For cost information, see [Aurora DSQL pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora/dsql/pricing/ "https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora/dsql/pricing/"). ## What's next?
