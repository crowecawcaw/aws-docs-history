# Query Editors: Using JupyterLab with Aurora DSQL

This guide provides step-by-step instructions on how to connect and
query Amazon Aurora DSQL using JupyterLab with Python. JupyterLab is
a popular interactive computing environment that combines code,
text, and visualizations in a single document. It’s widely used for
data science and research applications.

The instructions below will cover the basics of Aurora DSQL usage in
both a local installation of JupyterLab as well as using Amazon
SageMaker AI, a fully-managed machine learning service that provides
a hosted environment with a UI for data workflows.

## Getting started

### Requirements

- An Aurora DSQL cluster
- AWS credentials configured (local installation only)
- Python version 3.9 or greater (local installation only)

### Using local JupyterLab

To get started with JupyterLab, users must first install the
application using Python’s **pip**:

```
pip install jupyterlab
```

JupyterLab can then be opened by running
`jupyter lab`. This will open the JupyterLab
application at localhost:8888, accessible in a browser. Ensure
you have AWS credentials configured in your local environment
before proceeding.

### Using Amazon SageMaker AI

In the AWS console, proceed to the Amazon SageMaker AI console
page and then to the **Notebooks** section under **Applications and
IDEs**. From there you can select **Create notebook instance** to
begin creating a SageMaker environment. Select an instance type
and platform before clicking **Create notebook instance**.

See
[Amazon
SageMaker AI setup documentation](../../../sagemaker/latest/dg/gs-setup-working-env.md "../../../sagemaker/latest/dg/gs-setup-working-env.md") for more information on
setup and instance options.

###### Note

Warning: Using Amazon SageMaker AI may result in charges to your AWS account.

Once the SageMaker instance becomes active, you can open it from
the **Notebook instances** section with **Open JupyterLab**. Before
getting started with Aurora DSQL in your notebook you must
provide access to your DSQL cluster in the SageMaker instance’s
IAM role. The simplest way to do so is to follow the link to the
IAM role in the notebook instance page. From there you can edit
the Policies attached to your SageMaker IAM role. See
[Authentication
and authorization](authentication-authorization.md "authentication-authorization.md") for more information on configuring an
IAM policy to allow access to Aurora DSQL.

### Connecting to Aurora DSQL using JupyterLab

After you have set up a JupyterLab instance, the steps to connect
to Aurora DSQL are the same locally and in SageMaker AI. Create an
empty Python 3 notebook, in which you can add cells with Python
code.

In a Python cell, download the Amazon root certificate from the official trust store:

```
import urllib.request
urllib.request.urlretrieve('https://www.amazontrust.com/repository/AmazonRootCA1.pem', 'root.pem')

```

To connect to Aurora DSQL, first install the
[Aurora
DSQL Connector for Python](https://github.com/awslabs/aurora-dsql-python-connector "https://github.com/awslabs/aurora-dsql-python-connector") and the Psycopg driver in a Python
cell, and then import it:

```
pip install aurora_dsql_python_connector psycopg
```

```
import aurora_dsql_psycopg as dsql
```

With the connector imported, you can then create a DSQL
configuration and connect. The Aurora DSQL Python Connector will
automatically handle creation of an authentication token on each
connection.

```
config = {
    'host': "your-cluster.dsql.us-east-1.on.aws",
    'region': "us-east-1",
    'user': "admin"
    }

conn = dsql.connect(**config)
```

Upon running your code you should now have a Psycopg connection
to Aurora DSQL. You can then run queries using the Psycopg
cursor and providing your SQL query. See the
[Psycopg
documentation](https://www.psycopg.org/psycopg3/docs/ "https://www.psycopg.org/psycopg3/docs/") for more information on using Psycopg with
a Postgres-compatible database. This query will result in a list
of tuples in `results_list`.

```
with conn:
    with conn.cursor() as cur:
        cur.execute("SELECT * FROM table")
        results_list = cur.fetchall()
```

You can then use Python frameworks like
[Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/ "https://pandas.pydata.org/") to
analyze or visualize your query results, for example:

```
pip install pandas

import pandas as pd

df = pd.DataFrame(tuples_list)
print(df)
print(f"Total records: {len(df)}")
```

## Example notebook

[A
sample notebook using Aurora DSQL is available in the Aurora DSQL
samples repository.](https://github.com/aws-samples/aurora-dsql-samples/tree/main/python/jupyter/sample.ipynb "https://github.com/aws-samples/aurora-dsql-samples/tree/main/python/jupyter/sample.ipynb")
