## Asset

An _asset_ is an individual file stored in CodeArtifact that's associated
with a package version, such as an npm `.tgz` file or Maven POM and JAR
files.

## Domain

Repositories are aggregated into a higher-level entity known as a
_domain_. All package assets and metadata are stored in the
domain, but they are consumed through repositories. A given package asset, such as a
Maven JAR file, is stored once per domain, no matter how many repositories it's present
in. All of the assets and metadata in a domain are encrypted with the same
AWS KMS key (KMS key) stored in AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS).

Each repository is a member of a single domain and can't be moved to a different
domain.

Using a domain, you can apply an organizational policy across multiple repositories.
With this approach, you determine which accounts can access repositories in the domain,
and which public repositories can be used as the sources of packages.

Although an organization can have multiple domains, we recommend a single production
domain that contains all published artifacts. That way, teams can find and share
packages across your organization.

## Repository

A CodeArtifact _repository_ contains a set of [package versions](#welcome-concepts-package-version "#welcome-concepts-package-version"), each of which
maps to a set of [assets](#welcome-concepts-asset "#welcome-concepts-asset"). Repositories are
polyglot—a single repository can contain packages of any supported type. Each repository
exposes endpoints for fetching and publishing packages using tools like the nuget CLI,
the npm CLI, the Maven CLI (mvn), and pip. You can create up to 1,000 repositories per
domain.

## Package

A _package_ is a bundle of software and the metadata that is
required to resolve dependencies and install the software. In CodeArtifact, a package consists of a package name,
an optional [namespace](#welcome-concepts-package-namespace "#welcome-concepts-package-namespace") such as `@types`
in `@types/node`, a
set of package versions, and package-level metadata such as npm tags.

AWS CodeArtifact supports [Cargo](using-cargo.md "using-cargo.md"),
[generic](using-generic.md "using-generic.md"),
[Maven](using-maven.md "using-maven.md"),
[npm](using-npm.md "using-npm.md"),
[NuGet](using-nuget.md "using-nuget.md"),
[PyPI](using-python.md "using-python.md"),
[Ruby](using-ruby.md "using-ruby.md"),
[Swift](using-swift.md "using-swift.md") package formats.

## Package group

_Package groups_ can be used to apply configuration to multiple packages that match a defined pattern using
package format, package namespace, and package name. You can use package groups to more conveniently
configure package origin controls for multiple packages. Package origin controls are used to block or allow ingestion or publishing
of new package versions, which protects users from malicious actions known as dependency substitution attacks.

## Package namespace

Some package formats support hierarchical package names to organize packages into
logical groups and help avoid name collisions. For example, npm supports scopes. For
more information, see the [npm
scopes documentation](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/using-npm/scope "https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/using-npm/scope"). The npm package `@types/node` has a scope of
`@types` and a name of `node`. There are many other package
names in the `@types` scope. In CodeArtifact, the scope (“types”) is referred to as
the package namespace and the name (“node”) is referred to as the package name. For
Maven packages, the package namespace corresponds to the Maven groupID. The Maven
package `org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j` has a groupID (package namespace) of
`org.apache.logging.log4j` and the artifactID (package name)
`log4j`. For generic packages, a [namespace](../APIReference/API_PublishPackageVersion.md#namespace "../APIReference/API_PublishPackageVersion.md#namespace") is required. Some package formats such as PyPI don't support
hierarchical names with a concept similar to npm scope or Maven groupID. Without a way
to group package names, it can be more difficult to avoid name collisions.

## Package version

A _package version_ identifies the specific version of a package,
such as `@types/node 12.6.9`. The version number format and semantics vary
for different package formats. For example, npm package versions must conform to the
[Semantic Versioning specification](https://semver.org/ "https://semver.org/"). In CodeArtifact,
a package version consists of the version identifier, package version level metadata,
and a set of assets.

## Package version

revision

A _package version revision_ is a string that identifies a
specific set of assets and metadata for a package version. Each time a package version
is updated, a new package version revision is created. For example, you might publish a
source distribution archive (**sdist**) for a Python
package version, and later add a Python **wheel** that
contains compiled code to the same version. When you publish the **wheel**, a new package version revision is created.

## Upstream repository

One repository is _upstream_ of another when the package versions
in it can be accessed from the repository endpoint of the downstream repository. This
approach effectively merges the contents of the two repositories from the point of view
of a client. Using CodeArtifact, you can create an upstream relationship between two
repositories.
