# Dual Stack Amazon VPC Connectivity with AWS Transit Gateway

Publication date: **June 23, 2022 ([Diagram history](#ipv6-13-diagram-history "#ipv6-13-diagram-history"))**

This architecture shows how to build global dual stack Amazon VPC connectivity with [AWS Transit Gateway](../../../vpc/latest/tgw/what-is-transit-gateway.md "../../../vpc/latest/tgw/what-is-transit-gateway.md"), including cross-Region peering with dual stack support.

## Dual Stack Amazon VPC Connectivity with AWS Transit Gateway architecture

![Architecture diagram showing dual stack connectivity with aws transit gateway.](images/ipv6-vpc-architectures-13.png)

The following numbered items describe the key components in this architecture:

1. When you attach a [Amazon VPC](../../../vpc/latest/userguide/what-is-amazon-vpc.md "../../../vpc/latest/userguide/what-is-amazon-vpc.md") to an AWS Transit Gateway, you must specify one subnet from each Availability Zone to be used by the Transit Gateway to route traffic. For dual stack support, the Transit Gateway attachment subnets must have IPv6 CIDR blocks associated, and the attachment must be enabled for IPv6 routing.
2. Transit Gateway peering connections natively support dual stack routing.
3. Update the Amazon VPC route tables with the necessary IPv4 and IPv6 routes.
4. If propagation is enabled for the Amazon VPC attachments to the transit gateway, the Transit Gateway route tables will be populated with both IPv4 and IPv6 Amazon VPC CIDR blocks.
