**Version:** 2.08.4

Aurora MySQL 2.08.4 is generally available. Aurora MySQL 2.x versions are compatible with MySQL 5.7 and Aurora MySQL 1.x versions are compatible with MySQL 5.6.

 You can upgrade an existing Aurora MySQL 2.\* database cluster to Aurora MySQL 2.10.0. For clusters running Aurora MySQL version 1, you can upgrade an existing Aurora MySQL 1.23 or higher cluster directly to 2.10.0. You can also restore a snapshot from any currently supported Aurora MySQL release into Aurora MySQL 2.10.0. 

 To create a cluster with an older version of Aurora MySQL, specify the engine version through the AWS Management Console, the AWS CLI, or the Amazon RDS API. 

 If you have any questions or concerns, AWS Support is available on the community forums and through [AWS Support](https://aws.amazon.com/support).

## Improvements
<a name="AuroraMySQL.Updates.2084.Improvements"></a>

 **Security fixes and general improvements:** 
+ Fixed security issues related to Aurora MySQL integration with other AWS Services such as Amazon S3, Amazon ML, and AWS Lambda.
+ Fixed an issue where the value of a TIMESTAMP column of an existing row is updated to the latest timestamp when all of the following conditions are satisfied: 1. a trigger exists for the table; 2. an INSERT is performed on the table that has an ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE clause; 3. the inserted row can cause a duplicate value violation in a UNIQUE index or PRIMARY KEY; and 4. one or more columns are of TIMESTAMP data type and have a default value of CURRENT\_TIMESTAMP.
+ Fixed an issue which, in rare conditions, causes a writer instance to restart when an in-memory data-integrity check fails.
+ Fixed an issue with parallel query which could cause the database to restart when executing SQL statements with a LIMIT clause.

## MySQL 5.7 compatibility
<a name="AuroraMySQL.Updates.2084.Compatibility"></a>

This Aurora MySQL version is wire-compatible with MySQL 5.7 and includes features such as JSON support, spatial indexes, and generated columns. Aurora MySQL uses a native implementation of spatial indexing using z-order curves to deliver >20x better write performance and >10x better read performance than MySQL 5.7 for spatial datasets.

This Aurora MySQL version does not currently support the following MySQL 5.7 features:
+ Group replication plugin
+ Increased page size
+ InnoDB buffer pool loading at startup
+ InnoDB full-text parser plugin
+ Multisource replication
+ Online buffer pool resizing
+ Password validation plugin
