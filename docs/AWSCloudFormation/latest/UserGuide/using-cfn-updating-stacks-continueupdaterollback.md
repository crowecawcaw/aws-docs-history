# Continue rolling back an update
<a name="using-cfn-updating-stacks-continueupdaterollback"></a>

Sometimes, when CloudFormation tries to roll back a stack update, it can't roll back all the changes it made during the update process. This is called the `UPDATE_ROLLBACK_FAILED` state. For example, you might have a stack that begins to roll back to an old database instance that was deleted outside of CloudFormation. Because CloudFormation doesn't know that the database was deleted, it assumes that the database instance still exists and attempts to roll back to it, causing the update rollback to fail.

A stack in the `UPDATE_ROLLBACK_FAILED` state can't be updated, but it can be rolled back to a working state (`UPDATE_ROLLBACK_COMPLETE`). After returning the stack to its original settings, you can try to update it again.

In most cases, you must fix the error that causes the update rollback to fail before you can continue to roll back your stack. In other cases, you can continue to roll back the update without any changes, for example when a stack operation times out.

If you can't fix the error, you can force the rollback to complete. CloudFormation skips each resource that fails to roll back and returns the stack to `UPDATE_ROLLBACK_COMPLETE`. For more information, see [Force a rollback to complete](#continue-update-rollback-force-rollback).

**Note**  
If you use nested stacks, rolling back the parent stack will attempt to roll back all the child stacks as well.

**To continue rolling back an update (console)**

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the CloudFormation console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/).

1. On the navigation bar at the top of the screen, choose the AWS Region where the stack is located.

1. On the **Stacks** page, choose the stack that you want to update, choose **Stack actions**, and then choose **Continue update rollback**.

   If none of the solutions in the [Troubleshooting errors](troubleshooting.md#troubleshooting-errors) worked, you can use the advanced option to skip the resources that CloudFormation can't successfully roll back. You must [look up](cfn-console-view-stack-data-resources.md) and type the logical IDs of the resources that you want to skip. Specify only resources that went into the `UPDATE_FAILED` state during the `UpdateRollback` and not during the forward update.
**Warning**  
CloudFormation sets the status of the specified resources to `UPDATE_COMPLETE` and continues to roll back the stack. After the rollback is complete, the state of the skipped resources will be inconsistent with the state of the resources in the stack template. Before performing another stack update, you must update the stack or resources to be consistent with each other. If you don't, subsequent stack updates might fail, and the stack will become unrecoverable.

   Specify the minimum number of resources required to successfully roll back your stack. For example, a failed resource update might cause dependent resources to fail. In this case, it might not be necessary to skip the dependent resources.

   To skip resources that are part of nested stacks, use the following format: `{{NestedStackName}}.{{ResourceLogicalID}}`. If you want to specify the logical ID of a stack resource (`Type: AWS::CloudFormation::Stack`) in the `ResourcesToSkip` list, then its corresponding embedded stack must be in one of the following states: `DELETE_IN_PROGRESS`, `DELETE_COMPLETE`, or `DELETE_FAILED`.

**To continue rolling back an update (AWS CLI)**
+ Use the [continue-update-rollback](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/cloudformation/continue-update-rollback.html) command with the `--stack-name` option to specify the ID of the stack that you want to continue to roll back.

  To force the rollback to complete, add the `--force-rollback` option. For more information, see [Force a rollback to complete](#continue-update-rollback-force-rollback).

## Force a rollback to complete
<a name="continue-update-rollback-force-rollback"></a>

Use force rollback when you can't fix the error that causes the update rollback to fail. Instead of looking up and listing each resource in `--resources-to-skip`, you let CloudFormation skip the resources that fail to roll back.

When you force a rollback, CloudFormation continues rolling back the stack. CloudFormation skips each resource that is in the `UPDATE_FAILED` state because a rollback failed, including resources in nested stacks. CloudFormation sets the status of each skipped resource to `UPDATE_COMPLETE` with the status reason `Resource skipped during UpdateRollback`. When the rollback completes, the stack status reason reports that one or more resources were skipped.

CloudFormation skips only resources whose rollback failed. Resources that failed during the forward update aren't skipped.

The following **continue-update-rollback** example forces the rollback of the `{{MyStack}}` stack to complete.

```
aws cloudformation continue-update-rollback --stack-name {{MyStack}} \
    --force-rollback
```

You can't use `--force-rollback` and `--resources-to-skip` in the same request. To skip only a specific set of resources, use `--resources-to-skip` without `--force-rollback`.

**Warning**  
After the rollback completes, the skipped resources no longer match the resources in the stack template. Before you perform another stack update, you must update the stack or resources to be consistent with each other. If you don't, subsequent stack updates might fail, and the stack will become unrecoverable.

Drift detection reports skipped resources as `NOT_CHECKED`. To find out whether a skipped resource differs from the template, run [DetectStackResourceDrift](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/APIReference/API_DetectStackResourceDrift.html) on the resource.

## Continue rolling back from failed nested stack updates
<a name="nested-stacks"></a>

When you have multiple stacks nested within each other, you may need to skip resources across multiple nested levels to get the full stack hierarchy back to a working state. 

For example, you have a root stack called `WebInfra` that contains two smaller stacks inside it: `WebInfra-Compute` and `WebInfra-Storage`. These two stacks also have their own nested stacks within them.

If something goes wrong during an update, and the update process fails, the entire stack hierarchy may end up in the `UPDATE_ROLLBACK_FAILED` state, as shown in the following diagram. 

![A diagram showing a three-level nested stack hierarchy.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/images/cfn-update-stack-continue-update-rollback_nested-stacks.png)


**Note**  
The stack names in this example are truncated for simplicity. Child stack names are typically generated by CloudFormation and contain unique random strings, so actual names might not be user-friendly.

To get the root stack into an operable state using the `continue-update-rollback` command, you must skip the resources that failed to roll back. You can either use the `--force-rollback` option to skip them across all nested levels, or use the `--resources-to-skip` option to list them.

The following **continue-update-rollback** example forces the rollback of the whole hierarchy to complete. You don't need to find the nested stack names or logical IDs.

```
aws cloudformation continue-update-rollback --stack-name {{WebInfra}} \
    --force-rollback
```

The following **continue-update-rollback** example resumes a rollback operation from a previously failed stack update. In this example, the `--resources-to-skip` option includes the following items:
+ `{{myCustom}}`
+ `{{WebInfra-Compute-Asg.myAsg}}`
+ `{{WebInfra-Compute-LB.myLoadBalancer}}`
+ `{{WebInfra-Storage.DB}}`

For the resources of the root stack, you only need to provide the logical ID, for example, `{{myCustom}}`. However, for the resources that are contained in nested stacks, you must provide both the nested stack name and its logical ID, separated by a period. For example, `{{WebInfra-Compute-Asg.myAsg}}`.

```
aws cloudformation continue-update-rollback --stack-name {{WebInfra}} \
    --resources-to-skip {{myCustom WebInfra-Compute-Asg.myAsg WebInfra-Compute-LB.myLoadBalancer WebInfra-Storage.DB}}
```

**To find the stack name of a nested stack**  
You can locate it within the child stack's stack ID or Amazon Resource Name (ARN).

The following ARN example refers to a stack named `WebInfra-Storage-Z2VKC706XKXT`.

```
arn:aws:cloudformation:us-east-1:123456789012:stack/WebInfra-Storage-Z2VKC706XKXT/ea9e7f90-54f7-11e6-a032-028f3d2330bd
```

**To find the logical ID of a nested stack**  
You can find a child stack's logical ID in the template definition of its parent. In the diagram, the `LogicalId` of the `WebInfra-Storage-DB` child stack is `DB` in its parent `WebInfra-Storage`.

In the CloudFormation console, you can also find the logical ID in the **Logical ID** column for the stack resource on the **Resources** tab or the **Events** tab. For more information, see [View stack information from the CloudFormation console](cfn-console-view-stack-data-resources.md).

**Note**  
The `RollbackStack` operation also supports express mode. You can use `--deployment-config '{"mode": "EXPRESS"}'` with the **rollback-stack** command to roll back a failed stack faster. For more information, see [Express mode](cloudformation-express-mode.md).
