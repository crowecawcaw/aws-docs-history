# Step C: Downgrade the node
<a name="downgrades-lv-upg-dg-node"></a>

When you downgrade AWS Elemental Live , run the installer with the `--downgrade` switch for each node.

**To downgrade the node**

1. From the Linux prompt, log in with the *elemental* user credentials. Once you are logged in, the initial directory is `/home/elemental`.

1. Enter the following command. For example:

   ```
   [elemental@hostname ~]$ chmod 755 elemental_production_live_2.23.5.12345.run
   ```

1. Run the installer with the skip-all option. Use the following commands with the actual file name of the `.run` file, rather than the example below:
   + For GPU and CPU versions of the software:

     ```
     [elemental@hostname ~]$ sudo sh ./elemental_production_live_2.23.5.12345.run -c --skip-all --start -xeula --downgrade
     ```
   + For CPU-only versions of the software:

     ```
     [elemental@hostname ~]$ sudo sh ./elemental_production_live_cpu_2.23.5.12345.run -c --skip-all --start -xeula --downgrade
     ```

   Switches are as follows:
   + `2.23.5.12345`: Is the software version that you're downgrading to.
   + `-xeula`: Skips the prompts to read through the EULA. You are prompted once to accept it.
   + `--start`: Specifies to start the services without being prompted.
   + `--downgrade`: Tells the installer that an earlier version is being installed.
   + `--restore-db-backup <path>`: Installs the old version of the database backup file. Provide the path and file name in the following format: 

     ```
     /home/elemental/elemental-db-backup_{{<version>}}_{{<date>}}.tar
     ```

     Following our example, enter:

     ```
     /home/elemental/elemental-db-backup_2.23.5_2021-02-08_21-01-36.tar
     ```

1. Restart the node with the following command:

   ```
   [elemental@hostname ~] sudo reboot
   ```

   Repeat the downgrade steps on each worker node before moving on to the next step in the downgrade process.
