# SynthesizeSpeech

Synthesizes UTF-8 input, plain text or SSML, to a stream of bytes.
SSML input must be valid, well-formed SSML. Some alphabets might not be
available with all the voices (for example, Cyrillic might not be read at
all by English voices) unless phoneme mapping is used. For more
information, see [How it Works](how-text-to-speech-works.md "how-text-to-speech-works.md").

## URI Request Parameters

The request does not use any URI parameters.

## Request Body

The request accepts the following data in JSON format.

**[Engine](#API_SynthesizeSpeech_RequestSyntax "#API_SynthesizeSpeech_RequestSyntax")**

Specifies the engine (`standard`, `neural`,
`long-form`, or `generative`) for Amazon Polly
to use when processing input text for speech synthesis. Provide an engine
that is supported by the voice you select. If you don't provide an engine,
the standard engine is selected by default. If a chosen voice isn't supported
by the standard engine, this will result in an error. For information on
Amazon Polly voices and which voices are available for each engine, see [Available Voices](voicelist.md "voicelist.md").

Type: String

Valid Values: `standard | neural | long-form | generative`

Required: No

**[LanguageCode](#API_SynthesizeSpeech_RequestSyntax "#API_SynthesizeSpeech_RequestSyntax")**

Optional language code for the Synthesize Speech request. This is only
necessary if using a bilingual voice, such as Aditi, which can be used for
either Indian English (en-IN) or Hindi (hi-IN).

If a bilingual voice is used and no language code is specified, Amazon Polly
uses the default language of the bilingual voice. The default language for
any voice is the one returned by the [DescribeVoices](API_DescribeVoices.md "API_DescribeVoices.md") operation for the `LanguageCode`
parameter. For example, if no language code is specified, Aditi will use
Indian English rather than Hindi.

Type: String

Valid Values: `arb | cmn-CN | cy-GB | da-DK | de-DE | en-AU | en-GB | en-GB-WLS | en-IN | en-US | es-ES | es-MX | es-US | fr-CA | fr-FR | is-IS | it-IT | ja-JP | hi-IN | ko-KR | nb-NO | nl-NL | pl-PL | pt-BR | pt-PT | ro-RO | ru-RU | sv-SE | tr-TR | en-NZ | en-ZA | ca-ES | de-AT | yue-CN | ar-AE | fi-FI | en-IE | nl-BE | fr-BE | cs-CZ | de-CH`

Required: No

**[LexiconNames](#API_SynthesizeSpeech_RequestSyntax "#API_SynthesizeSpeech_RequestSyntax")**

List of one or more pronunciation lexicon names you want the
service to apply during synthesis. Lexicons are applied only if the
language of the lexicon is the same as the language of the voice. For
information about storing lexicons, see [PutLexicon](API_PutLexicon.md "API_PutLexicon.md").

Type: Array of strings

Array Members: Maximum number of 5 items.

Pattern: `[0-9A-Za-z]{1,20}`

Required: No

**[OutputFormat](#API_SynthesizeSpeech_RequestSyntax "#API_SynthesizeSpeech_RequestSyntax")**

The format in which the returned output will be encoded. For audio
stream, this will be mp3, ogg_vorbis, or pcm. For speech marks, this will
be json.

When pcm is used, the content returned is audio/pcm in a signed
16-bit, 1 channel (mono), little-endian format.

Type: String

Valid Values: `json | mp3 | ogg_vorbis | pcm`

Required: Yes

**[SampleRate](#API_SynthesizeSpeech_RequestSyntax "#API_SynthesizeSpeech_RequestSyntax")**

The audio frequency specified in Hz.

The valid values for mp3 and ogg_vorbis are "8000", "16000", "22050", "24000", "44100" and "48000". The default value for standard voices is "22050". The default
value for neural voices is "24000". The default value for long-form voices
is "24000". The default value for generative voices is "24000".

Valid values for pcm are "8000" and "16000" The default value is
"16000".

Type: String

Required: No

**[SpeechMarkTypes](#API_SynthesizeSpeech_RequestSyntax "#API_SynthesizeSpeech_RequestSyntax")**

The type of speech marks returned for the input text.

Type: Array of strings

Array Members: Maximum number of 4 items.

Valid Values: `sentence | ssml | viseme | word`

Required: No

**[Text](#API_SynthesizeSpeech_RequestSyntax "#API_SynthesizeSpeech_RequestSyntax")**

Input text to synthesize. If you specify `ssml` as the
`TextType`, follow the SSML format for the input text.

Type: String

Required: Yes

**[TextType](#API_SynthesizeSpeech_RequestSyntax "#API_SynthesizeSpeech_RequestSyntax")**

Specifies whether the input text is plain text or SSML. The
default value is plain text. For more information, see [Using
SSML](ssml.md "ssml.md").

Type: String

Valid Values: `ssml | text`

Required: No

**[VoiceId](#API_SynthesizeSpeech_RequestSyntax "#API_SynthesizeSpeech_RequestSyntax")**

Voice ID to use for the synthesis. You can get a list of available
voice IDs by calling the [DescribeVoices](API_DescribeVoices.md "API_DescribeVoices.md") operation.

Type: String

Valid Values: `Aditi | Amy | Astrid | Bianca | Brian | Camila | Carla | Carmen | Celine | Chantal | Conchita | Cristiano | Dora | Emma | Enrique | Ewa | Filiz | Gabrielle | Geraint | Giorgio | Gwyneth | Hans | Ines | Ivy | Jacek | Jan | Joanna | Joey | Justin | Karl | Kendra | Kevin | Kimberly | Lea | Liv | Lotte | Lucia | Lupe | Mads | Maja | Marlene | Mathieu | Matthew | Maxim | Mia | Miguel | Mizuki | Naja | Nicole | Olivia | Penelope | Raveena | Ricardo | Ruben | Russell | Salli | Seoyeon | Takumi | Tatyana | Vicki | Vitoria | Zeina | Zhiyu | Aria | Ayanda | Arlet | Hannah | Arthur | Daniel | Liam | Pedro | Kajal | Hiujin | Laura | Elin | Ida | Suvi | Ola | Hala | Andres | Sergio | Remi | Adriano | Thiago | Ruth | Stephen | Kazuha | Tomoko | Niamh | Sofie | Lisa | Isabelle | Zayd | Danielle | Gregory | Burcu | Jitka | Sabrina`

## Response Syntax

```
HTTP/1.1 200
Content-Type: `ContentType`
x-amzn-RequestCharacters: `RequestCharacters`

`AudioStream`
```

## Response Elements

If the action is successful, the service sends back an HTTP 200 response.

The response returns the following HTTP headers.

**[ContentType](#API_SynthesizeSpeech_ResponseSyntax "#API_SynthesizeSpeech_ResponseSyntax")**

Specifies the type audio stream. This should reflect the
`OutputFormat` parameter in your request.

- If you request `mp3` as the
  `OutputFormat`, the `ContentType` returned is
  audio/mpeg.
- If you request `ogg_vorbis` as the
  `OutputFormat`, the `ContentType` returned is
  audio/ogg.
- If you request `pcm` as the
  `OutputFormat`, the `ContentType` returned is
  audio/pcm in a signed 16-bit, 1 channel (mono), little-endian format.
- If you request `json` as the
  `OutputFormat`, the `ContentType` returned is
  application/x-json-stream.

**[RequestCharacters](#API_SynthesizeSpeech_ResponseSyntax "#API_SynthesizeSpeech_ResponseSyntax")**

Number of characters synthesized.

The response returns the following as the HTTP body.

**[AudioStream](#API_SynthesizeSpeech_ResponseSyntax "#API_SynthesizeSpeech_ResponseSyntax")**

Stream containing the synthesized speech.

## Errors

**EngineNotSupportedException**

This engine is not compatible with the voice that you have designated.
Choose a new voice that is compatible with the engine or change the engine
and restart the operation.

HTTP Status Code: 400

**InvalidSampleRateException**

The specified sample rate is not valid.

HTTP Status Code: 400

**InvalidSsmlException**

The SSML you provided is invalid. Verify the SSML syntax, spelling
of tags and values, and then try again.

HTTP Status Code: 400

**LanguageNotSupportedException**

The language specified is not currently supported by Amazon Polly in this
capacity.

HTTP Status Code: 400

**LexiconNotFoundException**

Amazon Polly can't find the specified lexicon. This could be caused by a
lexicon that is missing, its name is misspelled or specifying a lexicon
that is in a different region.

Verify that the lexicon exists, is in the region (see [ListLexicons](API_ListLexicons.md "API_ListLexicons.md")) and that you spelled its name is spelled
correctly. Then try again.

HTTP Status Code: 404

**MarksNotSupportedForFormatException**

Speech marks are not supported for the `OutputFormat`
selected. Speech marks are only available for content in `json`
format.

HTTP Status Code: 400

**ServiceFailureException**

An unknown condition has caused a service failure.

HTTP Status Code: 500

**SsmlMarksNotSupportedForTextTypeException**

SSML speech marks are not supported for plain text-type
input.

HTTP Status Code: 400

**TextLengthExceededException**

The value of the "Text" parameter is longer than the accepted
limits. For the `SynthesizeSpeech` API, the limit for input
text is a maximum of 6000 characters total, of which no more than 3000 can
be billed characters. For the `StartSpeechSynthesisTask` API,
the maximum is 200,000 characters, of which no more than 100,000 can be
billed characters. SSML tags are not counted as billed
characters.

HTTP Status Code: 400
