# AWS Availability Zones

Each Region has at least three Availability Zones. This helps you to design highly
available applications on AWS.

The code for an Availability Zone is its Region code followed by a letter identifier.
For example, `us-east-2a`, `us-east-2b`, and `us-east-2c`
are the Availability Zones in the `us-east-2` Region.

In our oldest Regions, we independently map Availability Zones to codes for each
AWS account. For example, the `us-east-1a` Availability Zone for your
account might not be the same physical location as it is in another account. For more
information, see [Regions with independently mapped Availability Zones](az-ids.md#independently-mapped-azs "az-ids.md#independently-mapped-azs").

Each Availability Zone has an AZ ID, which is the same physical location in every
AWS account. An AZ ID consists of the first three letters of the Region code,
followed by the number at the end of the Region code, followed by `-az`,
followed by a number. For example, `euw1-az1`, `euw1-az2`,
and `euw1-az3` are the AZ IDs for the Availability Zones in the `eu-west-1`
Region. For more information, see [AZ IDs](az-ids.md "az-ids.md").

The geography for an Availability Zone is the specific physical location of its
infrastructure. This information can help you meet your regulatory, compliance, and
operational requirements.

## Constrained Availability Zones

As Availability Zones grow over time, our ability to expand them can become
constrained. If this happens, we might restrict you from creating zonal resources
in a constrained Availability Zone, unless you already have resources in that
Availability Zone. Eventually, we might also remove the constrained Availability
Zone from the list of Availability Zones for new accounts. Therefore, your account
might have a different number of available Availability Zones in a Region than
another account does.

## Example commands

The following AWS CLI commands demonstrate how to get information about the Availability
Zones for your account.

###### To list the Availability Zones of a Region

Use the following [describe-availability-zones](../../../cli/latest/reference/ec2/describe-availability-zones.md "../../../cli/latest/reference/ec2/describe-availability-zones.md") command. To include any Local Zones and Wavelength
that are opted in for your account, omit the `--filters` option.

```
aws ec2 describe-availability-zones --filters Name=zone-type,Values=availability-zone --region `us-east-2` --query AvailabilityZones[].ZoneName
```

The following is example output for the US East (Ohio) Region.

```
[
    "us-east-2a",
    "us-east-2b",
    "us-east-2c"
]
```

###### To describe an Availability Zone

Use the following [describe-availability-zones](../../../cli/latest/reference/ec2/describe-availability-zones.md "../../../cli/latest/reference/ec2/describe-availability-zones.md") command.

```
aws ec2 describe-availability-zones --zone-name `us-east-2a` --region `us-east-2`
```

The following is example output for `us-east-2a` in the US East (Ohio) Region.

```
{
    "AvailabilityZones": [
        {
            "OptInStatus": "opt-in-not-required",
            "Messages": [],
            "RegionName": "us-east-2",
            "ZoneName": "us-east-2a",
            "ZoneId": "use2-az1",
            "GroupName": "us-east-2-zg-1",
            "NetworkBorderGroup": "us-east-2",
            "ZoneType": "availability-zone",
            "State": "available"
        }
    ]
}
```
