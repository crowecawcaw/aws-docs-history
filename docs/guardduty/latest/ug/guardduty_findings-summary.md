# Finding details

In the Amazon GuardDuty console, you can view finding details in the finding summary section.
Finding details vary based on the finding type.

There are two primary details that determine what kind of information is available for any
finding. The first is the resource type, which can be `Instance`,
`AccessKey`, `S3Bucket`, `S3Object`, `Kubernetes
 cluster`, `ECS cluster`, `Container`,
`RDSDBInstance`, `RDSLimitlessDB`, or `Lambda`. The second detail that determines
finding information is **Resource Role**. Resource role can be
`Target`, meaning the resource was the target of suspicious activity. For
instance type findings, resource role can also be `Actor`, which means that your
resource was the actor carrying out suspicious activity. This topic describes some of the
commonly available details for findings. For [GuardDuty Runtime Monitoring finding types](findings-runtime-monitoring.md "findings-runtime-monitoring.md")
and [Malware Protection for S3 finding type](gdu-malware-protection-s3-finding-types.md "gdu-malware-protection-s3-finding-types.md"), the resource role is not
populated.

## Finding overview

A finding's **Overview** section contains the most basic identifying
features of the finding, including the following information:

- **Account ID** – The ID of the AWS
  account in which the activity took place that prompted GuardDuty to generate this
  finding.
- **Count** – The number of times GuardDuty has
  aggregated an activity matching this pattern to this finding ID.
- **Created at** – The time and date when
  this finding was first created. If this value differs from **Updated
  at**, it indicates that the activity has occurred multiple times
  and is an ongoing issue.

###### Note

Timestamps for findings in the GuardDuty console appear in your local time
zone, while JSON exports and CLI outputs display timestamps in UTC.

- **Finding ID** – A unique identifier for
  this finding type and set of parameters. New occurrences of activity matching
  this pattern will be aggregated to the same ID.
- **Finding type** – A formatted string
  representing the type of activity that triggered the finding. For more
  information, see [GuardDuty finding format](guardduty_finding-format.md "guardduty_finding-format.md").
- **Region** – The AWS Region in which the
  finding was generated. For more information about supported Regions, see [Regions and endpoints](guardduty_regions.md "guardduty_regions.md")
- **Resource ID** – The ID of the AWS
  resource against which the activity took place that prompted GuardDuty to generate
  this finding.
- **Scan ID** – Applicable to findings when
  GuardDuty Malware Protection for EC2 is enabled, this is an identifier of the malware scan that runs on
  the EBS volumes attached to the potentially compromised EC2 instance or
  container workload. For more information, see [Malware Protection for EC2 finding details](#malware-protection-scan-details "#malware-protection-scan-details").
- **Severity** – A finding's assigned
  severity level of either Critical, High, Medium, or Low. For more information, see [Findings severity
  levels](guardduty_findings-severity.md "guardduty_findings-severity.md").

## Attack sequence

finding details

GuardDuty provides details for each finding it generates in your account. These details help you understand
the reasons behind the finding. This section focuses on details associated with [Attack sequence finding
types](guardduty-attack-sequence-finding-types.md "guardduty-attack-sequence-finding-types.md"). This includes insights such as potentially impacted
resources, timeline of events, indicators, signals, and endpoints involved in the finding.

To view details associated with signals that are GuardDuty findings, see the associated sections on this page.

In the GuardDuty console, when you select an attack sequence finding, the details side panel is divided into the following tabs:

- **Overview** – Provides a compact view of the attack sequence details, including
  signals, MITRE tactics, and potentially impacted resources.
- **Signals** – Displays a timeline of events that are involved in an attack sequence.
- **Resources** – Provides information about the potentially impacted resources, or the resources
  that are potentially at risk.

The following list provides descriptions associated with the attack sequence finding details.

**Signals**

A signal could be an API activity or a finding that GuardDuty
uses to detect an attack sequence finding. GuardDuty considers the weak signals that don't present themselves as clear threat,
piece them together, and correlate with individually generated findings. For more context, the **Signals**
tab provides a timeline of the signals, as observed by GuardDuty.

Each signal, that is a GuardDuty finding, has it's own severity level and value assigned to it.
In the GuardDuty console, you can select each signal to view the associated details.

**Actors**

Provides details about the threat actors in an attack sequence. For more information,
see [Actor](../APIReference/API_Actor.md "../APIReference/API_Actor.md") in _Amazon GuardDuty API Reference_.

**Endpoints**

Provides details about the network endpoints that were used in this
attack sequence. For more information,
see [NetworkEndpoint](../APIReference/API_NetworkEndpoint.md "../APIReference/API_NetworkEndpoint.md") in _Amazon GuardDuty API Reference_.
For information about how GuardDuty determines location, see [Geolocation details](#guardduty-finding-details-geolocation "#guardduty-finding-details-geolocation").

**Indicators**

Includes observed data that matches the pattern of a
security issue. This data specifies as to why GuardDuty there is an indication of a potentially suspicious activity. For example,
when the indicator name is `HIGH_RISK_API`, this indicates an action commonly used by threat actors, or
a sensitive action that may cause potential impact to an AWS account, such as accessing credentials or modifying a
resource.

The following table includes a list of potential indicators and their descriptions:

| Indicator name            | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

**MITRE tactics**

This field specifies the MITRE ATT&CK tactics that
the threat actor attempts through an attack sequence. GuardDuty uses the [MITRE ATT&ACK](guardduty_finding-format.md#guardduty_threat_purposes "guardduty_finding-format.md#guardduty_threat_purposes") framework
that adds context to the entire attack sequence. The colors that the GuardDuty console uses to specify the threat purposes
that have been used by the threat actor, align with the colors that indicate the critical, high, medium, and low
[Findings severity
levels](guardduty_findings-severity.md "guardduty_findings-severity.md").

**Network indicators**

Indicators include a combination of network indicator values that explain
why a network is indicative of a suspicious behavior. This section is applicable only when the
**Indicator** includes `SUSPICIOUS_NETWORK` or `MALICIOUS_IP`. The
following example shows how network indicators might be associated with an indicator, where:

- `AnyCompany` is an Autonomous System (AS).
- `TUNNEL_VPN`, `IS_ANONYMOUS`, and `ALLOWS_FREE_ACCESS` are the network indicators.

```
...{
    "key": "SUSPICIOUS_NETWORK",
    "values": [{
        "`AnyCompany`": [
            "TUNNEL_VPN",
            "IS_ANONYMOUS",
            "ALLOWS_FREE_ACCESS"
        ]
    }]
}
...
```

The following table includes the network indicator values and their description. These tags are added based
on the threat intelligence GuardDuty collects from sources such as Spur

  - **Protocol** – The network
    connection protocol observed in the activity that prompted GuardDuty to
    generate the finding.
  - **Local IP** – The original source
    IP address of the traffic that triggered the finding. This info can be
    used to distinguish between the IP address of an intermediate layer
    through which traffic flows, and the original source IP address of the
    traffic that triggered the finding. For example the IP address of an EKS
    pod as opposed to the IP address of the instance on which the EKS pod is
    running.
  - **Blocked** – Indicates whether
    the targeted port is blocked.

- **PORT_PROBE** – Indicates that a remote
  host probed the identified EC2 instance on multiple open ports. This action type
  has the following additional information:
  - **Local IP** – The original source
    IP address of the traffic that triggered the finding. This info can be
    used to distinguish between the IP address of an intermediate layer
    through which traffic flows, and the original source IP address of the
    traffic that triggered the finding. For example the IP address of an EKS
    pod as opposed to the IP address of the instance on which the EKS pod is
    running.
  - **Blocked** – Indicates whether
    the targeted port is blocked.

- **DNS_REQUEST** – Indicates that the
  identified EC2 instance queried a domain name. This action type has the
  following additional information:

    the targeted port is blocked.

- **AWS_API_CALL** – Indicates that an AWS
  API was invoked. This action type has the following additional
  information:
  - **API** – The name of the API
    operation that was invoked and thus prompted GuardDuty to generate this
    finding.

  ###### Note

  These operations can also include non-API events captured by
  AWS CloudTrail. For more information, see [Non-API events captured by CloudTrail](../../../awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/cloudtrail-non-api-events.md "../../../awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/cloudtrail-non-api-events.md").
  - **User Agent** – The user agent
    that made the API request. This value tells you whether the call was
    made from the AWS Management Console, an AWS service, the AWS SDKs, or the
    AWS CLI.
  - **ERROR CODE** – If the finding
    was triggered by a failed API call this displays the error code for that
    call.
  - **Service name** – The DNS name of
    the service that attempted to make the API call that triggered the
    finding.

- **RDS_LOGIN_ATTEMPT** – Indicates that a
  login attempt was made to the potentially compromised database from a remote IP
  address.
  - **IP address** – The remote IP
    address that was used to make the potentially suspicious login
    attempt.

## Actor or Target

A finding has an **Actor** section if the **Resource
role** was `TARGET`. This indicates that your resource was
targeted by suspicious activity, and the **Actor** section contains
details about the entity that targeted your resource.

A finding has a **Target** section if the **Resource
role** was `ACTOR`. This indicates that your resource was
involved in suspicious activity against a remote host, and this section contains
information on the IP or domain that your resource targeted.

The information available in the **Actor** or
**Target** section can include the following:

- **Affiliated** – Details about whether the
  AWS account of the remote API caller is related to your GuardDuty environment. If
  this value is `true`, the API caller is affiliated to your account in
  some manner; if `false`, the API caller is from outside your
  environment.
- **Remote Account ID** – The account ID
  that owns the outbound IP address that was used to access the resource at the
  final network.
- **IP address** – The IP address involved
  in the activity that prompted GuardDuty to generate the finding.
- **Location** – Location information for
  the IP address involved in the activity that prompted GuardDuty to generate the
  finding.
- **Organization** – ISP organization
  information of the IP address involved in the activity that prompted GuardDuty to
  generate the finding.
- **Port** – The port number involved in the
  activity that prompted GuardDuty to generate the finding.
- **Domain** – The domain involved in the
  activity that prompted GuardDuty to generate the finding.
- **Domain with suffix** – The second- and
  top-level domain involved in an activity that potentially prompted GuardDuty to
  generate the finding. For a list of top-level and second-level domains, see
  [public suffix list](https://publicsuffix.org/ "https://publicsuffix.org/").

## Geolocation details

GuardDuty determines the location and network of requests by using MaxMind GeoIP databases. MaxMind reports
very high accuracy of their data at country level, although accuracy varies according to factors
such as country and type of IP address.

For more information about MaxMind, see
[MaxMind IP Geolocation](https://support.maxmind.com/hc/en-us/sections/4407519834267-IP-Geolocation "https://support.maxmind.com/hc/en-us/sections/4407519834267-IP-Geolocation"). If you believe any of the GeoIP data incorrect,
submit a correction request to MaxMind at
[MaxMind
Correct GeoIP2 Data](https://support.maxmind.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408252036123-GeoIP-Correction "https://support.maxmind.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408252036123-GeoIP-Correction").

## Additional information

All findings have an **Additional information** section that can
include the following information:

- **Threat list name** – The name of the
  threat list that includes the IP address or the domain name involved in the
  activity that prompted GuardDuty to generate the finding.
- **Sample** – A true or false value that
  indicates whether this is a sample finding.
- **Archived** – A true or false value that
  indicates whether this is finding has been archived.

    identifier of the GuardDuty security agent.

## Evidence

Findings based on threat intelligence have an **Evidence** section
that includes the following information:

- **Threat intelligence details** – The name
  of the threat list on which the recognized `Threat name` appears.
- **Threat name** – The name of the malware
  family or other identifier that is associated with the threat.
- **Threat file SHA256** – SHA256 of the
  file that generated the finding.

## Anomalous behavior

Findings types that end in **AnomalousBehavior** indicate that the
finding was generated by the GuardDuty anomaly detection machine learning (ML) model. The ML
model evaluates all API requests to your account and identifies anomalous events that
are associated with tactics used by adversaries. The ML model tracks various factors of
the API request, such as the user that made the request, the location the request was
made from, and the specific API that was requested.

Details about which factors of the API request are unusual for the CloudTrail user identity
that invoked the request can be found in the finding details. The identities are defined
by the [CloudTrail userIdentity Element](../../../awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/cloudtrail-event-reference-user-identity.md "../../../awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/cloudtrail-event-reference-user-identity.md"), and the possible values are: `Root`,
`IAMUser`, `AssumedRole`, `FederatedUser`,
`AWSAccount`, or `AWSService`.

In addition to the details available for all GuardDuty findings that are associated with
API activity, **AnomalousBehavior** findings have additional details
that are outlined in the following section. These details can be viewed in the console
and are also available in the finding's JSON.

- **Anomalous APIs** – A list of API
  requests that were invoked by the user identity in proximity to the primary API
  request associated with the finding. This pane further breaks down the details
  of the API event in the following ways.
  - The first API listed is the primary API, which is the API request
    associated with the highest-risk observed activity. This is the API that
    triggered the finding and correlates to the attack stage of the finding
    type. This is also the API that is detailed under the
    **Action** section in the console, and in the
    finding's JSON.
  - Any other APIs listed are additional anomalous APIs from the listed
    user identity observed in proximity to the primary API. If there is only
    one API on the list, the ML model did not identify any additional API
    requests from that user identity as anomalous.
  - The list of APIs is divided based on whether an API was
    **successfully called**, or if the API was
    unsuccessfully called, meaning an error response was received. The type
    of error response received is listed above each unsuccessfully called
    API. Possible error response types are: `access denied`,
    `access denied exception`, `auth failure`,
    `instance limit exceeded`, `invalid permission -
duplicate`, `invalid permission - not found`, and
    `operation not permitted`.
  - APIs are categorized by their associated service.
  - For more context, choose **Historical APIs** to view
    the details about the top APIs, to a maximum of 20, usually seen for
    both the user identity and all users within the account. The APIs are
    marked **Rare (less than once a month)**,
    **Infrequent (a few times a month)**, or
    **Frequent (daily to weekly)**, depending on how
    often they are used within your account.

- **Unusual Behavior (Account)** – This
  section gives additional details about the profiled behavior for your
  account.

### S3 volume-based anomalies

This section details the contextual information for S3 volume-based anomalies. The
volume-based finding ([Exfiltration:S3/AnomalousBehavior](guardduty_finding-types-s3.md#exfiltration-s3-anomalousbehavior "guardduty_finding-types-s3.md#exfiltration-s3-anomalousbehavior")) monitors for unusual
numbers of S3 API calls made to the S3 buckets by users, indicating potential data
exfiltration. The following S3 API calls are monitored for volume-based anomaly
detection.

- `GetObject`
- `CopyObject.Read`
- `SelectObjectContent`

The following metrics would help to build a baseline of usual behavior when an
IAM entity accesses an S3 bucket. To detect data exfiltration, volume-based
anomaly detection finding evaluates all the activities against the usual behavioral
baseline. Choose **Historical behavior** in the **Unusual
behavior (User Identity)**, **Observed Volume (User
Identity)**, and **Observed Volume (Bucket)** sections
to view the following metrics, respectively.

- Number of `s3-api-name` API calls invoked by the IAM user or
  IAM role (depends on which one was issued) associated with the affected S3
  bucket over the past 24 hours.
- Number of `s3-api-name` API calls invoked by the IAM user or
  IAM role (depends on which one was issued) associated with all S3 buckets
  over the past 24 hours.
- Number of `s3-api-name` API calls across all IAM user or
  IAM role (depends on which one was issued) associated with the affected S3
  bucket over the past 24 hours.

### RDS login activity-based anomalies

This section details the count of login attempts performed by the unusual actor
and is grouped by the result of the login attempts. The [RDS Protection finding types](findings-rds-protection.md "findings-rds-protection.md") identify anomalous behavior by monitoring the login events for unusual patterns
of `successfulLoginCount`, `failedLoginCount`, and
`incompleteConnectionCount`.

- **successfulLoginCount** – This
  counter represents the sum of successful connections (correct combination of
  login attributes) made to the database instance by the unusual actor. Login
  attributes include user name, password, and database name.
- **failedLoginCount** – This counter
  represents the sum of failed (unsuccessful) login attempts made to establish
  a connection to the database instance. This indicates that one or more
  attributes of the login combination, such as user name, password, or
  database name were incorrect.
- **incompleteConnectionCount** – This
  counter represents the number of connection attempts that can't be
  classified as successful or failed. These connections are closed before the
  database provides a response. For example, port scanning where the database
  port is connected but no piece of information is sent to the database, or
  the connection was
  aborted
  before the login completed in a successful or failed attempt.
