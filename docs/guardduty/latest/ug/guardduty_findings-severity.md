# Severity levels of GuardDuty findings

Each GuardDuty finding has an assigned severity level and value that reflects the
potential risk the finding could have to your environment, as determined by our security
engineers. The value of the severity can fall anywhere within the 1.0 to 10.0 range, with
higher values indicating greater security risk. To help you determine a response to a
potential security issue that is highlighted by a finding, GuardDuty breaks down this range
into _Critical_, _High_, _Medium_,
and _Low_ severity levels.

A finding of a particular type may have a
different severity depending on the context specific to the finding.
To view a consolidated list of default severity levels for all GuardDuty finding types, see
[GuardDuty active finding types](guardduty_finding-types-active.md#findings-table "guardduty_finding-types-active.md#findings-table").

The following sections explain defined severity levels for the GuardDuty
findings.

## Critical severity

**Value range**: 9.0 - 10.0

**Description**: A critical severity level indicates that an attack sequence
may be in progress or had recently happened. One or more AWS resources, such as
IAM user sign-in credentials and Amazon S3 bucket, are potentially being compromised or may have
already been compromised.

**Recommendation**: GuardDuty recommends that you prioritize triaging and remediating
all critical severity findings because these issues
can be a part of a ransomware attack and can escalate at any time. View details about the involved
resources and start addressing the security issues. For more information, see
[Remediating findings](guardduty_remediate.md "guardduty_remediate.md").

## High severity

**Value range**: 7.0 - 8.9

**Description**: A High severity level indicates that the resource in question
(an Amazon EC2 instance or a set of IAM user sign-in credentials) is compromised and is
actively being used for unauthorized purposes.

**Recommendation**: GuardDuty recommends that you treat any
high severity finding security issue as a priority and take
immediate remediation steps to prevent further unauthorized use of your resources.
For example, clean up your Amazon EC2 instance or terminate it, or rotate the IAM credentials. Follow
the steps in [Remediating findings](guardduty_remediate.md "guardduty_remediate.md") to
remediate the finding.

## Medium severity

**Value range**: 4.0 - 6.9

**Description**: A medium severity level indicates suspicious
activity that deviates from normally observed behavior and, depending on your use case,
may be indicative of a resource compromise.

**Recommendation**: GuardDuty recommends investigating the potentially impacted
resource at your earliest convenience. Remediation steps will vary by resource and
finding family. An establish approach is for you to confirm
that the activity is authorized and consistent with your use case.
If you cannot identify the cause, or confirm the activity was
authorized, you should consider the resource compromised. Follow
the steps in [Remediating findings](guardduty_remediate.md "guardduty_remediate.md") to
remediate the finding.

Here are some things to consider when reviewing a medium level
finding:

- Check if an authorized user has installed new software
  that changed the behavior of a resource (for example,
  allowed higher than normal traffic, or enabled communication
  on a new port).
- Check if an authorized user changed the control plane
  settings, for example, modified a security group
  setting.
- Run an anti-virus scan on the implicated resource to
  detect unauthorized software.
- Verify the permissions that are attached to the implicated
  IAM role, user, group, or set of credentials. These might
  have to be changed or rotated.

## Low severity

**Value range**: 1.0 - 3.9

**Description**: A low severity level indicates
attempted suspicious activity that did not compromise your
environment, for example, a port scan or a failed intrusion
attempt.

**Recommendation**: There is no immediate recommended action, but it is worth taking a
note of this information as it may indicate someone is looking for
weak points in your environment.
