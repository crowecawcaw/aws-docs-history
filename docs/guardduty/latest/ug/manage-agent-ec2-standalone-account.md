# Enabling GuardDuty automated agent for

Amazon EC2 resources in a standalone account

A standalone account owns the decision to enable or disable a protection plan in their
AWS account in a specific AWS Region.

If your account is associated with a GuardDuty administrator account through AWS Organizations, or by the method
of invitation, this section doesn't apply to your account. For more information,
see [Enabling Runtime Monitoring for
multiple-account environments](enable-runtime-monitoring-multiple-acc-env.md "enable-runtime-monitoring-multiple-acc-env.md").

After you enable Runtime Monitoring, ensure to install GuardDuty security agent through automated
configuration or manual deployment. As a part of completing all the steps listed in the
following procedure, make sure to install the security agent.

Based on your preference to monitor all or selective Amazon EC2 resources, choose a
preferred method and follow the steps in the following table.

Configure for all instances

###### To configure Runtime Monitoring for all instances in your standalone

account

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the GuardDuty console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/guardduty/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/guardduty/ "https://console.aws.amazon.com/guardduty/").
2. In the navigation pane, choose
   **Runtime Monitoring**.
3. Under the **Configuration** tab, choose
   **Edit**.
4. In the **EC2** section, choose
   **Enable**.
5. Choose **Save**.
6. You can verify that the SSM association that GuardDuty creates will
   install and manage the security agent on all the EC2 resources
   belonging to your account.
   1. Open the AWS Systems Manager console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/ "https://console.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/").
   2. Open the **Targets** tab for the SSM
      association
      (`GuardDutyRuntimeMonitoring-do-not-delete`).
      Observe that the **Tag key** appears as
      **InstanceIds**.

Using inclusion tag in selected instances

###### To configure GuardDuty security agent for selected Amazon EC2

instances

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon EC2 console at
   [https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/ "https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/").
2. Add the `GuardDutyManaged`:`true` tag to the
   instances that you want GuardDuty to monitor and detect potential
   threats. For information about adding this tag, see [To add a tag to an individual resource](../../../AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/Using_Tags.md#adding-or-deleting-tags "../../../AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/Using_Tags.md#adding-or-deleting-tags").
3. You can verify that the SSM association that GuardDuty creates will
   install and manage the security agent only on the EC2 resources that
   are tagged with the inclusion tags.

Open the AWS Systems Manager console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/ "https://console.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/").

    1. Open the **Targets** tab for the SSM
     association that gets created
     (`GuardDutyRuntimeMonitoring-do-not-delete`).
     The **Tag key** appears as
     **tag:GuardDutyManaged**.

Using exclusion tag in selected instances

###### Note

Ensure that you add the exclusion tag to your Amazon EC2 instances before you launch them. Once you have enabled automated agent
configuration for Amazon EC2, any EC2 instance that launches
without an exclusion tag will be covered under GuardDuty automated agent configuration.

###### To configure GuardDuty security agent for selected Amazon EC2

instances

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon EC2 console at
   [https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/ "https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/").
2. Add the `GuardDutyManaged`:`false` tag to
   the instances that you **don't**
   want GuardDuty to monitor and detect potential threats. For information
   about adding this tag, see [To add a tag to an individual resource](../../../AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/Using_Tags.md#adding-or-deleting-tags "../../../AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/Using_Tags.md#adding-or-deleting-tags").
3. ###### For the [exclusion tags to be available](prereq-runtime-monitoring-ec2-support.md#general-runtime-monitoring-prereq-ec2 "prereq-runtime-monitoring-ec2-support.md#general-runtime-monitoring-prereq-ec2") in the instance

   metadata, perform the following steps:
   1. Under the **Details** tab of your
      instance, view the status for **Allow tags in
      instance metadata**.

   If it is currently **Disabled**, use the
   following steps to change the status to
   **Enabled**. Otherwise, skip this
   step. 2. Select the instance for which you want to allow
   tags. 3. Under the **Actions** menu, choose
   **Instance settings**. 4. Choose **Allow tags in instance
   metadata**. 5. Under **Access to tags in instance
   metadata**, select
   **Allow**. 6. Choose **Save**.

4. After you have added the exclusion tag perform the same steps as
   sepcified in the **Configure for all
   instances** tab.

You can now assess runtime [Runtime coverage and troubleshooting for Amazon EC2
instance](gdu-assess-coverage-ec2.md "gdu-assess-coverage-ec2.md").
