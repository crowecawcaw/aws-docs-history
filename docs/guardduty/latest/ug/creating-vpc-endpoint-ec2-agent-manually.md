# Prerequisite –

Creating Amazon VPC endpoint manually

Before you can install the GuardDuty security agent, you must create an Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC)
endpoint. This will help GuardDuty receive the runtime events of your Amazon EC2
instances.

###### Note

There is no additional cost for the usage of the VPC endpoint.

###### To create a Amazon VPC endpoint

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon VPC console at
   [https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/ "https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/").
2. In the navigation pane, under **VPC private cloud**, choose
   **Endpoints**.
3. Choose **Create Endpoint**.
4. On the **Create endpoint** page, for **Service
   category**, choose **Other endpoint
   services**.
5. For **Service name**, enter
   `com.amazonaws.`us-east-1`.guardduty-data`.

Make sure to replace `us-east-1` with your
AWS Region. This must be the same Region as the Amazon EC2 instance that belongs to
your AWS account ID. 6. Choose **Verify service**. 7. After the service name is successfully verified, choose the
**VPC** where your instance resides. Add the following
policy to restrict Amazon VPC endpoint usage to the specified account only. With the
organization `Condition` provided below this policy, you can update
the following policy to restrict access to your endpoint. To provide the Amazon VPC
endpoint support to specific account IDs in your organization, see [Organization condition to restrict access to your endpoint](#gdu-runtime-ec2-organization-restrict-access-vpc-endpoint "#gdu-runtime-ec2-organization-restrict-access-vpc-endpoint").

JSON

```
`{
 "Version":"2012-10-17",
 "Statement": [
 {
 "Action": "*",
 "Resource": "*",
 "Effect": "Allow",
 "Principal": "*"
 },
 {
 "Condition": {
 "StringNotEquals": {
 "aws:PrincipalAccount": "`111122223333`"
 }
 },
 "Action": "*",
 "Resource": "*",
 "Effect": "Deny",
 "Principal": "*"
 }
 ]
}`

```

The `aws:PrincipalAccount` account ID must match the account
containing the VPC and VPC endpoint. The following list shows how to share the
VPC endpoint with other AWS account IDs:

    * To specify multiple accounts to access the VPC endpoint, replace
     `"aws:PrincipalAccount:
     "`111122223333`"` with
     the following block:



    ```
    "aws:PrincipalAccount": [
              "666666666666",
              "555555555555"
          ]
    ```

    Make sure to replace the AWS account IDs with the account IDs of
     those accounts that need to access the VPC endpoint.
    * To allow all the members from an organization to access the VPC
     endpoint, replace `"aws:PrincipalAccount:
     "`111122223333`"` with
     the following line:



    ```
    "aws:PrincipalOrgID": "`o-abcdef0123`"
    ```

    Make sure to replace the organization
     `o-abcdef0123` with your organization
     ID.
    * To restrict accessing a resource by an organization ID, add your
     `ResourceOrgID` to the policy. For more information, see
     [`aws:ResourceOrgID`](../../../IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_condition-keys.md#condition-keys-resourceorgid "../../../IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_condition-keys.md#condition-keys-resourceorgid") in the
     *IAM User Guide*.



    ```
    "aws:ResourceOrgID": "o-abcdef0123"
    ```

8. Under **Additional settings**, choose **Enable DNS
   name**.
9. Under **Subnets**, choose the subnets in which your instance
   resides.
10. Under **Security groups**, choose a security group that has
    the in-bound port 443 enabled from your VPC (or your Amazon EC2 instance). If you
    don't already have a security group that has an in-bound port 443 enabled, see
    [Create a security
    group for your VPC](../../../vpc/latest/userguide/creating-security-groups.md "../../../vpc/latest/userguide/creating-security-groups.md") in the
    _Amazon VPC User Guide_.

If there is an issue while restricting the in-bound permissions to your VPC
(or instance), you can the in-bound 443 port from any IP address
`(0.0.0.0/0)`. However, GuardDuty recommends using IP addresses that
matches the CIDR block for your VPC. For more information, see [VPC
CIDR blocks](../../../vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-cidr-blocks.md "../../../vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-cidr-blocks.md") in the _Amazon VPC User Guide_.
After you have followed the steps, see [Validating VPC
endpoint configuration](validate-vpc-endpoint-config-runtime-monitoring.md "validate-vpc-endpoint-config-runtime-monitoring.md") to ensure that the VPC
endpoint was set up correctly.
