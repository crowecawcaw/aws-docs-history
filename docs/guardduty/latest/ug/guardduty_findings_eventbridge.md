# Processing GuardDuty findings with

Amazon EventBridge

GuardDuty automatically publishes (sends) findings as events to Amazon EventBridge (formerly Amazon CloudWatch Events),
a serverless event bus service. EventBridge delivers a stream of near real-time
data from applications and services to targets such as Amazon Simple Notification Service
(Amazon SNS) topics, AWS Lambda functions, and Amazon Kinesis streams. For more information, see [Amazon EventBridge User Guide](../../../eventbridge/latest/userguide/eb-what-is.md "../../../eventbridge/latest/userguide/eb-what-is.md").

EventBridge enables automated monitoring and processing of GuardDuty findings by receiving
[events](../../../eventbridge/latest/userguide/aws-events.md "../../../eventbridge/latest/userguide/aws-events.md"). EventBridge receives events for both newly generated findings and
aggregated findings, where subsequent
occurrences of an existing finding are combined with the original. Every GuardDuty
finding is assigned a finding ID, and GuardDuty creates an EventBridge event for every finding with a unique
finding ID.
For information on how aggregation works in GuardDuty, see
[GuardDuty finding aggregation](finding-aggregation.md "finding-aggregation.md").

In addition to automated monitoring and processing, use of EventBridge enables longer-term
retention of your findings data. GuardDuty stores findings for 90 days. With EventBridge, you can
send findings data to your preferred storage platform and store the data for as long as you like.
To retain findings for a longer duration, GuardDuty supports [Exporting generated findings to
Amazon S3](guardduty_exportfindings.md "guardduty_exportfindings.md").

## Understanding EventBridge notification

frequency in GuardDuty

This section explains how often you receive finding notifications through EventBridge
and how to update the frequency for subsequent finding occurrences.

**Notifications for newly generated findings with a
unique finding ID**

GuardDuty sends these notifications in near real-time
when it generates a finding with a unique finding ID.
The notification includes all subsequent
occurrences of this subsequent occurrences of this
finding ID during the notification generation process.

The notification frequency for newly generated findings
is in near real-time. By default, you can not modify this frequency.

**Notifications for subsequent finding
occurrences**

GuardDuty aggregates
all subsequent occurrences of a particular finding type that take place
within the 6-hour intervals into one single event.
Only an administrator account can update the EventBridge notification frequency for
subsequent finding occurrences. A member account can't update this frequency
for their own account. For example, if the delegated GuardDuty administrator account updates the frequency to one
hour, all member accounts will also have one hour notification frequency about the
subsequent finding occurrences sent to EventBridge. For more
information, see [Multiple accounts in Amazon GuardDuty](guardduty_accounts.md "guardduty_accounts.md").

As an administrator account, you can customize the default frequency of
notifications about the subsequent finding occurrences. Possible values
are 15 minutes, 1 hour, or the default 6 hours. For information about
setting the frequency for these notifications, see [Step 5 – Setting frequency
to export updated active findings](guardduty_exportfindings.md#guardduty_exportfindings-frequency "guardduty_exportfindings.md#guardduty_exportfindings-frequency").

For more details about administrator account receiving EventBridge notifications for member accounts,
see [EventBridge rule for
multi-account environments](#guardduty_findings_eventbridge_multiaccount "#guardduty_findings_eventbridge_multiaccount").

## Set up an Amazon SNS

topic and endpoint (Email, Slack, and Amazon Chime)

Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) is a fully managed service that provides message
delivery from publishers to subscribers. Publishers communicate
asynchronously with subscribers by sending messages to a _topic_.
A topic is a logical access point and communication channel that
lets you group multiple endpoints such as AWS Lambda, Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS), HTTP/S, and
an email address.

###### Note

You can
add an Amazon SNS topic to your preferred EventBridge event rule during or after the creation of the rule.

**Create an Amazon SNS topic**

To
begin, you must first set up a topic in Amazon SNS and add an endpoint. To create a topic, perform the steps in [Step 1: Creating a topic](../../../sns/latest/dg/sns-create-topic.md "../../../sns/latest/dg/sns-create-topic.md")
in the _Amazon Simple Notification Service Developer Guide_. After the topic gets created,
copy the topic ARN to the clipboard. You will use this topic ARN to
continue with one of the preferred setups.

Choose a preferred method to establish where you want to send GuardDuty finding data.

Email setup
**To set up an email endpoint**

After you [Create an Amazon SNS topic](#guardduty-set-up-sns-topic-eventbridge "#guardduty-set-up-sns-topic-eventbridge"),
the next step is to create a subscription to this topic. Perform the steps under
[Step 2: Creating a subscription to an Amazon SNS topic](../../../sns/latest/dg/sns-create-subscribe-endpoint-to-topic.md "../../../sns/latest/dg/sns-create-subscribe-endpoint-to-topic.md")
in the _Amazon Simple Notification Service Developer Guide_.

1. For **Topic ARN**, use
   the topic ARN created in the [Create an Amazon SNS topic](#guardduty-set-up-sns-topic-eventbridge "#guardduty-set-up-sns-topic-eventbridge") step. The topic ARN
   looks similar to the following:

```
arn:aws:sns:`us-east-2`:`123456789012`:`your_topic`
```

2. For **Protocol**, select
   **Email**.
3. For **Endpoint**, enter an email
   address where you want to receive the notifications from Amazon SNS.

After the subscription gets created, you will need to confirm it through your email client.

Slack setup
**To configure an Amazon Q Developer in chat applications client - Slack**

After you [Create an Amazon SNS topic](#guardduty-set-up-sns-topic-eventbridge "#guardduty-set-up-sns-topic-eventbridge"),
the next step is to configure the client for Slack.

Perform the steps under
[Tutorial: Get started
with Slack](../../../chatbot/latest/adminguide/slack-setup.md "../../../chatbot/latest/adminguide/slack-setup.md") in the _Amazon Q Developer in chat applications Administrator Guide_.

Chime setup
**To configure an Amazon Q Developer in chat applications client - Chime**

After you [Create an Amazon SNS topic](#guardduty-set-up-sns-topic-eventbridge "#guardduty-set-up-sns-topic-eventbridge"),
the next step is to configure Amazon Q Developer for Chime.

Perform the steps under
[Tutorial: Get started
with Amazon Chime](../../../chatbot/latest/adminguide/chime-setup.md "../../../chatbot/latest/adminguide/chime-setup.md") in the _Amazon Q Developer in chat applications Administrator Guide_.

## Using Amazon EventBridge for GuardDuty

findings

With EventBridge, you create rules to specify the events that you want to monitor. These rules
also specify the target services and applications that can
perform automated actions if these events occur. A [target](../../../eventbridge/latest/userguide/eb-targets.md "../../../eventbridge/latest/userguide/eb-targets.md")
is a destination (a resource or an
endpoint) that EventBridge sends an event to when the event matches the event pattern defined
in the rule. Each event is a JSON object that conforms to the EventBridge schema for
AWS events and contains a JSON representation of a finding.
You can tailor the rule to send only those
events that meet a certain criteria. For more information, see [JSON Schema topic].
Because the findings data
is structured as an [EventBridge
event](../../../eventbridge/latest/userguide/eventbridge-and-event-patterns.md "../../../eventbridge/latest/userguide/eventbridge-and-event-patterns.md"), you can monitor, process, and act upon findings by using other
applications, services, and tools.

In order to receive notifications about GuardDuty findings based on events, you must
create an EventBridge rule and a target for GuardDuty. This rule enables EventBridge to send notifications
for findings that GuardDuty generates to the target that is specified in the rule.

###### Note

EventBridge and CloudWatch Events are the same underlying service and API. However, EventBridge includes
additional features that help you receive events from software as a service (SaaS)
applications and your own applications. Because the underlying service and API are
the same, the event schema for GuardDuty findings is also the same.

**How archived and non-archived findings in GuardDuty work with EventBridge**

For findings that you manually archive, the initial and all subsequent occurrences
of these findings (generated after the archiving is complete) are sent to EventBridge based on a specific
notification frequency. For more information, see [Understanding EventBridge notification
frequency in GuardDuty](#eventbridge-freq-notifications-gdu "#eventbridge-freq-notifications-gdu").

For the findings that are automatically archived with
[Suppression rules](findings_suppression-rule.md "findings_suppression-rule.md"),
the initial and all subsequent occurrences of these findings (generated after the archiving
is complete) are _not_ sent to EventBridge. You
can view these automatically archived findings in the GuardDuty console.

### Event schema

An [event
pattern](../../../eventbridge/latest/userguide/eb-event-patterns.md "../../../eventbridge/latest/userguide/eb-event-patterns.md") defines the data EventBridge uses to
determine whether to send the event to the target. The EventBridge
event for GuardDuty has the following format:

```
{
         "version": "0",
         "id": "`cd2d702e-ab31-411b-9344-793ce56b1bc7`",
         "detail-type": "GuardDuty Finding",
         "source": "aws.guardduty",
         "account": "`111122223333`",
         "time": "1970-01-01T00:00:00Z",
         "region": "`us-east-1`",
         "resources": [],
         "detail": {`GUARDDUTY_FINDING_JSON_OBJECT`}
        }
```

The `detail` value returns the JSON details of a single
finding as an object, as
opposed to returning the entire _findings_
response syntax which supports multiple
findings within an array.

For a complete list of all the parameters included in
`GUARDDUTY_FINDING_JSON_OBJECT`, see [GetFindings](../APIReference/API_GetFindings.md#API_GetFindings_ResponseSyntax "../APIReference/API_GetFindings.md#API_GetFindings_ResponseSyntax"). The `id` parameter that appears in
`GUARDDUTY_FINDING_JSON_OBJECT` is the finding ID previously described.

## Creating an EventBridge rule for

GuardDuty findings

The following procedures explain how to use the Amazon EventBridge console and the [AWS Command Line Interface
(AWS CLI)](../../../cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-welcome.md "../../../cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-welcome.md") to create an EventBridge rule for GuardDuty findings. The rule detects EventBridge
events that use the event schema and pattern for GuardDuty findings, and it sends those
events to an AWS Lambda function for processing.

AWS Lambda is a compute service that you can use to run code without provisioning or
managing servers. You package your code and upload it to AWS Lambda as a _Lambda function_. AWS Lambda then runs the function when the
function is invoked. A function can be invoked manually by you, automatically in
response to events, or in response to requests from applications or services. For
information about creating and invoking Lambda functions, see the [AWS Lambda Developer Guide](../../../lambda/latest/dg/welcome.md "../../../lambda/latest/dg/welcome.md").

Choose your preferred method to create an EventBridge rule that sends your GuardDuty
finding to a target.

Console
Follow these steps to use the Amazon EventBridge console to create a rule that
automatically sends all GuardDuty finding events to a Lambda function
for processing. The rule uses
default settings for rules that run when specific events are received. For details
about rule settings or to learn how to create a rule that uses custom settings, see
[Creating rules that react to events](../../../eventbridge/latest/userguide/eb-create-rule.md "../../../eventbridge/latest/userguide/eb-create-rule.md")
in the _Amazon EventBridge User Guide_.

Before you create this rule, create the Lambda function that you want the
rule to use as a target. When you create the rule, you'll need to specify
this function as the target for the rule. Your target can also be the
SNS topic that you created earlier. For more information, see
[Set up an Amazon SNS
topic and endpoint (Email, Slack, and Amazon Chime)](#guardduty-eventbridge-set-up-sns-and-endpoint "#guardduty-eventbridge-set-up-sns-and-endpoint").

API
The following procedure shows how to use AWS CLI commands to create a EventBridge rule and
target for GuardDuty. Specifically, the procedure shows you how to create a rule that
enables EventBridge to send events for all findings that GuardDuty generates to an AWS Lambda
function as a target for the rule.

###### Note

In this example, we're using a Lambda function as the target
for the rule that triggers EventBridge. You can also
configure other AWS resources as
targets to trigger EventBridge.
GuardDuty and EventBridge support the following target types -
Amazon EC2 instances, Amazon Kinesis streams, Amazon ECS tasks, AWS Step Functions state machines, the
`run` command, and built-in targets. For more information,
see [PutTargets](../../../eventbridge/latest/APIReference/API_PutTargets.md "../../../eventbridge/latest/APIReference/API_PutTargets.md")
in the _Amazon EventBridge API Reference_.

###### To create a rule and target

1. To create a rule that enables EventBridge to send events for all findings that GuardDuty
   generates, run the following EventBridge CLI command.

```
aws events put-rule --name `your-rule-name` --event-pattern "{\"source\":[\"aws.guardduty\"]}"
```

You can further customize your rule so that it instructs EventBridge to send
events only for a subset of the GuardDuty-generated findings. This subset is
based on the finding attribute or attributes that are specified in the rule.
For example, use the following CLI command to create a rule that enables
EventBridge to only send events for the GuardDuty findings with the severity of either
5 or 8:

```
aws events put-rule --name `your-rule-name` --event-pattern "{\"source\":[\"aws.guardduty\"],\"detail-type\":[\"GuardDuty Finding\"],\"detail\":{\"severity\":[5,8]}}"
```

For this purpose, you can use any of the property values that are
available in the JSON for GuardDuty findings. 2. To attach a Lambda function as a target for the rule that you created in step
1, run the following CloudWatch CLI command.

```
aws events put-targets --rule `your-target-name` --targets Id=1,Arn=arn:aws:lambda:`us-east-1`:`111122223333`:function:`your_function`
```

Make sure to replace `your-target-name` in the command above with
your actual Lambda function for the GuardDuty events. 3. To add the permissions required to invoke the target, run the following Lambda
CLI command.

```
aws lambda add-permission --function-name `your-target-name` --statement-id 1 --action 'lambda:InvokeFunction' --principal events.amazonaws.com
```

Make sure to replace `your_function` in the command above with
your actual Lambda function for the GuardDuty events.

## EventBridge rule for GuardDuty multi-account

environments

When using a delegated GuardDuty administrator account, you can view the events
generated in the member accounts and take action using other applications
and services. EventBridge rules in your administrator account will trigger based on
applicable findings from your member accounts. If you set up finding
notifications through EventBridge in your administrator account, you will receive notifications
of findings from both your account and member accounts. For example, you can use
EventBridge to send specific types of findings to a Lambda function that processes
and sends the data to your security incident and event management (SIEM) system.

You can identify the member account where the GuardDuty finding originated using
the `accountId` field of the finding's JSON details. To create
a custom event rule for specific member accounts, create a new rule and
use the following template in **Event pattern**. Replace
`123456789012` with the `accountId`of the member account for which you want to
trigger the event.

```
{
  "source": [
    "aws.guardduty"
  ],
  "detail-type": [
    "GuardDuty Finding"
  ],
  "detail": {
    "accountId": [
      "`123456789012`"
    ]
  }
}

```

###### Note

This example creates a rule that matches all findings from the specified
account ID. You can include multiple account IDs by separating them with
commas, following JSON syntax.
