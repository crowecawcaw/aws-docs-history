# Validating VPC endpoint configuration
<a name="validate-vpc-endpoint-config-runtime-monitoring"></a>

After you install the security agent manually or through GuardDuty automated configuration, you can use this document to validate that the VPC endpoint configuration. You can also use these steps after troubleshooting any [runtime coverage issue](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/guardduty/latest/ug/runtime-monitoring-assessing-coverage.html) for a resource type. You can ensure that the steps worked as expected and the coverage status would potentially show up as **Healthy**.

Use the following steps to validate that VPC endpoint configuration for your resource type is set up correctly in the VPC owner account:

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon VPC console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/).

1. In the navigation pane, under **Virtual private cloud**, choose **Your VPCs**.

1. On the **Your VPCs** page, choose **IPv4 CIDR** associated with your **VPC ID**.

1. In the navigation pane, under **Virtual private cloud**, choose **Endpoints**.

1. In the **Endpoints** table, select the row that has the **Service name** similar to **com.amazonaws.{{us-east-1}}.guardduty-data**. The Region (`us-east-1`) might be different for your endpoint.

1. A panel for endpoint details will appear. Under the **Security Groups** tab, select the associated **Group ID** link for more details.

1. In the **Security Groups** table, select the row with the associated **Security group ID** to view the details.

1. Under the **Inbound rules** tab, ensure that there is an ingress policy with **Port range** as **443** and **Source** as the value copied from the **IPv4 CIDR**. Inbound rules control the incoming traffic that is allowed to reach the instance. The following image shows the inbound rules for a security group that is associated with the VPC used by the GuardDuty security agent.

   If you don't already have a security group that has an inbound port 443 enabled, [Create a security group](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/working-with-security-groups.html#creating-security-group) in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide*.

   If there is an issue while restricting the inbound permissions to your VPC (or cluster), allow inbound traffic on port 443 from any IP address (0.0.0.0/0).
