# Managing security agent manually for Amazon EC2 resource

This section provides the steps to manually install and update the security agent for your
Amazon EC2 resources.

After you enable Runtime Monitoring, you will need to install the GuardDuty security agent manually.
To manage the GuardDuty security agent manually, you must first create an Amazon VPC endpoint manually. After
this, you can install the security agent so that GuardDuty will start
receiving the runtime events from the Amazon EC2 instances. When
GuardDuty releases a new agent version for this resource, you can update the agent version in
your account.

The following topics include the steps to continuously manage the security agent for your
Amazon EC2 resources.
