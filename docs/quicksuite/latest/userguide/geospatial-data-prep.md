# Adding geospatial data

You can flag geographic fields in your data, so that Amazon Quick Sight can display them on a map.
Amazon Quick Sight can chart latitude and longitude coordinates. It also recognizes geographic
components such as country, state or region, county or district, city, and ZIP code or
postal code. You can also create geographic hierarchies that can disambiguate similar
entities, for example the same city name in two states.

###### Note

Geospatial charts in Amazon Quick Sight aren't currently supported in some AWS Regions,
including in China. We are working on adding support for more Regions.

Use the following procedures to add geospatial data types and hierarchies to your
dataset.

###### To add geospatial data types and hierarchies to your dataset

1. On the data preparation page, label the geographic components with the correct
   data type.

There are several ways to do this. One is to choose the field under
**Fields** and use the ellipses icon (**…**)
to open the context menu.

Then choose the correct geospatial data type.

You can also change the data type in the work area with the data sample. To do
this, choose the data type listed under the field name. Then choose the data type
you want to assign. 2. Verify that all geospatial fields necessary for mapping are labeled as geospatial
data types. You can check this by looking for the place marker icon. This icon
appears under the field names across the top of the page, and also in the
**Fields** pane on the left.

Also check the name of the data type, for example latitude or country. 3. (Optional) You can set up a hierarchy or grouping for geographical components
(state, city), or for latitude and longitude coordinates. For
coordinates, you must add both latitude and longitude to the geospatial field
wells.

To create a hierarchy or grouping, first choose one of these fields in the
**Fields** pane. Each field can only belong to one hierarchy.
It doesn't matter which one you choose first, or what order you add the fields in.

Choose the ellipsis icon (**…**) next to the field name. Then
choose **Add to a hierarchy**. 4. On the **Add field to hierarchy** screen, choose one of the
following:

    * Choose **Create a new geospatial hierarchy** to create a
     new grouping.
    * Choose **Add to existing geospatial hierarchy** to add a
     field to a grouping that already exists. The existing hierarchies displayed
     include only those of matching geospatial types.

Choose **Add** to confirm your choice. 5. On the **Create hierarchy** screen, name your hierarchy.

If you are creating a latitude and longitude grouping, the **Create
hierarchy** screen appears. Depending on whether you chose latitude or
longitude in the previous steps, either latitude or longitude displays on this
screen. Make sure that your latitude field shows under **Field to use for
latitude**. Also make sure that your longitude shows under
**Field to use for longitude**.

For geographical components, the **Create hierarchy** screen has
two choices:

    * Choose **This hierarchy is for a single country** if your
     data only contains one country. Choose the specific country from the list.
     Your data doesn't need to contain every level of the hierarchy. You can
     add fields to the hierarchy in any order.
    * Choose **This hierarchy is for multiple countries** if
     your data contains more than one country. Choose the field that contains the
     country names.

For either hierarchy type, choose **Update** to continue. 6. Continue by adding as many fields to the hierarchy as you need to.

Your geospatial groupings appear in the **Fields** pane.
