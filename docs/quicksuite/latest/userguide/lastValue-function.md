# lastValue

The `lastValue` function calculates the last value of the aggregated
measure or dimension partitioned and sorted by specified attributes.

## Syntax

The brackets are required. To see which arguments are optional, see the following
descriptions.

```
lastValue
	(
	     `aggregated measure or dimension`,
	     `[ sort_attribute ASC_or_DESC, ... ]`,
	     `[ partition_by_attribute, ... ]`
	)
```

## Arguments

_aggregated measure or dimension_

An aggregated measure or dimension that you want to see the last value
for.

_sort attribute_

One or more aggregated fields, either measures or dimensions or both,
that you want to sort the data by, separated by commas. You can either
specify ascending (`ASC`) or descending (`DESC`)
sort order.

Each field in the list is enclosed in {} (curly braces), if it's
more than one word. The entire list is enclosed in [ ] (square
brackets).

_partition by attribute_

(Optional) One or more measures or dimensions that you want to
partition by, separated by commas.

Each field in the list is enclosed in {} (curly braces), if it is more
than one word. The entire list is enclosed in [ ] (square brackets).

## Example

The following example calculates the last value for `Destination
 Airport`. This calculation is sorted by the `Flight Date` value
and partitioned by the `Flight Date` value sorted in ascending order and
the `Origin Airport` value.

```
lastValue(
    [{Destination Airport}],
    [{Flight Date} ASC],
    [
        {Origin Airport},
    	truncDate('DAY', {Flight Date})
    ]
)
```
