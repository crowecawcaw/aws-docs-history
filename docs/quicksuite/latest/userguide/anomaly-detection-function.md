# ML-powered anomaly detection for

outliers

The ML-powered anomaly detection computation searches your data for outliers.
For example, you can detect the top three outliers for total sales on January 3, 2019. If you enable contribution analysis, you can also detect the key drivers
for each outlier.

To use this function, you need at least one dimension in the
**Time** field well, at least one measure in the
**Values** field well, and at least one dimension in the
**Categories** field well. The configuration screen
provides an option to analyze the contribution of other fields as key drivers,
even if those fields aren't in the field wells.

For more information, see [Detecting outliers with ML-powered anomaly
detection](anomaly-detection.md "anomaly-detection.md").

###### Note

You can't add ML-powered anomaly detection to another computation, and you
can't add another computation to an anomaly detection.

## Computation

outputs

Each function generates a set of output parameters. You can add these
outputs to the autonarrative to customize what it displays. You can also add
your own custom text.

To locate the output parameters, open the
**Computations** tab on the right, and locate the
computation that you want to use. The names of the computations come from
the name that you provide when you create the insight. Choose the output
parameter by clicking on it only once. If you click twice, you add the same
output twice. You can use items displayed in **`bold monospace font`** following in the
narrative.

- `timeField` – From the **Time**
  field well.
  - `**name**`
    – The formatted display name of the field.
  - `**timeGranularity**` – The time
    field granularity (**DAY**,
    **YEAR**, and so on).

- `**categoryFields**`
  – From the **Categories** field well.
  - `**name**`
    – The formatted display name of the field.

- `metricField` – From the
  **Values** field well.
  - `**name**`
    – The formatted display name of the field.
  - `**aggregationFunction**` – The
    aggregation used for the metric (**SUM**,
    **AVG**, and so on).

- `**itemsCount**` –
  The number of items included in this computation.
- `**items**` –
  Anomalous items.
  - `timeValue` – The values in the date
    dimension.
    - `**value**` – The date/time
      field at the point of the anomaly (outlier).
    - `**formattedValue**` – The
      formatted value in the date/time field at the point
      of the anomaly.

  - `**categoryName**`
    – The actual name of the category (cat1, cat2, and so
    on).
  - `**direction**`
    – The direction on the x-axis or y-axis that's
    identified as anomalous: `HIGH` or
    `LOW`. `HIGH` means "higher than
    expected." `LOW` means "lower than expected."

  When iterating on items,
  `AnomalyDetection.items[index].direction` can
  contain either `HIGH` or `LOW`. For
  example,
  `AnomalyDetection.items[index].direction='HIGH'`
  or `AnomalyDetection.items[index].direction=LOW`.
  `AnomalyDetection.direction` can have an
  empty string for `ALL`. An example is
  `AnomalyDetection.direction=''`.
  - `actualValue` – The metric's actual
    value at the point of the anomaly or outlier.
    - `**value**` – The raw
      value.
    - `**formattedValue**` – The
      value formatted by the metric field.
    - `**formattedAbsoluteValue**` –
      The absolute value formatted by the metric
      field.

  - `expectedValue` – The metric's expected
    value at the point of the anomaly (outlier).
    - `**value**` – The raw
      value.
    - `**formattedValue**` – The
      value formatted by the metric field.
    - `**formattedAbsoluteValue**` –
      The absolute value formatted by the metric
      field.
