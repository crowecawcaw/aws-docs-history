# The expression editor

workspace

Use the expression editor to customize a narrative to best fit your business
needs. The information below provides an overview of the expression editor workspace
and lists all menu options that can be configured for your narrative. For a
walkthrough that shows you how to create a custom narrative, see [Use the narrative
expression editor](using-narratives-expression-editor-step-by-step.md "using-narratives-expression-editor-step-by-step.md").

On the right side of the screen, there's a list of items that you can add to the
narrative:

- **Computations** – Use this to choose from the
  computations that are available in this insight. You can expand this
  list.
- **Parameters** – Use this to choose from the
  parameters that exist in your analysis. You can expand this list.
- **Functions** – Use this to choose from functions
  that you can add to a narrative. You can expand this list.
- **Add computation** – Use this button to create
  another computation. New computations appear in the
  **Computations** list, ready to add to the
  insight.
  At the bottom of the narrative expression editor, there's a preview of the
  narrative that updates as you work. This area also shows an alert if you introduce
  an error into the narrative or if the narrative is empty. To see a preview of
  ML-powered insights like anomaly detection or forecasting, run your insight
  calculation at least once before customizing the narrative.

Editing tools are located across the top of the screen. They offer the following
options:

- **Insert code** – You can insert the following
  code blocks from this menu:

      + **Expressions** – Add a free-form
       expression.
      + **Inline IF** – Add an IF statement that
       displays inline with the existing block of text.
      + **Inline FOR** – Add a FOR statement that
       displays inline with the existing block of text.
      + **Block IF** – Add an IF statement that
       displays in a separate block of text.
      + **Block FOR** – Add a FOR statement that
       displays in a separate block of text.

  The IF and FOR statements enable you to create content that is
  conditionally formatted. For example, you might add a **block
  IF** statement, then configure it to compare an integer to a
  value from a calculation. To do this, you use the following steps, also
  demonstrated in [Use the narrative
  expression editor](using-narratives-expression-editor-step-by-step.md "using-narratives-expression-editor-step-by-step.md"):

      1. Open the calculations menu at right, and choose one of the blue
       highlighted items from one of the calculations. Doing this adds the
       item to the narrative.
      2. Click once on the item to open it.
      3. Enter the comparison that you want to make. The expression looks
       something like this:
       `PeriodOverPeriod.currentMetricValue.value>0`.
      4. Save this expression in the pop-up editor, which prompts you for
       **Conditional content**.
      5. Enter what you want to display in the insight, and format it as
       you want it to appear. Or if you prefer, you can add an image or a
       URL—or add a URL to an image.

- **Paragraph** – This menu offers options for
  changes to the font size:
  - **H1 Large header**
  - H2 Header
  - H3 Small header
  - ¶1 Large paragraph
  - ¶2 Paragraph
  - ¶3 Small paragraph

- **Font** – Use this menu tray to choose options
  for text formatting. These include bold, italic, underline, strikethrough,
  foreground color of the text (the letters themselves), and background color
  of the text. Choose the icon to turn on an option; choose it again to toggle
  the option off.
- **Formatting** – Use this menu tray to choose
  options for paragraph formatting, including bulleted list, left justify,
  center, and right justify. Choose the icon to turn on an option, choose it
  again to toggle the option off.
- **Image** – Use this icon add an image URL. The
  image displays in your insight, provided the link is accessible. You can
  resize images. To display an image based on a condition, put the image
  inside an IF block.
- **URL** – Use this icon to add a static or dynamic
  URL. You can also add URLs to images. For example, you can add traffic light
  indicator images to an insight for an executive dashboard, with links to a
  new sheet for red, amber, and green conditions.
