# Use the narrative

expression editor

The following walkthrough shows an example of how to customize a narrative. For
this example, we use a period over period computation type.

1. Begin with an existing analysis. Add a **period over
   period** insight to it. The easiest way to do this is to choose
   the + icon, then **Add insight**, then choose a type of
   insight from the list. To learn what type of computational insights you can
   add as autonarratives, see [Insights that include autonarratives](auto-narratives.md "auto-narratives.md").

After you choose a type of insight, choose **Select** to
create the widget. To create an empty narrative, close this screen without
choosing a template. To follow this example, choose **Period over
period**.

If you had a visual selected when you added the insight, the field wells
have preconfigured fields for the date, metric, and category. These come
from the visualization that you chose when you created the insight. You can
customize the fields as needed.

You can only customize a narrative for a new or existing insight
(text-based) widget. You can't add one to an existing visual (chart
based), because it's a different type of widget. 2. Edit the narrative in the expressions editor by choosing the on-visual
menu, then choosing **Customize narrative**.

In this context, **Computations** are predefined
calculations (period-over-period, period-to-date, growth rate, max, min, top
movers, and so on) that you can reference in your template to describe your
data. Currently, Amazon Quick Sight supports 13 different types of computations that
you can add to your insight. In this example,
**PeriodOverPeriod** is added by default because we
chose the **Period Over Period** template from the
suggested insights panel. 3. Choose **Add computation** at bottom right to add a new
computation, and then choose one from the list. For this walkthrough, choose
**Growth rate**, and then choose
**Next**. 4. Configure the computation by choosing the number of periods that you want
to compute over. The default is four, and that works for our example.
Optionally, you can change the name of the computation at the top of the
screen. However, for our purposes, leave the name unchanged.

###### Note

The computation names that you create are unique within the insight.
You can reference multiple computations of the same type in your
narrative template. For example, suppose that you have two metrics,
sales revenue and units sold. You can create growth rate computations
for each metric if they have different names.

However, anomaly computations aren't compatible with any other
computation type in the same widget. Anomaly detection must exist in an
insight by itself. To use other computations in the same analysis, put
them into insights separate from anomalies.

To proceed, choose **Add**. 5. Expand **Computations** on the right. The computations
that are part of the narrative display in the list. In this case, it's
**PeriodOverPeriod** and
**GrowthRate**. 6. In the workspace, add the following text after the final period:
`Compounded growth rate for the last`, then add a
space. 7. Next, to add the computation leave your cursor after the space after the
word **last**. On the right, under
**GrowthRate**, choose the expression named
**timePeriods** (click only once to add it).

Doing this inserts the expression
**GrowthRate.timePeriods**, which is the number of
periods you set in the configuration for **GrowthRate**. 8. Complete the sentence with `days is` (a space
before and afterwards), and add the expression
**GrowthRate.compoundedGrowthRate.formattedValue**,
followed by a period (`.`). Choose the expression from the list,
rather than typing it in. However, you can edit the contents of the
expression after you add it.

###### Note

The **formattedValue** expression returns a string
that is formatted based on the formatting applied for the metric on the
field. To perform metric math, use **value** instead,
which returns the raw value as an integer or decimal. 9. Add a conditional statement and formatting. Place your cursor at the end
of the template, after the `formattedValue` expression. Add a
space if necessary. On the **Edit narrative** menu bar,
choose **Insert code**, and then choose **Inline
IF** from the list. An expression block opens. 10. With the expression block open, choose **GrowthRate**,
**compoundedGrowthRate**, **value**
from the expression list. Enter `>0` at the end of the
expression. Choose **Save**. Don't move your cursor
yet.

A prompt appears for the conditional content; enter `better than
 expected!` Then select the text you just entered, and use the
formatting toolbar at the top to turn it green and bold. 11. Add another expression block for the case when the growth rate wasn't that
great by repeating the previous step. But this time, make it
`<0` and enter the text `worse than
 expected`. Make it red instead of green. 12. Choose **Save**. The customized narrative that we just
created should look similar to the following.

The expression editor provides you with a sophisticated tool to customize your
narratives. You can also reference the parameters you create for your analysis or
dashboard, and use a set of built-in functions for further customization.

###### Tip

To create an empty narrative, add an insight using the **+**
icon and then **Add insights**. But instead of choosing a
template, simply close the screen.

The best way to get started with customizing narratives is to use the existing
templates to learn the syntax.
