# Geospatial troubleshooting

Use this section to discover the Amazon Quick Sight requirements for correctly processing
geospatial data. If Amazon Quick Sight doesn't recognize your geospatial data as geospatial, use
this section to help troubleshoot the issue. Make sure that your data follows the
guidelines listed, so that it works in geospatial visuals.

###### Note

Geospatial charts in Amazon Quick Sight currently aren't supported in some AWS Regions,
including in China. We are working on adding support for more Regions.

If your geography follows all the guidelines listed here, and still generates
errors, contact the Amazon Quick Sight team from within the Amazon Quick Sight console.

## Geocoding issues

Amazon Quick Sight geocodes place names into latitude and longitude coordinates. It uses
these coordinates to display place names on the map. Amazon Quick Sight skips any places that
it can't geocode.

For this process to work properly, your data must include at least the country.
Also, there can't be duplicate place names inside of a parent place name.

A few issues prevent place names from showing up on a map chart. These issues
include unsupported, ambiguous, or invalid locations, as described following.

  areas](#geospatial-unsupported-areas "#geospatial-unsupported-areas")
- [Issues with ambiguous
  locations](#geospatial-ambiguous-locations "#geospatial-ambiguous-locations")
- [Issues with invalid geospatial
  data](#geospatial-invalid-data "#geospatial-invalid-data")
- [Issues with the default country in
  geocoding](#geospatial-default-country "#geospatial-default-country")

### Issues with unsupported

areas

To map unsupported locations, include latitude and longitude coordinates in
your data. Use these coordinates in the geospatial field well to make locations
show on a map chart.

### Issues with ambiguous

locations

Geospatial data can't contain ambiguous locations. For example, suppose that
the data contains a city named `Springfield`, but the next
level in the hierarchy is country. Because multiple states have a city named
`Springfield`, it isn't possible to geocode the
location to a specific point on a map.

To avoid this problem, you can add enough geographical data to indicate what
location should show on a map chart. For example, you can add a state level into
your data and its hierarchy. Or, you might add latitude and longitude.

### Issues with invalid geospatial

data

Invalid geospatial data occurs when a place name (a city, for example) is
listed under an incorrect parent (a state, for example). This issue might be a
simple misspelling, or data entry error.

###### Note

Amazon Quick Sight doesn't support regions (for example, West Coast or South) as
geospatial data. However, you can use a region as a filter in a
visual.

### Issues with the default country in

geocoding

Make sure that you are using the correct default country.

The default for each hierarchy is based on the country or country field that
you choose when you create the hierarchy.

To change this default, you can return to the **Create
hierarchy** screen. Then edit or create a hierarchy, and choose a
different country.

If you don't create a hierarchy, your default country is based on your
AWS Region. For details, see the following table.

| Region                                                                           | Default country |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| US West (Oregon) Region<br>US East (Ohio) Region<br>US East (N. Virginia) Region | US              |
| Asia Pacific (Singapore)                                                         | Singapore       |
| Asia Pacific (Sydney)                                                            | Australia       |
| Europe (Ireland) Region                                                          | Ireland         |

## Issues with latitude and longitude

Amazon Quick Sight uses latitude and longitude coordinates in the background to find place
names on a map. However, you can also use coordinates to create a map without using
place names. This approach also works with unsupported place names.

Latitude and longitude values must be numeric. For example, the map point
indicated by `28.5383355 -81.3792365` is compatible with
Amazon Quick Sight. But `28° 32' 18.0096'' N 81° 22' 45.2424'' W` is not.

###### Topics

- [Valid ranges for latitude and
  longitude coordinates](#valid-ranges-for-coordinates "#valid-ranges-for-coordinates")
- [Using coordinates in degrees,
  minutes, and seconds (DMS) format](#using-coordinates-in-dms-format "#using-coordinates-in-dms-format")

### Valid ranges for latitude and

longitude coordinates

Amazon Quick Sight supports latitude and longitude coordinates within specific ranges.

| Coordinate | Valid range         |
| ---------- | ------------------- |
| Latitude   | Between -90 and 90  |
| Longitude  | Between -180 to 180 |

Amazon Quick Sight skips any data outside these ranges. Out-of-range points can't be
mapped on a map chart.

### Using coordinates in degrees,

minutes, and seconds (DMS) format

You can use a calculated field with a formula to create a numeric latitude and
longitude out of character strings. Use this section to find different ways that
you can create calculated fields in Amazon Quick Sight, to parse GPS latitude and longitude
into numeric latitude and longitude.

The following sample converts latitude and longitude to numeric format from
separate fields. For example, suppose that you parse `51° 30'
 26.4636'' N 0° 7' 39.9288'' W` using space as a delimiter. In
this case, you can use something like the following sample to convert the
resulting fields to numeric latitude and longitude.

In this example, the seconds are followed by two single quotation marks. If
your data has a double quotation mark instead, then you can use
`strlen(LatSec)-1)` instead of
`strlen(LatSec)-2)`.

```
/*Latitude*/
        ifelse(
        LatDir = "N",
        parseInt(split(LatDeg, "°", 1)) +
            (parseDecimal(split(LatMin, "'", 1) ) /60) +
            (parseDecimal((substring(LatSec, 1, strlen(LatSec)-2) ) ) /3600),
        (parseInt(split(LatDeg, "°", 1)) +
            (parseDecimal(split(LatMin, "'", 1) ) /60) +
            (parseDecimal((substring(LatSec, 1, strlen(LatSec)-2) ) ) /3600)) * -1
        )

/*Longitude*/
        ifelse(
        LongDir = "E",
        parseInt(split(LongDeg, "°", 1)) +
            (parseDecimal(split(LongMin, "'", 1) ) /60) +
            (parseDecimal((substring(LongSec, 1, strlen(LongSec)-2) ) ) /3600),
        (parseInt(split(LongDeg, "°", 1)) +
            (parseDecimal(split(LongMin, "'", 1) ) /60) +
            (parseDecimal((substring(LongSec, 1, strlen(LongSec)-2) ) ) /3600)) * -1
        )
```

If your data doesn't include the symbols for degree, minute and second,
the formula looks like the following.

```
/*Latitude*/
    ifelse(
        LatDir = "N",
        (LatDeg + (LatMin / 60) + (LatSec / 3600)),
        (LatDeg + (LatMin / 60) + (LatSec / 3600)) * -1
    )

/*Longitude*/
    ifelse(
        LongDir = "E",
        (LongDeg + (LongMin / 60) + (LongSec / 3600)),
        (LongDeg + (LongMin / 60) + (LongSec / 3600)) * -1
    )
```

The following sample converts `53°21'N 06°15'W` to
numeric format. However, without the seconds, this location doesn't map as
accurately.

```
/*Latitude*/
ifelse(
    right(Latitude, 1) = "N",
    (parseInt(split(Latitude, '°', 1)) +
        parseDecimal(substring(Latitude, (locate(Latitude, '°',3)+1),  2) ) / 60) ,
    (parseInt(split(Latitude, '°', 1)) +
        parseDecimal(substring(Latitude, (locate(Latitude, '°',3)+1),  2) ) / 60) * -1
)

/*Longitude*/
ifelse(
    right(Longitude, 1) = "E",
    (parseInt(split(Longitude, '°', 1)) +
        parseDecimal(substring(Longitude, (locate(Longitude, '°',3)+1),  2) ) / 60) ,
    (parseInt(split(Longitude, '°', 1)) +
        parseDecimal(substring(Longitude, (locate(Longitude, '°',3)+1),  2) ) / 60) * -1
)
```

to match your data. For more information, see the following:
