# Integrating Amazon SageMaker AI models with Amazon Quick Sight

###### Note

You don't need any technical experience in machine learning (ML) to author analyses
and dashboards that use the ML-powered features in Amazon Quick Sight.

You can augment your Amazon Quick Suite Enterprise edition data with Amazon SageMaker AI machine learning
models. You can run inferences on data stored in SPICE imported from any data
source supported by Quick Suite. For a full list of supported data sources, see [Supported data sources](supported-data-sources.md "supported-data-sources.md").

Using Quick Suite with SageMaker AI models can save the time that you might otherwise spend
managing data movement and writing code. The results are useful both for evaluating the
model and—when you're satisfied with the results—for sharing with
decision-makers. You can begin immediately after the model is built. Doing this surfaces
your data scientists' prebuilt models, and enables you to apply the data science to your
datasets. Then you can share these insights in your predictive dashboards. With the
Quick Suite serverless approach, the process scales seamlessly, so you don't need
to worry about inference or query capacity.

Amazon Quick Suite supports SageMaker AI models that use regression and classification algorithms. You
can apply this feature to get predictions for just about any business use case. Some
examples include predicting the likelihood of customer churn, employee attrition, scoring
sales leads, and assessing credit risks. To use Quick Suite to provide predictions,
the SageMaker AI model data for both input and output must be in tabular format. In multiclass or
multilabel classification use cases, each output column has to contain a single value.
Quick Suite doesn’t support multiple values inside a single column.

## How SageMaker AI integration works

In general, the process works like this:

1. An Amazon Quick Suite administrator adds permissions for Quick Suite to access
   SageMaker AI. To do this, open **Security & Permissions** settings
   from the **Manage Quick Suite** page. Go to
   **Quick Suite access to AWS services**, and add
   SageMaker AI.

When you add these permissions, Quick Suite is added to an AWS Identity and Access Management
(IAM) role that provides access to list all the SageMaker AI models in your AWS
account. It also provides permissions to run SageMaker AI jobs that have names that are
prefixed with `quicksight-auto-generated-`. 2. We recommend that you connect to an SageMaker AI model that has an inference pipeline,
because it automatically performs data preprocessing. For more information, see
[Deploy an Inference Pipeline](../../../sagemaker/latest/dg/inference-pipelines.md "../../../sagemaker/latest/dg/inference-pipelines.md") in the _SageMaker AI
Developer Guide._ 3. After you identify the data and the pretrained model that you want to use
together, the owner of the model creates and provides a schema file. This JSON
file is a contract with SageMaker AI. It provides metadata about the fields, data types,
column order, output, and settings that the model expects. The optional settings
component provides the instance size and count of the compute instances to use
for the job.

If you're the data scientist who built the model, create this schema file
using the format documented following. If you're a consumer of the model,
get the schema file from the owner of the model. 4. In Quick Suite, you begin by creating a new dataset with the data that
you want to make predictions on. If you're uploading a file, you can add the
SageMaker AI model on the upload settings screen. Otherwise, add the model on the data
preparation page.

Before you proceed, verify the mappings between the dataset and the
model. 5. After the data is imported into the dataset, the output fields contain the
data returned from SageMaker AI. You use these fields just as you use other fields,
within the guidelines described in [Usage guidelines](#sagemaker-usage-guidelines "#sagemaker-usage-guidelines").

When you run SageMaker AI integration, Quick Suite passes a request to SageMaker AI to
run batch transform jobs with inference pipelines. Quick Suite starts
provisions and deployment of the instances needed in your AWS account. When
processing is complete, these instances are shut down and terminated. The
compute capacity incurs costs only when it's processing models.

To make it easier for you to identify them, Quick Suite names all its
SageMaker AI jobs with the prefix `quicksight-auto-generated-`. 6. The output of the inference is stored in SPICE and appended to
the dataset. As soon as the inference is complete, you can use the dataset to
create visualizations and dashboards using the prediction data. 7. The data refresh starts every time you save the dataset. You can start the
data refresh process manually by refreshing the SPICE dataset, or
you can schedule it to run at a regular interval. During each data refresh, the
system automatically calls SageMaker AI batch transform to update the output fields with
new data.

You can use the Amazon Quick Sight SPICE ingestion API operations to
control the data refresh process. For more information about using these API
operations, see the [Amazon Quick Sight API Reference](../../../quicksight/latest/APIReference/qs-api-overview.md "../../../quicksight/latest/APIReference/qs-api-overview.md").

## Costs incurred (no additional costs with

integration itself)

Using this feature doesn't require an additional fee in itself. Your costs include the
following:

- The cost of model deployment through SageMaker AI, which is incurred only when the
  model is running. Saving a dataset—after either creating or editing
  it—or refreshing its data starts the data ingestion process. This process
  includes calling SageMaker AI if the dataset has inferred fields. Costs are incurred in
  the same AWS account where your Quick Suite subscription is.
- Your Quick Suite subscription costs are as follows:
  - The cost of storing your data in the in-memory calculation engine in
    Quick Suite (SPICE). If you are adding new data to
    SPICE, you might need to purchase enough
    SPICE capacity to accommodate it.
  - Quick Suite subscriptions for the authors or admins who build
    the datasets.
  - Pay-per-session charges for viewers (readers) to access interactive
    dashboards.

## Usage guidelines

In Amazon Quick Suite, the following usage guidelines apply to this Enterprise edition
feature:

- The processing of the model occurs in SPICE. Therefore, it can
  only apply to datasets that are stored in SPICE. The process
  currently supports up to 500 million rows per dataset.
- Only Quick Suite admins or authors can augment datasets with ML models.
  Readers can only view the results when they are part of a dashboard.
- Each dataset can work with one and only one ML model.
- Output fields can't be used to calculate new fields.
- Datasets can't be filtered by fields that are integrated with the model. In
  other words, if your dataset field is currently mapped to the ML model, you
  can't filter on that field.

In SageMaker AI, the following usage guidelines apply to a pretrained model that you use with
Amazon Quick Sight:

- When you create the model, associate it with the Amazon Resource Name (ARN)
  for the appropriate IAM role. The IAM role for the SageMaker AI model needs to have
  access to the Amazon S3 bucket that Amazon Quick Sight uses.
- Make sure that your model supports .csv files for both input and output. Make
  sure that your data is in a tabular format.
- Provide a schema file that contains metadata about the model, including the
  list of input and output fields. Currently, you must create this schema file
  manually.
- Consider the amount of time that it takes to complete your inference, which
  depends on a number of factors. These include the complexity of the model, the
  amount of data, and the compute capacity defined. Completing the inference can
  take several minutes to several hours. Amazon Quick Sight caps all data ingestion and
  inferencing jobs to a maximum of 10 hours. To reduce the time it takes to
  perform an inference, consider increasing the instance size or the number of
  instances.
- Currently, you can use only batch transforms for integration with SageMaker AI, not
  real-time data. You can't use an SageMaker AI endpoint.

## Defining the schema file

Before you use an SageMaker AI model with Quick Sight data, create the JSON schema file that
contains the metadata that Amazon Quick Sight needs to process the model. The Amazon Quick Suite author
or admin uploads the schema file when configuring the dataset.

The schema fields are defined as follows. All fields are required unless specified in
the following description. Attributes are case-sensitive.

_inputContentType_

The content type that this SageMaker AI model expects for the input data. The only
supported value for this is `"text/csv"`. Quick Sight
doesn't include any of the header names that you add to the input
file.

_outputContentType_

The content type of the output that is produced by the SageMaker AI model that you
want to use. The only supported value for this is
`"text/csv"`.

_input_

A list of features that the model expects in the input data. Quick Sight
produces the input data in exactly the same order. This list contains the
following attributes:

- _name_ – The name of the column. If
  possible, make this the same as the name of the corresponding column
  in the QuickSight dataset. This attribute is limited to 100
  characters.
- _type_ – The data type of this column.
  This attribute takes the values `"INTEGER"`,
  `"STRING"`, and
  `"DECIMAL"`.
- _nullable_ – (Optional) The nullability of
  the field. The default value is `true`. If you set
  `nullable` to `false`, Quick Sight drops
  rows that don't contain this value before calling SageMaker AI. Doing
  this helps avoid causing SageMaker AI to fail on missing required data.

_output_

A list of output columns that the SageMaker AI model produces. Quick Sight
expects these fields in exactly the same order. This list contains the
following attributes:

- _name_ – This name becomes the default
  name for the corresponding new column that's created in
  Quick Sight. You can override the name specified here in
  Quick Sight. This attribute is limited to 100 characters.
- _type_ – The data type of this column.
  This attribute takes the values `"INTEGER"`,
  `"STRING"`, and
  `"DECIMAL"`.

_instanceTypes_

A list of the ML instance types that SageMaker AI can provision to run the
transform job. The list is provided to the Amazon Quick Suite user to choose from.
This list is limited to the types supported by SageMaker AI. For more information on
supported types, see [TransformResources](../../../sagemaker/latest/dg/API_TransformResources.md "../../../sagemaker/latest/dg/API_TransformResources.md") in the _SageMaker AI
Developer Guide._

_defaultInstanceType_

(Optional) The instance type that is presented as the default option in
the SageMaker AI wizard in Quick Sight. Include this instance type in
`instanceTypes`.

_instanceCount_

(Optional) The instance count defines how many of the selected instances
for SageMaker AI to provision to run the transform job. This value must be a
positive integer.

_description_

This field provides a place for the person who owns the SageMaker AI model to
communicate with the person who is using this model in Quick Sight. Use
this field to provide hints about successfully using this model. For
example, this field can contain information about selecting an effective
instance type to choose from the list in `instanceTypes`, based
on the size of dataset. This field is limited to 1,000 characters.

_version_

The version of the schema, for example
"`1.0"`.

The following example shows the structure of the JSON in the schema file.

```
{
        "inputContentType": "CSV",
        "outputContentType": "CSV",
        "input": [
            {
                "name": "buying",
                "type": "STRING"
            },
            {
                "name": "maint",
                "type": "STRING"
            },
            {
                "name": "doors",
                "type": "INTEGER"
            },
            {
                "name": "persons",
                "type": "INTEGER"
            },
            {
                "name": "lug_boot",
                "type": "STRING"
            },
            {
                "name": "safety",
                "type": "STRING"
            }
        ],
        "output": [
            {
                "name": "Acceptability",
                "type": "STRING"
            }
        ],
        "description": "Use ml.m4.xlarge instance for small datasets, and ml.m4.4xlarge for datasets over 10 GB",
        "version": "1.0",
        "instanceCount": 1,
        "instanceTypes": [
            "ml.m4.xlarge",
            "ml.m4.4xlarge"
        ],
        "defaultInstanceType": "ml.m4.xlarge"
    }
```

The structure of the schema file is related to the kind of model that is used in
examples provided by SageMaker AI.

## Adding a SageMaker AI model to your Quick Sight

dataset

Using the following procedure, you can add a pretrained SageMaker AI model to your dataset, so
that you can use predictive data in analyses and dashboards.

Before you begin, have the following items available:

- The data that you want to use to build the dataset.
- The name of the SageMaker AI model that you want to use to augment the dataset.
- The schema of the model. This schema includes field name mappings and data
  types. It's helpful if it also contains recommended settings for instance type
  and number of instances to use.

###### To augment your Amazon Quick Sight dataset with SageMaker AI

1. Create a new dataset from the start page by choosing
   **Datasets**, and then choose **New
   dataset**.

You can also edit an existing dataset. 2. Choose **Augment with SageMaker** on the data preparation
screen. 3. For **Select your model**, choose the following
settings:

    * **Model** – Choose the SageMaker AI model to use to
     infer fields.
    * **Name** – Provide a descriptive name for the
     model.
    * **Schema** – Upload the JSON schema file
     provided for the model.
    * **Advanced settings** – QuickSight recommends
     the selected defaults based on your dataset. You can use specific
     runtime settings to balance the speed and cost of your job. To do this,
     enter the SageMaker AI ML instance types for **Instance type**
     and number of instances for **Count**.

Choose **Next** to continue. 4. For **Review inputs**, review the fields that are mapped to
your dataset. Quick Sight attempts to automatically map the fields in your
schema to the fields in your dataset. You can make changes here if the mapping
needs adjustment.

Choose **Next** to continue. 5. For **Review outputs**, view the fields that are added to
your dataset.

Choose **Save and prepare data** to confirm your
choices. 6. To refresh the data, choose the dataset to view details. Then either choose
**Refresh Now** to manually refresh the data, or choose
**Schedule refresh** to set up a regular refresh interval.
During each data refresh, the system automatically runs the SageMaker AI batch transform
job to update the output fields with new data.
