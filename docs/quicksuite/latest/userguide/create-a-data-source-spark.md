# Creating a data source using Apache

Spark

You can connect directly to Apache Spark using Quick Sight, or you can connect to
Spark through Spark SQL. Using the results of queries, or direct links to tables or
views, you create data sources in Quick Sight. You can either directly query your data
through Spark, or you can import the results of your query into [SPICE](spice.md "spice.md").

Before you use Quick Sight with Spark products, you must configure Spark for
Quick Sight.

Quick Sight requires your Spark server to be secured and authenticated using LDAP,
which is available to Spark version 2.0 or later. If Spark is configured to allow
unauthenticated access, Quick Sight refuses the connection to the server. To use
Quick Sight as a Spark client, you must configure LDAP authentication to work with
Spark.

The Spark documentation contains information on how to set this up. To start, you need
to configure it to enable front-end LDAP authentication over HTTPS. For general
information on Spark, see [the Apache spark
website](http://spark.apache.org/ "http://spark.apache.org/"). For information specifically on Spark and security, see [Spark security
documentation](http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/security.html "http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/security.html").

To make sure that you have configured your server for Quick Sight access, follow the
instructions in [Network and database configuration requirements](configure-access.md "configure-access.md").
