# Granting anyone on

the internet access to an Amazon Quick Sight dashboard using the Quick Sight
API

Alternatively, you can grant anyone on the internet access to the dashboard
with the Amazon Quick Sight API using the `UpdateDashboardPermissions`
operation.

Before you begin, make sure to grant everyone in your account access to the
dashboard. For more information, see [Granting everyone
in your Amazon Quick Suite account access to a dashboard with the Quick Sight
API](share-a-dashboard-grant-access-everyone-api.md "share-a-dashboard-grant-access-everyone-api.md").

The following example API request illustrates how to grant anyone on the
internet access to a dashboard using an AWS CLI command. It grants link
permissions on the dashboard in your account, and allows the following
operations: `DescribeDashboard`, `QueryDashboard` and
`ListDashboardVersions`.

```
aws quicksight update-dashboard-permissions
--aws-account-id `account-id`
--region `aws-directory-region`
--dashboard-id `dashboard-id`
--grant-link-permissions
Principal="arn:aws:quicksight:::publicAnonymousUser/*",
Actions="quicksight:DescribeDashboard, quicksight:QueryDashboard,
quicksight:ListDashboardVersions"
```

The response for the preceding request looks similar to the following.

```
{
    "Status": 200,
    "DashboardArn": "arn:aws:quicksight:AWSDIRECTORYREGION:ACCOUNTID:dashboard/
    DASHBOARDID",
    "DashboardId": "DASHBOARDID",
    "LinkSharingConfiguration": {
        "Permissions": [
            {
                "Actions": [
                    "quicksight:DescribeDashboard",
                    "quicksight:ListDashboardVersions",
                    "quicksight:QueryDashboard"
                ],
                "Principal": "arn:aws:quicksight:AWSDIRECTORYREGION:ACCOUNTID:namespace/default"
            },
                "Principal": "arn:aws:quicksight:::publicAnonymousUser/*",
                "Actions": [
                    "quicksight:DescribeDashboard",
                    "quicksight:ListDashboardVersions",
                    "quicksight:QueryDashboard"
                ]
            }
        ]
    },
    "Permissions": [
        // other dashboard permissions here
    ],
    "RequestId": "REQUESTID"
}

```

You can also prevent anyone on the internet from accessing the dashboard using
the same API operation. The following example request illustrates how by using a
CLI command.

```
aws quicksight update-dashboard-permissions \
--aws-account-id `account-id` \
--region `aws-directory-region` \
--dashboard-id `dashboard-id` \
--revoke-link-permissions
Principal="arn:aws:quicksight:::publicAnonymousUser/*",
Actions="quicksight:DescribeDashboard, quicksight:QueryDashboard,
quicksight:ListDashboardVersions"
```

For more information, see [UpdateDashboardPermissions](../../../quicksight/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateDashboardPermissions.md "../../../quicksight/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateDashboardPermissions.md") in the
_Amazon Quick Suite API Reference_.

When anyone on the internet is granted access to the dashboard, the following
snippet is added to AWS CloudTrail log as part of the `eventName`
`UpdateDashboardAccess`, and the `eventCategory`
`Management`.

```
"linkPermissionPolicies":
	[
		{
			"principal": "arn:aws:quicksight:::publicAnonymousUser/*",
			"actions":
			[
				"quicksight:DescribeDashboard",
				"quicksight:ListDashboardVersions",
				"quicksight:QueryDashboard"
			]
		}
	]
```
