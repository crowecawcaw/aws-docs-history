| Intended audience:<br>Amazon Quick Suite Administrators and Amazon Quick Suite developers |

When you embed Amazon Quick Suite dashboards in your application for users who are not
provisioned (registered) in Quick Suite, you can use row-level security (RLS) with tags.
In this case, you use tags to specify which data your users can see in the dashboard
depending on who they are.

For example, let's say you're a logistics company that has a customer-facing
application for various retailers. Thousands of users from these retailers access your
application to see metrics related to how their orders are getting shipped from your
warehouse.

You don't want to manage thousands of users in Quick Suite, so you use anonymous
embedding to embed the selected dashboards in your application that your authenticated
and authorized users can see. However, you want to make sure retailers see only data
that is for their business and not for others. You can use RLS with tags to make sure
your customers only see data that's relevant to them.

To do so, complete the following steps:

1. Add RLS tags to a dataset.
2. Assign values to those tags at runtime using the
   `GenerateEmbedUrlForAnonymousUser` API operation.

For more information about embedding dashboards for anonymous users using the
`GenerateEmbedUrlForAnonymousUser` API operation, see [Embedding Amazon Quick Sight
dashboards for anonymous (unregistered) users](embedded-analytics-dashboards-for-everyone.md "embedded-analytics-dashboards-for-everyone.md").
Before you can use RLS with tags, keep in mind the following points:

- Using RLS with tags is currently only supported for anonymous embedding,
  specifically for embedded dashboards that use the
  `GenerateEmbedUrlForAnonymousUser` API operation.
- Using RLS with tags isn't supported for embedded dashboards that use the
  `GenerateEmbedURLForRegisteredUser` API operation or the old
  `GetDashboardEmbedUrl` API operation.
- RLS tags aren't supported with AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) or the Quick Suite
  identity type.
- When applying SPICE datasets to row-level security, each field in the dataset
  can contain up to 2,047 Unicode characters. Fields that contain more than this
  quota are truncated during ingestion. To learn more about SPICE data quotas, see
  [SPICE quotas for imported data](data-source-limits.md#spice-limits "data-source-limits.md#spice-limits").

## Step 1: Add RLS tags to a

dataset

You can add tag-based rules to a dataset in Amazon Quick Suite. Alternatively, you can call
the `CreateDataSet` or `UpdateDataSet` API operation and add
tag-based rules that way. For more information, see [Add RLS tags to a dataset
using the API](#quicksight-dev-rls-tags-add-api "#quicksight-dev-rls-tags-add-api").

Use the following procedure to add RLS tags to a dataset in Quick Suite.

###### To add RLS tags to a dataset

1. From the Quick Suite start page, choose **Data** at
   left.
2. Choose the dataset that you want to add RLS to.
3. On the dataset details page that opens, for **Row-level
   security**, choose **Set up**.
4. On the **Set up row-level security** page that opens,
   choose **Tag-based rules**.
5. For **Column**, choose a column that you want to add tag
   rules to.

For example, in the case for the logistics company, the
`retailer_id` column is used.

Only columns with a string data type are listed. 6. For **Tag**, enter a tag key. You can enter any tag name
that you want.

For example, in the case for the logistics company, the tag key
`tag_retailer_id` is used. Doing this sets row-level security
based on the retailer that's accessing the application. 7. (Optional) For **Delimiter**, choose a delimiter from the
list, or enter your own.

You can use delimiters to separate text strings when assigning more than
one value to a tag. The value for a delimiter can be 10 characters long, at
most. 8. (Optional) For **Match all**, choose the
**\***, or enter your own character or
characters.

This option can be any character that you want to use when you want to
filter by all the values in that column in the dataset. Instead of listing
the values one by one, you can use the character. If this value is
specified, it can be at least one character, or at most 256 characters
long. 9. Choose **Add**.

The tag rule is added to the dataset and is listed at the bottom, but it
isn't applied yet. To add another tag rule to the dataset, repeat steps
5–9. To edit a tag rule, choose the pencil icon that follows the
rule. To delete a tag rule, choose the delete icon that follows the rule.
You can add up to 50 tags to a dataset. 10. When you're ready to apply the tag rules to the dataset, choose
**Apply rules**. 11. On the **Turn on tag-based security?** page that opens,
choose **Apply and activate**.

The tag-based rules are now active. On the **Set up row-level
security**page, a toggle appears for you to turn tag rules on
and off for the dataset.

To turn off all tag-based rules for the dataset, switch the
**Tag-Based rules** toggle off, and then enter
"confirm" in the text box that appears.

On the **Data** page, a lock icon appears in the dataset
row to indicate that tag rules are enabled.

You can now use tag rules to set tag values at runtime, described in [Step 2: Assign values to RLS
tags at runtime](#quicksight-dev-rls-tags-assign-values "#quicksight-dev-rls-tags-assign-values"). The rules only
affect Quick Suite readers when active.

###### Important

After tags are assigned and enabled on the dataset, make sure to give
Quick Suite authors permissions to see any of the data in the dataset
when authoring a dashboard.

To give Quick Suite authors permission to see data in the dataset,
create a permissions file or query to use as dataset rules. For more
information, see [Creating dataset
rules for row-level security](restrict-access-to-a-data-set-using-row-level-security.md#create-data-set-rules-for-row-level-security "restrict-access-to-a-data-set-using-row-level-security.md#create-data-set-rules-for-row-level-security").

After you create a tag-based rule, a new **Manage rules** table
appears that shows how your tag-based rules relate to each other. To make changes to
the rules listed in the **Manage rules** table, choose the pencil
icon that follows the rule. Then add or remove tags, and choose
**Update**. To apply your updated rule to the dataset, choose
**Apply**.

### (Optional) Add the OR condition to

RLS tags

You can also add the OR condition to your tag-based rules to further customize
the way data is presented to your Quick Suite account users. When you use the OR
condition with your tag-based rules, visuals in Quick Suite appear if at least
one tag defined in the rule is valid.

###### To add the OR condition to your tag-based rules

1. In the **Manage rules** table, choose **Add
   OR condition**.
2. In the **Select tag** dropdown list that appears,
   choose the tag that you want to create an OR condition for. You can add
   up to 50 OR conditions to the **Manage rules** table.
   You can add multiple tags to a single column in a dataset, but at least
   one column tag needs to be included in a rule.
3. Choose **Update** to add the condition to your rule,
   then choose **Apply** to apply the updated rule to your
   dataset.

### Add RLS tags to a dataset

using the API

Alternatively, you can configure and enable tag-based row-level security on
your dataset by calling the `CreateDataSet` or
`UpdateDataSet` API operation. Use the following examples to
learn how.

CreateDataSet
The following is an example for creating a dataset that uses RLS
with tags. It assumes the scenario of the logistics company
described previously. The tags are defined in the
`row-level-permission-tag-configuration` element. The
tags are defined on the columns that you want to secure the data
for. For more information about this optional element, see [RowLevelPermissionTagConfiguration](../../../quicksight/latest/APIReference/API_RowLevelPermissionTagConfiguration.md "../../../quicksight/latest/APIReference/API_RowLevelPermissionTagConfiguration.md") in the
_Amazon Quick Suite API Reference_.

```
create-data-set
		--aws-account-id <value>
		--data-set-id <value>
		--name <value>
		--physical-table-map <value>
		[--logical-table-map <value>]
		--import-mode <value>
		[--column-groups <value>]
		[--field-folders <value>]
		[--permissions <value>]
		[--row-level-permission-data-set <value>]
		[--column-level-permission-rules <value>]
		[--tags <value>]
		[--cli-input-json <value>]
		[--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]
		[--row-level-permission-tag-configuration
	'{
		"Status": "ENABLED",
		"TagRules":
			[
				{
					"TagKey": "`tag_retailer_id`",
					"ColumnName": "`retailer_id`",
					"TagMultiValueDelimiter": "`,`",
					"MatchAllValue": "`*`"
				},
				{
					"TagKey": "`tag_role`",
					"ColumnName": "`role`"
				}
			],
		"TagRuleConfigurations":
			[
				`tag_retailer_id`
			],
			[
				`tag_role`
			]
	}'
]
```

The tags in this example are defined in the `TagRules`
part of the element. In this example, two tags are defined based on
two columns:

- The `tag_retailer_id` tag key is defined for
  the `retailer_id` column. In this case for the
  logistics company, this sets row-level security based on the
  retailer that's accessing the application.
- The `tag_role` tag key is defined for the
  `role` column. In this case for the logistics
  company, this sets an additional layer of row-level security
  based on the role of the user accessing your application
  from a specific retailer. An example is
  `store_supervisor` or
  `manager`.

For each tag, you can define `TagMultiValueDelimiter`
and `MatchAllValue`. These are optional.

- `TagMultiValueDelimiter` – This option
  can be any string that you want to use to delimit the values
  when you pass them at runtime. The value can be 10
  characters long, at most. In this case, a comma is used as
  the delimiter value.
- `MatchAllValue` – This option can be any
  character that you want to use when you want to filter by
  all the values in that column in the dataset. Instead of
  listing the values one by one, you can use the character. If
  specified, this value can be at least one character, or at
  most 256 characters long. In this case, an asterisk is used
  as the match all value.

While configuring the tags for dataset columns, turn them on or
off using the mandatory property `Status`. For enabling
the tag rules use the value `ENABLED` for this property.
By turning on tag rules, you can use them to set tag values at
runtime, described in [Step 2: Assign values to RLS
tags at runtime](#quicksight-dev-rls-tags-assign-values "#quicksight-dev-rls-tags-assign-values").

The following is an example of the response definition.

```
{
			"Status": 201,
			"Arn": "arn:aws:quicksight:us-west-2:11112222333:dataset/RLS-Dataset",
			"DataSetId": "RLS-Dataset",
			"RequestId": "aa4f3c00-b937-4175-859a-543f250f8bb2"
		}
```

UpdateDataSet
**UpdateDataSet**

You can use the `UpdateDataSet` API operation to add or
update RLS tags for an existing dataset.

The following is an example of updating a dataset with RLS tags.
It assumes the scenario of the logistics company described
previously.

```
update-data-set
		--aws-account-id <value>
		--data-set-id <value>
		--name <value>
		--physical-table-map <value>
		[--logical-table-map <value>]
		--import-mode <value>
		[--column-groups <value>
		[--field-folders <value>]
		[--row-level-permission-data-set <value>]
		[--column-level-permission-rules <value>]
		[--cli-input-json <value>]
		[--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]
				[--row-level-permission-tag-configuration
	'{
		"Status": "ENABLED",
		"TagRules":
			[
				{
					"TagKey": "`tag_retailer_id`",
					"ColumnName": "`retailer_id`",
					"TagMultiValueDelimiter": "`,`",
					"MatchAllValue": "`*`"
				},
				{
					"TagKey": "`tag_role`",
					"ColumnName": "`role`"
				}
			],
		"TagRuleConfigurations":
			[
				`tag_retailer_id`
			],
			[
				`tag_role`
			]
	}'
]
```

The following is an example of the response definition.

```
{
			"Status": 201,
			"Arn": "arn:aws:quicksight:us-west-2:11112222333:dataset/RLS-Dataset",
			"DataSetId": "RLS-Dataset",
			"RequestId": "aa4f3c00-b937-4175-859a-543f250f8bb2"
		}
```

###### Important

After tags are assigned and enabled on the dataset, make sure to give
Quick Suite authors permissions to see any of the data in the dataset when
authoring a dashboard.

To give Quick Suite authors permission to see data in the dataset, create a
permissions file or query to use as dataset rules. For more information, see
[Creating dataset
rules for row-level security](restrict-access-to-a-data-set-using-row-level-security.md#create-data-set-rules-for-row-level-security "restrict-access-to-a-data-set-using-row-level-security.md#create-data-set-rules-for-row-level-security").

For more information about the `RowLevelPermissionTagConfiguration`
element, see [RowLevelPermissionTagConfiguration](../../../quicksight/latest/APIReference/API_RowLevelPermissionTagConfiguration.md "../../../quicksight/latest/APIReference/API_RowLevelPermissionTagConfiguration.md") in the
_Amazon Quick Suite API Reference_.

## Step 2: Assign values to RLS

tags at runtime

You can use tags for RLS only for anonymous embedding. You can set values for tags
using the `GenerateEmbedUrlForAnonymousUser` API operation.

The following example shows how to assign values to RLS tags that were defined in
the dataset in the previous step.

```
POST /accounts/`AwsAccountId`/embed-url/anonymous-user
	HTTP/1.1
	Content-type: application/json
	{
		“AwsAccountId”: “string”,
		“SessionLifetimeInMinutes”: integer,
		“Namespace”: “string”, // The namespace to which the anonymous end user virtually belongs
		“SessionTags”:  // Optional: Can be used for row-level security
			[
				{
					“Key”: “tag_retailer_id”,
					“Value”: “West,Central,South”
				}
				{
					“Key”: “tag_role”,
					“Value”: “shift_manager”
				}
			],
		“AuthorizedResourceArns”:
			[
				“string”
			],
		“ExperienceConfiguration”:
			{
				“Dashboard”:
					{
						“InitialDashboardId”: “string”
						// This is the initial dashboard ID the customer wants the user to land on. This ID goes in the output URL.
					}
			}
	}
```

The following is an example of the response definition.

```
HTTP/1.1 Status
	Content-type: application/json

	{
	"EmbedUrl": "`string`",
	"RequestId": "`string`"
	}
```

RLS support without registering users in Quick Suite is supported only in the
`GenerateEmbedUrlForAnonymousUser` API operation. In this operation,
under `SessionTags`, you can define the values for the tags associated
with the dataset columns.

In this case, the following assignments are defined:

- Values `West`, `Central`, and `South` are
  assigned to the `tag_retailer_id` tag at runtime. A comma is used
  for the delimiter, which was defined in
  `TagMultipleValueDelimiter` in the dataset. To use call
  values in the column, you can set the value to \*\*\*, which
  was defined as the `MatchAllValue` when creating the tag.
- The value `shift_manager` is assigned to the
  `tag_role` tag.

The user using the generated URL can view only the rows having the
`shift_manager` value in the `role` column. That user can
view only the value `West`, `Central`, or `South`
in the `retailer_id` column.

`GenerateEmbedUrlForAnonymousUser` API operation, see [Embedding Amazon Quick Sight
dashboards for anonymous (unregistered) users](embedded-analytics-dashboards-for-everyone.md "embedded-analytics-dashboards-for-everyone.md"), or [GenerateEmbedUrlForAnonymousUser](../../../quicksight/latest/APIReference/API_GenerateEmbedUrlForAnonymousUser.md "../../../quicksight/latest/APIReference/API_GenerateEmbedUrlForAnonymousUser.md") in the
