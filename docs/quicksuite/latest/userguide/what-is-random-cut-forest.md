# What is RCF?

A _random cut forest_ (RCF) is a special type of
_random forest_ (RF) algorithm, a widely used
and successful technique in machine learning. It takes a set of random data points,
cuts them down to the same number of points, and then builds a collection of models.
In contrast, a model corresponds to a decision tree—thus the name forest.
Because RFs can't be easily updated in an incremental manner, RCFs were invented
with variables in tree construction that were designed to allow incremental updates.

As an unsupervised algorithm, RCF uses cluster analysis to detect spikes in time
series data, breaks in periodicity or seasonality, and data point exceptions. Random
cut forests can work as a synopsis or sketch of a dynamic data stream (or a
time-indexed sequence of numbers). The answers to our questions about the stream
come out of that synopsis. The following characteristics address the stream and how
we make connections to anomaly detection and forecasting:

- A _streaming algorithm_ is an online
  algorithm with a small memory footprint. An online algorithm makes its
  decision about the input point indexed by time **t** before it sees the **(t+1)-**st point. The small memory allows nimble algorithms that
  can produce answers with low latency and allow a user to interact with the
  data.
- Respecting the ordering imposed by time, as in an _online_ algorithm, is necessary in anomaly detection and
  forecasting. If we already know what will happen the day after tomorrow,
  then predicting what happens tomorrow isn't a forecast—it's just
  interpolating an unknown missing value. Similarly, a new product introduced
  today can be an anomaly, but it doesn't necessarily remain an anomaly at the
  end of the next quarter.
