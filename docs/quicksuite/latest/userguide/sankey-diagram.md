# Using Sankey diagrams

Use Sankey diagrams to show flows from one category to another, or paths from one
stage to the next.

For example, a Sankey diagram can show the number of people migrating from one country
to another. A Sankey diagram can also show the path a web visitor takes from one page to
the next on a company website, with possible stops along the way.

## Data for Sankey diagrams

To create Sankey diagrams in Quick Suite, your dataset should contain a
measure and two dimensions (one dimension containing source categories and another
containing destination categories).

The following table is a simple example of data for a Sankey diagram.

| Dimension (Source) | Dimension (Destination) | Measure (Weight) |
| ------------------ | ----------------------- | ---------------- |
| A                  | W                       | 500              |
| A                  | X                       | 23               |
| A                  | Y                       | 147              |

The following Sankey diagram is created when the dimensions and measure are added
to the field well, with the A node on the left linking to the W, Y, and X nodes on
the right. The width of each link between nodes is determined by the value in the
Measure (Weight) column. The nodes are automatically ordered.

To create multilevel Sankey diagrams in Amazon Quick Suite, your dataset should still
contain a measure and two dimensions (one for source and one for destination), but
in this case your data values differ.

The following table is a simple example of data for a multilevel Sankey diagram
with two stages.

| Dimension (Source) | Dimension (Destination) | Measure (Weight) |
| ------------------ | ----------------------- | ---------------- |
| A                  | W                       | 500              |
| A                  | X                       | 23               |
| A                  | Y                       | 147              |
| W                  | Z                       | 300              |
| X                  | Z                       | 5                |
| Y                  | Z                       | 50               |

The following Sankey diagram is created when the dimensions and measure are added
to the field well. Here, the A node on the left links to the W, Y, and X nodes in
the middle, and the W, Y, and X nodes then link to the Z node on the right. The
width of each link between nodes is determined by the value in the Measure (Weight)
column.

### Working with cyclical data

Sometimes, the data that you use for a Sankey diagram contains cycles. For
example, suppose that you're visualizing user traffic flows between pages
on a website. You might discover that users who come to page A move to page E,
and then come back to page A. An entire flow might look something like
A-E-A-B-A-E-A.

When your data contains cycles, the nodes in each cycle are repeated in
Quick Suite. For example, if your data contains the flow A-E-A-B-A-E-A,
the following Sankey diagram is created.

## Preparing data for Sankey diagrams

If your dataset doesn't contain Source or Destination columns, prepare your
data to include them. You can prepare data when creating a new dataset, or when
editing an existing dataset. For more information about creating a new dataset and
preparing it, see [Creating datasets](creating-data-sets.md "creating-data-sets.md"). For more information about opening an
existing dataset for data preparation, see [Editing datasets](edit-a-data-set.md "edit-a-data-set.md").

The following procedure uses an example table (illustrated in following) to
demonstrate how to prepare your data for Sankey diagrams in Quick Suite. The
table includes three columns: Customer ID, Time, and Action.

| Customer ID | Time     | Action |
| ----------- | -------- | ------ |
| 1           | 9:05 am  | Step 1 |
| 1           | 9:06 am  | Step 2 |
| 1           | 9:08 am  | Step 3 |
| 2           | 11:44 am | Step 1 |
| 2           | 11:47 am | Step 2 |
| 2           | 11:48 am | Step 3 |

To create a Sankey diagram in Quick Suite using this data, first add Source
and Destination columns to the table. Use the following procedure to learn
how.

###### To add Source and Destination columns to your table

1. Add a Step Number column to the table to number or rank each row.

There are multiple ways to compute the Step Number column. If your data
source is compatible with SQL and your database supports
`ROW_NUMBER` or `RANK` functions, you can use
custom SQL in Quick Suite to order the rows in the Step Number column.
For more information about using custom SQL in Quick Suite, see [Using SQL to customize data](adding-a-SQL-query.md "adding-a-SQL-query.md").

| Customer ID | Time     | Action | Step Number |
| ----------- | -------- | ------ | ----------- |
| 1           | 9:05 am  | Step 1 | 1           |
| 1           | 9:06 am  | Step 2 | 2           |
| 1           | 9:08 am  | Step 3 | 3           |
| 2           | 11:44 am | Step 1 | 1           |
| 2           | 11:47 am | Step 2 | 2           |
| 2           | 11:48 am | Step 3 | 3           |

2. Add a Next Row Number column to the table with values equal to Step Number
   plus one.

For example, in the first data row of the table, the value for Step Number
is 1. To compute the value for Next Step Number for that row, add 1 to that
value.

1 + 1 = 2

The value for Step Number in the second data row of the table is 2;
therefore, the value for Next Step Number is 3.

2 + 1 = 3

| Customer ID | Time     | Action | Step Number | Next Step Number |
| ----------- | -------- | ------ | ----------- | ---------------- |
| 1           | 9:05 am  | Step 1 | 1           | 2                |
| 1           | 9:06 am  | Step 2 | 2           | 3                |
| 1           | 9:08 am  | Step 3 | 3           | 4                |
| 2           | 11:44 am | Step 1 | 1           | 2                |
| 2           | 11:47 am | Step 2 | 2           | 3                |
| 2           | 11:48 am | Step 3 | 3           | 4                |

3.  Join the table with itself:
    1.  For **Join type**, choose
        **Inner**.
    2.  For **Join clauses**, do the following:

            1. Choose **Customer ID** =
             **Customer ID**
            2. Choose **Next Step Number** =
             **Step Number**Joining the two tables creates two columns for Customer ID, Time, Action,

        Step Number and Next Step Number. The columns from the table at the left of
        the join are Source columns. The columns from the table at the right of the
        join are Destination columns.

For more information about joining data in Quick Suite, see [Joining data](joining-data.md "joining-data.md"). 4. (Optional) Rename columns to indicate sources and destinations.

The following is an example:

    1. Rename the **Action** column on the left to
     **Source**.
    2. Rename the **Action [copy]** column on the right
     to **Destination**.
    3. Rename the **Time** column on the left to
     **Start Time**.
    4. Rename the **Time [copy]** column on the right to
     **End Time**.

Your data is now ready to visualize.

## Creating Sankey diagrams

Use the following procedure to create a Sankey diagram.

###### To create a Sankey diagram

1. On the analysis screen, choose **Visualize** on the left
   toolbar.
2. On the application bar, choose **Add**, and then choose
   **Add visual**.
3. On the **Visual types** pane, choose the Sankey diagram
   icon.
4. On the menu in the upper-right corner of the visual, choose the
   **Properties** icon.
5. In the **Properties pane**, choose either the
   **Source** or **Destination**
   section.

### Customizing the number of

nodes

Use the following procedure to customize the number of nodes that appear in a
Sankey diagram. Quick Suite supports up to 100 Source/Destination
nodes.

###### To customize the number of nodes that appear in a Sankey diagram

1. On the analysis page, choose the Sankey diagram visual that you want
   to format.
2. On the menu in the upper-right corner of the visual, select the
   **Format Visual** icon.
3. In the **Properties** pane that opens, choose either
   the **Source** or **Destination**
   tab.
4. For **Number of nodes displayed**, enter a
   number.

The nodes in the diagram update to the number that you specified. The
top nodes are automatically shown. All other nodes are placed in an
**Other** category.

###### Note

Specifying the number of Source nodes controls how many Source
nodes can appear overall in the diagram. Specifying the number of
Destination nodes controls how many Destination nodes can appear per
Source node. This means that if there is more than one Source node
in your diagram, the overall number of Destination nodes will be
higher than the number specified.

Quick Suite supports up to 100 Source/Destination
nodes.

For example, the following Sankey diagram has a limit of three source
nodes (out of five), so the top three are shown in the diagram. The
other two source nodes are placed in the Other category.

To remove the **Other** category from the diagram,
select it in the view and choose **Hide “other”
categories**.

## Sankey diagram features
