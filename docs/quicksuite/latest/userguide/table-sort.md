# Sorting tables

In Amazon Quick Suite, you can sort values in a table by fields in the columns headers
of the table or with the **Sort visual** tool. You can sort up to
10 columns in a single table. Quick Suite can also use an off-visual sort You
can sort columns in an **Ascending** or a
**Descending** order. The following image shows the

Quick Suite authors can configure an off-visual sort to sort the values
in a table by a field and aggregation that is a part of the dataset that the
table uses but not in one of the table's field wells. One off-field sort
can be configured to a single table at a time.

Use the procedure below to configure an off-visual sort.

###### To add an off-visual sort to a table

1. Open the [Quick Suite console](https://quicksight.aws.amazon.com/ "https://quicksight.aws.amazon.com/").
2. Open the analysis that you want to work in and navigate to the table
   that you want to sort.
3. Choose the header of any column in the table.
4. For **Sort by**, choose the arrow icon, and then
   choose **Off-visual field**.
5. In the **Off-visual field** pane that appears, open
   the **Sort by** dropdown menu and choose the field that
   you want to sort.
6. For **Aggregation** open the dropdown menu and choose
   the aggregation that you want to use.
7. For **Sort order**, choose if you want the sort to be
   in an ascending or descending order.
8. When you are finished, choose **Apply**.

After a off-visual sort is applied to a table, the sort is shown in the
**Sort visual** menu. The sort order of a table that
contains an off-visual sort depends on the sort configuration of the table when
the off-visual sort is added. If an off-visual sort is added to a table that
already has a single or multi column sort configured, the off-visual sort
overrides all other sorts. If the off-visual sort is applied before single or
multi column sorts, you can add and reorder more sorts to the table.
