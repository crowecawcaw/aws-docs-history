# How RCF is applied to detect

anomalies

A human can easily distinguish a data point that stands out from the rest of the
data. RCF does the same thing by building a "forest" of decision trees,
and then monitoring how new data points change the forest.

An _anomaly_ is a data point that draws your
attention away from normal points—think of an image of a red flower in a
field of yellow flowers. This "displacement of attention" is encoded in
the (expected) position of a tree (that is, a model in RCF) that would be occupied
by the input point. The idea is to create a forest where each decision tree grows
out of a partition of the data sampled for training the algorithm. In more technical
terms, each tree builds a specific type of binary space partitioning tree on the
samples. As Amazon Quick Sight samples the data, RCF assigns each data point an anomaly score.
It gives higher scores to data points that look anomalous. The score is, in
approximation, inversely proportional to the resulting depth of the point in the
tree. The random cut forest assigns an anomaly score by computing the average score
from each constituent tree and scaling the result with respect to the sample size.

The votes or scores of the different models are aggregated because each of the
models by itself is a weak predictor. Amazon Quick Sight identifies a data point as anomalous
when its score is significantly different from the recent points. What qualifies as
an anomaly depends on the application.

The paper [Random Cut
Forest Based Anomaly Detection On Streams](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v48/guha16.pdf "http://proceedings.mlr.press/v48/guha16.pdf") provides multiple examples of
this state-of-the-art online anomaly detection (time-series anomaly detection). RCFs
are used on contiguous segments or “shingles" of data, where the data in the
immediate segment acts as a context for the most recent one. Previous versions of
RCF-based anomaly-detection algorithms score an entire shingle. The algorithm in
Amazon Quick Sight also provides an approximate location of the anomaly in the current extended
context. This approximate location can be useful in the scenario where there is
delay in detecting the anomaly. Delays occur because any algorithm needs to
characterize "previously seen deviations" to "anomalous
deviations," which can unfold over some time.
