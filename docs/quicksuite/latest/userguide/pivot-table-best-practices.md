# Pivot table best practices

It's best to deploy a minimal set of rows, columns, metrics, and table
calculations, rather than offering all possible combinations in one pivot table. If
you include too many, you risk overwhelming the viewer and you can also run into the
computational limitations of the underlying database.

To reduce the level of complexity and reduce the potential for errors, you can
take the following actions:

- Apply filters to reduce the data included in for the visual.
- Use fewer fields in the **Row** and
  **Column** field wells.
- Use as few fields as possible in the **Values** field
  well.
- Create additional pivot tables so that each displays fewer metrics.
  In some cases, there's a business need to examine many metrics in relation to
  each other. In these cases, it can be better to use multiple visuals on the same
  dashboard, each showing a single metric. You can reduce the size of the visuals on
  the dashboard, and colocate them to form a grouping. If a decision the viewer makes
  based on one visual creates the need for a different view, you can deploy custom URL
  actions to launch another dashboard according to the choices made by the
  user.

It's best to think of visuals as building blocks. Rather than using one
visual for multiple purposes, use each visual to facilitate one aspect of a larger
business decision. The viewer should have enough data to make a well-informed
decision, without being overwhelmed by the inclusion of all possibilities.
