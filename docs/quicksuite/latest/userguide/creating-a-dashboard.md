# Publishing dashboards

When you publish an analysis, that analysis becomes a dashboard that can be shared and
interacted with by users of your Amazon Quick Suite account or, in some cases, with anonymous
users that aren't on your account. You can choose to publish one sheet of an
analysis, all sheets in the analysis, or any other combination of sheets that you want.
When you publish an interactive sheet, that sheet becomes an interactive dashboard that
users can interact with. When you publish a pixel perfect report sheet, the sheet becomes a
pixel perfect report that generates and saves a snapshot of the report's data when you
schedule a report in Amazon Quick Sight. You can publish a dashboard that contains any combination
of interactive sheets and pixel perfect reports from the same analysis.

For more information about scheduling a report, see [Scheduling and sending Quick Sight reports by
email](sending-reports.md "sending-reports.md") .

For more information about viewing a report's snapshots, see [Consuming pixel perfect reports in
Amazon Quick Sight](qs-reports-consume-reports.md "qs-reports-consume-reports.md").

Use the following procedure to publish and optionally share a dashboard. You can also
use this procedure to rename a published dashboard. A renamed dashboard retains its
security and emailed report settings.

1. Open the analysis that you want to use. Choose
   **Publish**.
2. Do one of the following:
   - To create a new dashboard, choose **New dashboard**,
     and then type a dashboard name.
   - To replace an existing dashboard, do one of the following. Replacing a
     dashboard updates it without altering security or emailed report
     settings.
     - To update it with your changes, choose **Replace an
       existing dashboard** and then choose a dashboard
       from the list.
     - To rename it, choose **Replace an existing
       dashboard**, choose a dashboard from the list, and
       then select the pencil icon. Enter a new name to rename the
       existing dashboard and click the checkmark or press enter to
       confirm. When you publish a dashboard after renaming, it also
       saves any changes you made to the analysis. Changes to the
       analysis or dashboard are not persisted until you
       **Publish**. An initial version of a
       dashboard must be published in order to rename it.

3. (Optional) Choose the sheets that you want to publish in the
   **SHEETS** dropdown. When you select sheets to add to the
   new dashboard, the dropdown shows how many sheets are selected for publishing.
   The default option is **ALL SHEETS SELECTED**.

If you are replacing an existing dashboard, the sheets that are already
published to the existing dashboard are pre-selected in the dropdown, unless you
are publishing from an analysis you have not previously published from. You can
make changes to this by selecting or de-selecting sheets from the dropdown
list. 4. (Optional) Add comments on the changes you have made in the notes section,
which is available to view under [Version
History](publishing-a-previous-dashboard-version.md "publishing-a-previous-dashboard-version.md"). 5. (Optional) To allow dashboard readers to share data stories, choose
**Allow sharing data stories**. For more information about
data stories, see [Working with data stories in Amazon Quick Sight](working-with-stories.md "working-with-stories.md"). 6. (Optional) Open **More Settings**. These options are only
available if at least one sheet in the new dashboard is an interactive
sheet.

###### Note

This is a scrollable window. Scroll down in the **Publish a
dashboard** window to view all available options.

There are some options that you can turn off to simplify the experience for
this dashboard, as follows:

    * For **Dashboard options**:




    	+ Leave **Expand on-sheet controls by default**
    	 cleared to show a simplified view. This is disabled by default.
    	 To show the controls by default, turn on this option.
    	+ Clear **Enable advanced filtering on the left
    	 pane** to remove the ability for dashboard viewers
    	 to filter the data themselves. If they create their own filters,
    	 the filters exist only while the user is viewing the dashboard.
    	 Filters can't be saved or reused.
    	+ Clear **Enable on-hover tooltip** to turn off
    	 tooltips.
    * For **Visual options**:




    	+ Clear **Enable visual menu**, to turn off the
    	 on-visual menu entirely.
    	+ Clear **Enable download options** if your
    	 dashboard viewers don't need to be able to download data from
    	 the visuals in the dashboard. The CSV file includes only what is
    	 currently visible in the visual at the time they download it.
    	 The viewer downloads data by using the on-visual menu on each
    	 individual visual.
    	+ Clear **Enable maximize visual option** to
    	 turn off the ability to enlarge visuals to fill the
    	 screen.
    * For **Data point options**:




    	+ Clear **Enable drill up/down** if your
    	 dashboard doesn't offer drillable field hierarchies.
    	+ Clear **Enable on-click tooltip** to turn off
    	 tooltips that appear when the reader chooses (clicks on) a data
    	 point.
    	+ Clear **Enable sort options** to turn off
    	 sorting controls.

7. Choose **Publish dashboard**.

If you renamed the existing dashboard, the top of the screen refreshes to show
the new name. 8. (Optional) Do one of the following:

    * To publish a dashboard without sharing, choose **x**
     at the upper right of the **Share dashboard with
     users** screen when it appears. You can always share the
     dashboard later by choosing **File>Share** from the
     application bar.
    * To share the dashboard, follow the procedure in [Sharing Amazon Quick Sight dashboards](sharing-a-dashboard.md "sharing-a-dashboard.md").

After you complete these steps, you complete creating and sharing the
dashboard. Subscribers of the dashboard receive email that contains a link to
the dashboard. Groups don't receive invitation emails.
