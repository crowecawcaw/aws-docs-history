# Range and scale on visual types in

Quick Suite

To change the scale of the values shown on the visual, you can use the
**Properties** pane to set the range for one or both axes of the
visual. This option is available for the value axes on bar charts, combo charts, line
charts, and scatter plots.

By default, the axis range starts at 0 and ends with the highest value for the measure
being displayed. For the group-by axis, you can use the data zoom tool on the visual to
dynamically adjust the scale.

###### To set the axis range for a visual

1.  On the analysis page, choose the visual that you want to format.
2.  Choose the control menu at the upper-right corner of the visual, and then
    choose the cog icon.
3.  On the **Properties** pane, choose
    **X-Axis** or **Y-Axis**, depending on
    what type of visual you are customizing. This is the **X-Axis**
    section for horizontal bar charts, the **Y-Axis** section for
    vertical bar charts and line charts, and both axes are available for scatter
    plots. On combo charts, use **Bars** and
    **Lines** instead.
4.  Enter a new name in the box to rename the axis. To revert to the default name,
    delete your entry.
5.  Set the range for the axis by choosing one of the following options:
    - Choose **Auto (starting at 0)** to have the range
      start at 0 and end around the highest value for the measure being
      displayed.
    - Choose **Auto (based on data range)** to have the
      range start at the lowest value for the measure being displayed and end
      around the highest value for the measure being displayed.
    - Choose **Custom** to have the range start and end at
      values that you specify.

    If you choose **Custom**, enter the start and end
    values in the fields in that section. Typically, you use integers for
    the range values. For stacked 100 percent bar charts, use a decimal
    value to indicate the percentage that you want. For example, if you want
    the range to be 0–30 percent instead of 0–100 percent,
    enter 0 for the start value and .3 for the end value.

6.  For **Scale**, the default is linear scale. To show
    logarithmic scale, also called log scale, enable the logarithmic option.
    Quick Suite chooses the axis labels to display based on the range of
    values in that axis.
    - On a linear scale, the axis labels are evenly spaced to show the
      arithmetical difference between them. The labels display the numbers in
      sets like {1000, 2000, 3000…} or {0, 50 million, 100 million…}, but not
      {10 thousand, 1 million, 1 billion…}.

    Use a _linear scale_ for the
    following cases:

        + All the numbers that display on the chart are in the same
         order of magnitude.
        + You want the axis labels to be evenly spaced.
        + The axis values have a similar number of digits, for example
         100, 200, 300, and so on.
        + The rate of change between numbers is relatively slow and
         steady—in other words, your trend line never approaches
         becoming vertical.

    Examples:

        + Profits in different regions of the same country
        + Costs incurred for manufacture of an item

    - On a _logarithmic scale_, the axis
      values are spaced to show the orders of magnitude as a way of comparing
      them. The log scale is often used to display very large ranges of values
      or percentages, or to show exponential growth.

    Use logarithmic scale for the following cases:

        + The numbers that display on the chart aren’t in the same order
         of magnitude.
        + You want the axis labels to be flexibly spaced to reflect the
         wide range of values in that axis. This might mean that the axis
         values have a different number of digits, for example 10, 100,
         1000, and so on. It might also mean that the axis labels are
         unevenly spaced.
        + The rate of change between numbers is growing exponentially or
         is too large to display in a meaningful way.
        + The customer of your chart understands how to interpret data
         on a log scale.
        + The chart displays values that growing faster and faster.
         Moving given distance on the scale means the number has been
         multiplied by another number.

    Examples:

        + High yield stock prices over a long range of time
        + Growth of pandemic infection rates

7.  To customize the number of values to show on the axis labels, enter in an
    integer between 1 and 50.
8.  For combo charts, choose **Single Y Axis** to synchronize the
    Y-axes for both bars and lines into a single axis.
9.  Close the **Properties** pane by choosing the
    **X** icon in the upper-right corner of the pane.
