# Build predictive models with SageMaker AI

Canvas

Amazon Quick Suite authors can export data into SageMaker AI Canvas to build ML models that can be
sent back to Quick Suite. Authors can use these ML models to augment their
datasets with predictive analytics that can be used to build analyses and
dashboards.

**Prerequisites**

- A Quick Suite account that's integrated with IAM Identity Center. If your
  Quick Suite account isn't integrated with IAM Identity Center, create a new
  Quick Suite account and choose **Use IAM Identity Center enabled
  application** as the identity provider.
  - For more information on IAM Identity Center, see [Getting
    started](../../../singlesignon/latest/userguide/getting-started.md "../../../singlesignon/latest/userguide/getting-started.md").
  - To learn more about integrating your Quick Suite with IAM Identity Center, see
    [Configure your Amazon Quick Suite
    account with IAM Identity Center](setting-up-sso.md#sec-identity-management-identity-center "setting-up-sso.md#sec-identity-management-identity-center").
  - To import assets from an existing Quick Suite account to a new
    Quick Suite account that's integrated with IAM Identity Center, see [Asset
    bundle operations](../../../quicksight/latest/developerguide/asset-bundle-ops.md "../../../quicksight/latest/developerguide/asset-bundle-ops.md").

- A new SageMaker AI domain that is integrated with IAM Identity Center. For more information about
  onboarding to SageMaker AI Domain with IAM Identity Center, see [Onboard to SageMaker AI Domain
  using IAM Identity Center](../../../sagemaker/latest/dg/onboard-sso-users.md "../../../sagemaker/latest/dg/onboard-sso-users.md").

## Build a predictive model

in SageMaker AI Canvas from Amazon Quick Sight

###### To build a predictive model in SageMaker AI Canvas

1. Log in to Amazon Quick Suite and navigate to the tabular table or pivot table
   that you want to create a predictive model for.
2. Open the on-visual menu and choose **Build a predictive
   model**.
3. In the **Build a predictive model in SageMaker AI Canvas** pop up
   that appears, review the information presented and then choose
   **EXPORT DATA TO SAGEMAKER CANVAS**.
4. In the **Exports** pane that appears, choose **GO
   TO SAGEMAKER CANVAS** when the export is completed to go to the
   SageMaker AI Canvas console.
5. In SageMaker AI Canvas, create a predictive model with the data that you exported
   from Quick Sight. You can choose to follow a guided tour that helps you
   create the predictive model, or you can skip the tour and work at your own
   pace. For more information about creating a predictive model in SageMaker AI Canvas,
   see [Build a model](../../../sagemaker/latest/dg/canvas-build-model-how-to.md#canvas-build-model-numeric-categorical "../../../sagemaker/latest/dg/canvas-build-model-how-to.md#canvas-build-model-numeric-categorical").
6. Send the predictive model back to Quick Sight. For more information about
   sending a model from SageMaker AI Canvas to Amazon Quick Sight, see [Send your
   model to Amazon Quick Sight](../../../sagemaker/latest/dg/canvas-send-model-to-quicksight.md "../../../sagemaker/latest/dg/canvas-send-model-to-quicksight.md").

## Create a dataset with

a SageMaker AI Canvas model

After you create a predictive model in SageMaker AI Canvas and send it back to
Quick Sight, use the new model to create a new dataset or apply it to an existing
dataset.

###### To add a predictive field to a dataset

1. Open the Quick Suite console, choose **Data** at
   left, and choose the **Datasets** tab.
2. Upload a new dataset or choose an existing dataset.
3. Choose **Edit**.
4. On the dataset' data prep page, choose **ADD**, and
   then choose **Add predictive field** to open the
   **Augment with SageMaker AI** modal.
5. For **Model**, choose the model that you sent to
   Quick Sight from SageMaker AI Canvas. The schema file automatically populates in
   the **Advanced settings** pane. Review the inputs, and then
   choose **Next**.
6. On the **Review outputs** pane, enter a field name and
   description for a colum to be targeted by the model that you created in SageMaker AI
   Canvas.
7. When you are finished, choose **Prepare data**.
8. After you choose **Prepare data**, you are redirected to
   the dataset page. To publish the new dataset, choose, **Publish
   & Visuallize**.

When you publish a new dataset that uses a model from SageMaker AI Canvas, the data is
imported into SPICE and a batch inference job begins in SageMaker AI. It can take up to 10
minutes for these processes to complete.

## Considerations

The following limitations apply to the creation of SageMaker AI Canvas models with
Quick Sight data.

- The **Build a predictive model** option that is used to
  send data to SageMaker AI Canvas is only available on table and tabular pivot table
  visuals. The table or pivot table visual must have between 2 and 1,000
  fields and at least 500 rows.
- Datasets that contain integer or geographic data types will experience
  schema mapping errors when you add a predictive field to the dataset. To
  resolve this issue, remove the integer or geographic data types from the
  dataset or convert them to a new data type.
