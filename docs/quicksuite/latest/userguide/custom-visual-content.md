# Using custom visual content

You can embed webpages and online videos, forms, and images in your Quick Suite
dashboards using the custom visual content chart type.

For example, you can embed the image of your company logo in your dashboards. You can
also embed an online video from your organization's latest conference, or embed an
online form asking readers of the dashboard if the dashboard is helpful.

After you create custom visual content, you can use navigation actions to navigate
within them. You can also use parameters to control what appears in them.

The following limitations apply to custom visual content:

- Only `https` URL schemes are supported.
- Custom visual content isn't supported in email reports.
- Images and websites that use hotlink protection won't load in custom
  visuals.
  To embed a webpage, video, online form, or image in your dashboard, choose the custom
  visual content icon in the **Visual types** pane.

For more information about adding visuals to a dashboard, see [Adding a visual](creating-a-visual.md#create-a-visual "creating-a-visual.md#create-a-visual").

Use the following procedures to learn how to embed custom visuals in your
dashboards.

## Best practices for using

custom visual content

When embedding web content using the custom visual content chart type, we
recommend the following:

- Choose web content from sources that support viewing or opening the
  content in an IFrame. If the source of the web content doesn't support being
  viewed or opened in an IFrame, the content doesn't appear in
  Quick Suite, even if the URL is accurate.
- When possible, use embeddable URLs, especially for videos, online forms,
  spreadsheets, and documents. Embeddable URLs create a better experience for
  readers of your dashboard and make interacting with the content easier. You
  can usually find the embeddable URL for content when you choose to share the
  content from the source website.
- To embed internal URLs or URLs that you own, you might need to set them to
  be opened in an IFrame.
- When viewing custom visual content in an analysis or dashboard, make sure
  you enable all cookies. If third-party cookies are blocked in your browser,
  images that are part of the website that is embedded within the custom
  content visual do not render.

###### Note

Chrome has announced plans to deprecate all third-party cookies by the
end of 2024. This means that websites that are embedded within
Quick Suite custom content visuals will no longer show any
contents that rely on third-party cookies in Chrome. For more
information about Chrome's plans to deprecate third party cookies,
see [Chrome is deprecating third-party cookies](https://cloud.google.com/looker/docs/best-practices/chrome-third-party-cookie-deprecation "https://cloud.google.com/looker/docs/best-practices/chrome-third-party-cookie-deprecation").

## Embedding images in a

dashboard

You can embed an online image in a dashboard using the image URL. Use the
following procedure to embed an image using the custom visual content chart
type.

Embedded images don't appear in a browser that has third-party cookies blocked. To
see embedded images in a dashboard, enable third-party cookies in your browser
settings.

###### To embed an image in a dashboard

1. In the **Visual types** pane, choose the custom visual
   content icon.
2. In the visual, choose **Customize visual**.
3. In the **Properties** pane that opens, under
   **Custom content**, enter the image URL for the image
   that you want to embed.
4. Choose **Apply**.

The image appears as a webpage in the visual. 5. Choose **Show as image**.

If the URL is an image, the image appears in the visual.

If the URL is not an image, such as a URL to a slide show, gallery, or
webpage, the following message appears: `This URL doesn't appear to be
 an image. Update the URL to an image`. To do so, open the image
that you want to embed in a separate browser tab, or choose an embeddable
URL for the image (usually found when you choose to share the image). 6. (Optional) For **Image sizing options**, choose one of
the following options:

    * **Fit to width** – This option fits the
     image to the width of the visual.
    * **Fit to height** – This option fits the
     image to the height of the visual.
    * **Scale to visual** – This option scales
     the image to the width and height of the visual. This option might
     contort the image.
    * **Do not scale** – This option keeps the
     image at its original scale and doesn't fit the image to the
     dimensions of the visual. With this option, the image is centered in
     the visual and the parts of the image that are within the width and
     height of the visual appear. Some parts of the image might not
     appear if the visual is smaller than the image. If the visual is
     larger than the image, however, the image is centered in the visual
     and is surrounded by white space.

## Embedding online forms in a

dashboard

You can embed an online form in a dashboard using the embeddable URL. Use the
following procedure to embed an online form using the custom visual content chart

   content icon.

   form that you want to embed.

If possible, use an embeddable URL for the form. Using an embeddable URL
creates a better experience for readers of your dashboard who might want to
interact with the form. You can often find the embeddable URL when you
choose to share the form on the site where you create it. 4. Choose **Apply**.

The form appears in the visual.

 For a Vimeo video, the following is an example of an embed URL:
 `https://player.vimeo.com/video/`uniqueid``. 4. Choose **Apply**.
