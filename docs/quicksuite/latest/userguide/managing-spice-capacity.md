# Configure SPICE memory

capacity

_SPICE (Super-fast, Parallel, In-memory Calculation
Engine)_ is the robust in-memory engine that Amazon Quick Suite uses.
It's engineered to rapidly perform advanced calculations and serve data. In Enterprise
edition, data stored in SPICE is encrypted at rest. For more information, see
[Data
encryption in Quick Suite](../../../quicksight/latest/user/data-encryption.md "../../../quicksight/latest/user/data-encryption.md").

SPICE capacity is allocated separately per AWS Region. For each
AWS account, SPICE capacity is shared by all the people using
Quick Suite in a single AWS Region. The other AWS Regions have no
SPICE capacity unless you choose to purchase some.

Quick Suite administrators can view how much [SPICE](../../../quicksight/latest/user/spice.md "../../../quicksight/latest/user/spice.md") capacity you
have in each AWS Region and how much of it is currently in use. Administrators can also
purchase additional SPICE capacity or release unused SPICE
capacity. You can only release SPICE capacity that isn't currently used by a
dataset. Datasets in SPICE stay there until someone remove them from
SPICE. To change that, you can either delete the datasets or change them
so they aren't stored in SPICE.

Purchasing or releasing SPICE capacity only affects the capacity for the
currently selected AWS Region. Each AWS account can have a separate Amazon Quick Suite
subscription and can be used in multiple
AWS Regions.

Before you make any changes to SPICE capacity, make sure that you're
using the correct AWS account and AWS Region. It's possible to be using different
AWS accounts or AWS Regions at the same time in different contexts, as follows:

- If you open Amazon Quick Suite using the `http://quicksight.aws.amazon.com`
  URL, Amazon Quick Suite automatically selects your account and AWS Region. You
  can't view your AWS account from Amazon Quick Suite. We recommend using a different
  method to open Amazon Quick Suite when you want to work with SPICE
  capacity.
- If you open Amazon Quick Suite from the AWS Management Console, Amazon Quick Suite opens in the account
  that you used to sign in to that console. However, it opens in the last AWS Region
  that you selected in Amazon Quick Suite. The AWS Management Console and the Amazon Quick Suite console each
  have an AWS Region selector that works independently from the other. Changing the
  selected AWS Region in the AWS console doesn't change the AWS Region in
  Amazon Quick Suite.
- If you use the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) to run Amazon Quick Suite commands, make sure to
  provide the relevant AWS account for each Amazon Quick Suite API operation you use. The
  AWS Region isn't always required, and if you don't provide it, the AWS CLI uses
  your default AWS Region from your AWS configuration. We recommend that you
  always explicitly provide the AWS Region, to make sure you apply the command to
  the correct AWS Region.
  You must be signed in as a Amazon Quick Suite administrator to view or manage
  SPICE capacity.

## Finding your current AWS

account and AWS Region

###### To select the correct AWS account and AWS Region (console)

1. Open the AWS console, using the AWS account that you want to view
   SPICE information for. If you have only one AWS account,
   you can skip this step.

You can verify the account number by following these steps:

    1. On the navigation bar at the top of the page, choose the account name
     or number at right. If a number displays, this might be your
     AWS account ID.
    2. Choose **My Security Credentials** to display your
     credential-related information and options. Your AWS account ID
     displays near the top of the page.To return to the original page, choose the AWS logo at upper left.

2. Open Amazon Quick Suite by first entering "`quicksight`" into
   the **Find Services** search box. When the word Amazon Quick Suite
   appears following the search box, choose it from the list.
3. In Amazon Quick Suite, open the profile menu by choosing your profile icon at top
   right. The AWS name of the AWS Region that Amazon Quick Suite is using displays in
   the menu.

The same AWS Region also displays in the URL, for example:
`https://`us-east-1`.quicksight.aws.amazon.com/sn/admin`.
If this is your URL, the profile menu displays the name N. Virginia.

To switch AWS Regions, display the list of supported Regions by choosing the
Region name from the profile menu. Then choose the Region that you want to use.
Switching to a different AWS Region changes the SPICE usage
information that you can view. It also changes the Amazon Quick Suite assets that you
can use, for example data sources and dashboards.

## Viewing SPICE capacity

and usage in an AWS Region

###### To view current SPICE capacity and usage (console)

1.  Open Amazon Quick Suite. Make sure that you're using the correct AWS account
    and AWS Region as described previously in [Finding your current AWS account and AWS
    Region](../../../quicksight/latest/user/current-aws-account-and-default-aws-region.md "../../../quicksight/latest/user/current-aws-account-and-default-aws-region.md").
2.  Open the administration page by choosing **Manage
    Quick Suite** from your profile menu.
3.  Choose **SPICE capacity** from the left
    navigation pane . The following information displays:
    - The **Total SPICE capacity** section
      displays the total amount of used and unused SPICE
      capacity. A bar graph shows how much of this storage space is in each of
      the following categories for this AWS account in the AWS Region
      that's currently selected in Amazon Quick Suite:

          + Purchased SPICE capacity – This is the
           additional SPICE capacity.
          + SPICE capacity bundled with Amazon Quick Suite
           – This is the total default capacity associated with your
           paid users.

      Hover over any section of the meter to see details on that capacity
      type.

    - The **SPICE usage** section displays
      the total amount of the used and unused SPICE capacity. A
      bar graph shows how much of this storage space is in each of the
      following categories for this AWS account in the AWS Region that's
      currently selected in Amazon Quick Suite:
      - Used SPICE capacity – This is the used
        portion of the default SPICE capacity that you
        get for each user.
      - Unused SPICE capacity – This is the
        unused portion of the default SPICE capacity that
        you get for each user.
      - Releasable unused capacity – This is the purchased
        capacity that isn't in use, and so can be released to reduce
        costs.

## Hiding SPICE capacity

labels

Amazon Quick Suite account admins can choose to hide the account-wide SPICE
capacity usage and remaining size labels from Amazon Quick Suite authors. This feature is
available to all enterprise accounts that use custom permissions. For more information
about custom permissions in Amazon Quick Suite, see [Customizing access to Amazon Quick Suite capabilities](../../../quicksight/latest/user/customizing-permissions-to-the-quicksight-console.md "../../../quicksight/latest/user/customizing-permissions-to-the-quicksight-console.md")

Use the following procedure to hide SPICE capacity usage from the
Amazon Quick Suite console.

1. Open the [Quick Suite console](https://quicksight.aws.amazon.com/ "https://quicksight.aws.amazon.com/").
2. From any page in the Amazon Quick Suite console, choose your profile name, and then
   choose **Manage Quick Suite**.

The **Manage Quick Suite** menu is only available to
Amazon Quick Suite admins. If you are unable to acces this menu, contact your
Amazon Quick Suite account admin for assistance. 3. Choose **Manage users**, and then choose **Manage
permissions**. 4. Edit or create a new custom permission. For **Restrict access
to**, under **Datasets**, select **Viewing
account SPICE capacity**. 5. When you are finished creating or changing the custom permission, chose
**Create** or **Update**.

After you create or update a custom permission to hide SPICE capacity
usage, assign the new permission to users with the `UpdateUser` API.

## Purchasing SPICE capacity in

an AWS Region

###### To purchase more SPICE capacity (console)

1. Open Amazon Quick Suite. Make sure that you're using the correct AWS account
   and AWS Region as described previously in [Finding your current AWS account and AWS
   Region](../../../quicksight/latest/user/current-aws-account-and-default-aws-region.md "../../../quicksight/latest/user/current-aws-account-and-default-aws-region.md").
2. Open the administration page by choosing **Manage
   Quick Suite** from your profile menu.
3. Choose **SPICE capacity** from the left
   navigation pane .
4. Choose the **Purchase more capacity** button.
5. Enter a number of gigabytes of SPICE capacity to purchase for
   the AWS Region that is currently selected in Amazon Quick Suite.
6. To confirm your choice, choose **Purchase SPICE
   capacity**. To exit without making any changes, choose
   **Cancel**.

## Turning on SPICE auto capacity

purchasing

Turn on SPICE auto capacity purchasing to allow Amazon Quick Suite to
automatically manage your Amazon Quick Suite account's SPICE capacity.
When you turn auto capacity purchasing on, Amazon Quick Suite evaluates how much capacity is
needed based on your account's usage. As your account uses more
SPICE storage, Amazon Quick Suite automatically purchases
SPICE capacity as needed on your behalf. This allows users to ingest
data as needed without the need to estimate usage or manually purchase
SPICE data. Auto capacity purchasing makes it easier for new
customers, ISVs, and larger companies to directly access SPICE without
needing to understand, track, or manually purchase their account's
SPICE capacity. Amazon Quick Suite admins can still purchase and release
SPICE capacity manually.

Auto capacity purchasing doesn't support auto-decrement. If users want to reduce
their SPICE usage, capacity release must be done manually.

By default, all new Amazon Quick Suite accounts that are created in the Amazon Quick Suite console
have auto capacity purchasing turned on in the region that their capacity is located. To
turn on auto capacity purchasing for other regions, Amazon Quick Suite account admins can
manually turn on auto capacity from the **SPICE capacity** management
page.

By default, all new Amazon Quick Suite accounts that were created with the Amazon Quick Suite API
and all existing Amazon Quick Suite accounts have auto capacity purchasing turned off. To turn
on auto capacity purchasing, Amazon Quick Suite account admins can manually turn on auto
capacity from the **SPICE capacity** management page.

###### To turn SPICE capacity purchasing on or off

1. Open the [Quick Suite console](https://quicksight.aws.amazon.com/ "https://quicksight.aws.amazon.com/").
2. From any page in the Amazon Quick Suite console, choose your profile name, and then
   choose **Manage Quick Suite**.

The **Manage Quick Suite** menu is only available to
Amazon Quick Suite admins. If you are unable to acces this menu, contact your
Amazon Quick Suite account admin for assistance. 3. Choose **SPICE capacity**. 4. On the **SPICE Capacity** page that opens,
toggle the **Auto-purchase capacity** on.

To turn auto capacity purchasing off, follow the procedure above and toggle
**Auto-purchase capacity** off. When auto purchase capacity is
turned off, ingestions or refreshes that exceed the account's SPICE
capacity automatically fail.

Amazon Quick Suite admins can turn auto capacity pricing on or off at any time. If you turn
auto capacity purchasing off after it's been in use, your account's current
capacity becomes your account's purchased capacity. If your account has no
remaining capacity when you turn auto purchase off, the next ingestion or refresh will
fail.

If your account already exceeds its SPICE capacity when you turn auto
capacity purchasing on, Amazon Quick Suite automatically matches your account's capacity
to your current usage. After Amazon Quick Suite matches your account's capacity, the
auto-purchase logic starts.

## Releasing SPICE capacity in an

AWS Region

###### To release unused SPICE capacity (console)

1. Open Amazon Quick Suite. Make sure that you're using the correct AWS account
   and AWS Region as described previously in [Finding your current AWS account and AWS
   Region](../../../quicksight/latest/user/current-aws-account-and-default-aws-region.md "../../../quicksight/latest/user/current-aws-account-and-default-aws-region.md").
2. Open the administration page by choosing **Manage
   Quick Suite** from your profile menu.
3. Choose **SPICE capacity** from the left
   navigation pane .
4. Choose **Release unused purchased capacity**.
5. Do one of the following:
   - To release all SPICE capacity from the AWS Region
     that is currently selected in Amazon Quick Suite, choose **Release
     all**.
   - To release some of gigabytes of SPICE capacity from the
     AWS Region that is currently selected in Amazon Quick Suite, enter the
     number of gigabytes to release.

6. To confirm your choice, choose **Release SPICE
   capacity**. To exit without making any changes, choose
   **Cancel**.
