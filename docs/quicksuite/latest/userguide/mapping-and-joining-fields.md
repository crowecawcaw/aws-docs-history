# Mapping and joining fields

When you are using different datasets together in Quick Sight, you can simplify the
process of mapping fields or joining tables during the data preparation stage. You
should already be verifying that your fields have the correct data type and an
appropriate field name. However, if you already know which datasets are going to be used
together, you can take a couple of extra steps to make your work easier later on.

## Mapping fields

Quick Sight can automatically map fields between datasets in the same analysis.
The following tips can help make it easier for Quick Sight to automatically map
fields between datasets, for example if you are creating a filter action across
datasets:

- Matching field names – Field names must match exactly, with no
  differences in case, spacing, or punctuation. You can rename fields that
  describe the same data, so an automatic mapping is accurate.
- Matching data types – Fields must have the same data type for
  automatic mapping. You can change the data types while you are preparing the
  data. This step also gives you the opportunity to discover whether you need
  to filter out any data that isn't the correct data type.
- Using calculated fields – You can use calculated fields to create a
  matching field, and give it the correct name and data type for automatic
  mapping.

###### Note

After an automatic mapping exists, you can rename a field without breaking the
field mapping. However, if you change the data type, the mapping is
broken.

For more information on field mapping for filter actions across datasets, see
[Creating and editing custom actions in
Amazon Quick Sight](custom-actions.md "custom-actions.md").

## Joining fields

You can create joins between data from different data sources, including files or
databases. The following tips can help make it easier for you to join data from
different files or data sources:

- Similar field names – It is simpler to join fields when you can see
  what should match; for example, **Order ID** and
  **order-id** seem as if they should be the same. But if
  one is a work order, and the other is a purchase order, then the fields are
  probably different data. If possible, make sure that the files and tables
  that you want to join have field names making it clear what data they
  contain.
- Matching data types – Fields must have the same data type before
  you can join on them. Make sure that the files and tables that you want to
  join having matching data types in join fields. You can't use a calculated
  field for a join. Also, you can't join two existing datasets. You create the
  joined dataset by directly accessing the source data.
