# Split

`split` splits a string into an array of substrings, based on a
delimiter that you choose, and returns the item specified by the position.

You can only add `split` to a calculated field during data preparation,
not to an analysis. This function is not supported in direct queries to Microsoft
SQL Server.

## Syntax

```
split(`expression`, `delimiter` , `position`)
```

## Arguments

_expression_

The expression must be a string. It can be the name of a field
that uses the string data type, a literal value like `'12
 Main Street;1402 35th Ave;1818 Elm Ct;11 Janes
 Lane'`, or a call to another function that outputs a
string.

_delimiter_

The character that delimits where the string is broken into
substrings. For example, `split('one|two|three', '|', 2)`
becomes the following.

```
one
two
three
```

If you choose `position = 2`, `split`
returns `'two'`.

_position_

(Required) The position of the item to return from the array. The
position of the first item in the array is 1.

## Return type

String array

## Example

The following example splits a string into an array, using the semicolon
character (;) as the delimiter, and returns the third element of the
array.

```
split('123 Test St;1402 35th Ave;1818 Elm Ct;11 Janes Lane', ';', 3)
```

The following item is returned.

```
1818 Elm Ct
```

This function skips items containing null values or empty strings.
