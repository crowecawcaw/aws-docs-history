# ML-powered forecasting

The ML-powered forecast computation forecasts future metrics based on patterns
of previous metrics by seasonality. For example, you can create a computation to
forecast total revenue for the next six months.

To use this function, you need at least one dimension in the
**Time** field well.

For more information about working with forecasts, see [Forecasting and creating what-if scenarios with
Amazon Quick Sight](forecasts-and-whatifs.md "forecasts-and-whatifs.md").

## Parameters

_name_

A unique descriptive name that you assign or change. A name is
assigned if you don't create your own. You can edit this
later.

_Date_

The date dimension that you want to rank.

_Value_

The aggregated measure that the computation is based
on.

_Periods forward_

The number of time periods in the future that you want to
forecast. Ranges from 1 to 1,000.

_Periods backward_

The number of time periods in the past that you want to base
your forecast on. Ranges from 0 to 1,000.

_Seasonality_

The number of seasons included in the calendar year. The
default setting, **automatic** detects this for
you. Ranges from 1 to 180.

## Computation outputs

Each function generates a set of output parameters. You can add these
outputs to the autonarrative to customize what it displays. You can also add
your own custom text.

To locate the output parameters, open the
**Computations** tab on the right, and locate the
computation that you want to use. The names of the computations come from
the name you provide when you create the insight. Choose the output
parameter by clicking on it only once. If you click twice, you add the same
output twice. Items displayed in **bold** can
be used in the narrative.

- `timeField` – From the **Time**
  field well.
  - `**name**`
    – The formatted display name of the field.
  - `**timeGranularity**` – The time
    field granularity (**DAY**,
    **YEAR**, and so on).

- `metricField` – From the
  **Values** field well.
  - `**name**`
    – The formatted display name of the field.
  - `**aggregationFunction**` – The
    aggregation used for the metric (**SUM**,
    **AVG**, and so on).

- `metricValue` – The value in the metric
  dimension.
  - `**value**`
    – The raw value.
  - `**formattedValue**` – The value
    formatted by the metric field.
  - `**formattedAbsoluteValue**` –
    The absolute value formatted by the metric field.

- `timeValue` – The value in the date
  dimension.
  - `**value**`
    – The raw value.
  - `**formattedValue**` – The value
    formatted by the date field.

- `**relativePeriodsToForecast**` – The
  relative number of periods between latest datetime record and last
  forecast record.
