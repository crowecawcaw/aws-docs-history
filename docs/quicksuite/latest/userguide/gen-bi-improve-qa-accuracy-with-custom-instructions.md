# Improve Q&A

accuracy with custom instructions

Custom Instructions enables Authors to curate Amazon Q's responses to questions by adding
domain-specific knowledge that can’t be captured through a topic’s metadata settings,
such as synonyms or semantic types. By providing these metadata descriptions or custom
instructions, Authors can guide Amazon Q to align its responses with distinct definitions,
preferences, and expert knowledge—ensuring more accurate, relevant, and tailored answers
that are better suited for their business needs.

Use the following table to understand when and how to apply different types of
metadata to improve Q&A answer accuracy. Each metadata type plays a unique role in
clarifying context, resolving ambiguity, and ensuring that answers are aligned with
business rules or domain-specific terminology.

| Metadata Type                   | When to Use                                                                                                                                                                       | How it Improves Answer Accuracy                                                                                                                         |
| ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Field-Level Description         | When the Q&A system needs to understand ambiguous or<br>domain-specific column names (for example, `DTC<br>Spend`).                                                               | Clarifies field semantics so the model can answer more precisely<br>(for example, interpreting `DTC Spend` as<br>Direct-to-Consumer marketing expense). |
| Topic-Level Description         | When users may ask broad or ambiguous questions and Amazon Q needs more<br>context about the topic's overall purpose (for example, sales<br>performance vs. clinical trial data). | Helps disambiguate general terms and steer answers toward the<br>right domain (for example, sales vs. marketing).                                       |
| Dataset Description             | When users have access to multiple datasets and the Q&A system<br>needs to identify which one best fits the question.                                                             | Enables dataset selection logic by providing context about each<br>dataset's purpose and content.                                                       |
| Topic-Level Custom Instructions | When a topic has specific business rules, timeframes, or<br>definitions (for example, fiscal year ≢ calendar<br>year).                                                            | Applies custom logic or definitions (for example, defining Q1 as<br>August-October) to tailor answers appropriately.                                    |

## Adding field-level descriptions

###### To add field-level descriptions:

1. Open the [Quick Suite console](https://quicksight.aws.amazon.com/ "https://quicksight.aws.amazon.com/").
2. Choose **Topics** and then open the topic you want to add
   descriptions for.
3. From the topic details page, select the **Data** tab then
   choose the **Data Fields** sub-tab.
4. Add a description to improve answer accuracy for each included field. This
   is especially important for field names that contain bespoke corporate
   knowledge to understand.

If you have multiple date fields, for example, clear descriptions can help Amazon Q
distinguish between them and choose the most relevant one based on the user’s
question. In the sample below, an Author added descriptions for **Solution
Create** and **Topic Create**, which enables Amazon Q to
more accurately select the appropriate date field in context.

## Adding topic-level

descriptions

###### To add topic-level descriptions:

1. Open the [Quick Suite console](https://quicksight.aws.amazon.com/ "https://quicksight.aws.amazon.com/").
2. Choose **Topics** and then open the topic you want to add
   descriptions for.
3. From the topic details page, select the **Summary**
   tab.
4. Under **Topic Details**, add a description to provide
   more context about the topic's overall purpose.

## Adding dataset descriptions

###### To add dataset descriptions:

1. Open the [Quick Suite console](https://quicksight.aws.amazon.com/ "https://quicksight.aws.amazon.com/").
2. Choose **Topics** and then open the topic you want to add
   descriptions for.
3. From the topic details page, select the **Data** tab then
   choose the **Datasets** sub-tab.
4. Add a description to help improve dataset selection logic.

## Adding topic-level custom

instructions

###### To add custom instructions:

1. Open the [Quick Suite console](https://quicksight.aws.amazon.com/ "https://quicksight.aws.amazon.com/").
2. Choose **Topics** and then open the topic you want to add
   descriptions for.
3. From the topics details page, select the **Custom
   Instructions** tab.
4. Add topic-level guidance to help the chat better understand the context,
   terminology, or intent that is specific to the selected topic. This can
   include disambiguation tips, field relationships, definitions for terms that
   can’t be captured in a calculated field or topic filter, or instructions for
   customizing relative date ranges.

## Best practices for

writing custom instructions

**Match cell values precisely**

- Use the exact cell value from the database, including casing and
  formatting.
- If the value is ambiguous, reference its source column to clarify.

Examples:

- Instead of: "_AMZ are Amazon customers_"

Use: "_AMZ are 'Amazon.com, Inc.' customers_"

- Instead of: "_ETPs are enterprise customers_"

Use: "_ETPs are customers from the enterprise
Segment_"

**Be specific and quantitative**

Avoid vague language—be clear about filters, thresholds, and source
columns.

Example:

- Instead of: "_Filter large customers when talking about
  sales_"

Use: "_Filter customers where Annual Revenue > $1M when talking
about sales_"

**Use formatting for clarity, not function**

Spacing and line breaks do not affect model behavior, but help authors read and
maintain instructions more easily.

**Understand what custom instructions cannot do**

Custom instructions improve the understanding of your business context, but they
do not add new capabilities. These instructions will not:

- Change chart type selections
- Perform calculations or fill nulls
- Create new fields
- Control formatting, colors, or legends
- Alter the narrative or number/type of visuals

## Adding

field-level descriptions in data preparation for dashboard-based Q&A

In addition to Topic-based descriptions, you can create field-level definitions to
enhance [Dashboard Q&A](dashboard-qa.md "dashboard-qa.md") functionality. Adding
specific definitions to individual fields during the data preparation phase improves
the answer accuracy when users ask questions about particular dashboard
elements.

###### To add field-level descriptions for dashboard-based Q&A:

1. Open the [Quick Suite console](https://quicksight.aws.amazon.com/ "https://quicksight.aws.amazon.com/").
2. Choose **Data**, open a dataset that you have access to,
   and select **EDIT DATASET**.
3. For each relevant field, choose the three-dot menu and select
   **Edit name & description**.
4. Add a description to enhance answers for dashboard-related
   questions.
5. Choose **Apply** to save your changes.
