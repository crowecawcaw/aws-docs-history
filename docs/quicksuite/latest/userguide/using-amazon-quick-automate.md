# Using Amazon Quick Automate

## Overview

Amazon Quick Automate is an AI-powered application that creates sophisticated automations using natural language or documentation. Amazon Quick Automate revolutionizes enterprise workflow by transforming complex processes into intelligent, adaptive automations.

Enterprises struggle to automate end-to-end business processes due to the growing complexity of their application ecosystems and the limitations of traditional automation tools. Amazon Quick Automate provides the easiest way for businesses to build, deploy, and continuously maintain workflow automations with the set of capabilities needed to support complex use cases that span multiple applications, data sources, and departments.

Customers can simply provide their process requirements by uploading process documents or simply describing their business process in a natural language. From the documents or description, Amazon Quick Automate creates a plan with steps and actions for your automation. You can expand upon the plan by adding additional steps or actions or modify the existing steps or actions. You can add additional steps by dragging actions or steps from an extensive Actions library.

Amazon Quick Automate's intelligent agents can seamlessly navigate and interact with web applications, make contextual decisions based on real-time data, execute API calls, and even generate custom code to handle complex scenarios. When human oversight is required, the system can create human-in-the-loop tasks for manual review or approval.

## Key concepts

**Automation groups**

Automation groups create logical groupings for automations, allowing organizations to manage permissions and resources efficiently across different departments or projects. These groups provide a way to organize your automations and setup permissions based on business units, functional areas, or project teams.

By organizing automations into groups, you can apply consistent access controls, resource restrictions, and governance policies. This organizational structure supports scalable automation management as your organization's automation needs grow and evolve.

**Project**

A _project_ is the primary container that encapsulates all metadata, assets, and contextual information related to an automation initiative. It serves as the foundational unit for organizing, authoring, testing, deploying, and maintaining automations across their lifecycle.

**Lifecycle of a project**

- **Create a project:** Define the automation's scope including its name, purpose, business case, and attach process documentation.
- **Build automation:** Within the project, build and test and automation.
- **Version and deploy:** Publish automation versions for testing or production. Projects maintain version history and deployment status.
- **Monitor and iterate:** Review logs, metrics, for each run and iterate on the automation. Each iteration creates traceable project-level change history.

**Automations**

An _automation_ is a visual artifact that represents the executable logic of a process. It is created using the _Visual Designer_ within , where you define the sequence of actions, decisions, and agent interactions needed to complete a business process. Each automation serves as the operational blueprint for how work is performed, combining AI-powered agents, system actions, and human inputs in a unified flow.

**Actions**

Actions are the building blocks for your automations. Each action performs a specific task, from reading data to interacting with external systems.

**Agents**

An _agent_ is an AI-powered action that can understand natural language input, reason through scenarios, and perform complex tasks on your behalf. Agents bring intelligence and adaptability to automations by interpreting intent, handling variability, and executing actions dynamically.

- **UI agent** is a native agent that understands natural language instructions to perform complex browser actions. It can autonomously navigate websites, click, type, read data, and produce structured outputs optimized for downstream automation steps.
- **Custom agent** is an AI-powered action that processes natural language inputs to automate complex steps using integrated tool-calling capabilities. It primarily uses integrations as its tool interface, while offering extensibility to use Code as tool, and other native actions like human-in-the-loop task. The agent delivers structured, predictable outputs optimized for seamless integration into downstream automation steps.
