# Values in a Microsoft Excel file

with scientific notation don't format correctly in Quick Sight

When you connect to a Microsoft Excel file that has a number column that contains
values with scientific notation, they might not format correctly in Quick Sight.
For example, the value 1.59964E+11, which is actually 159964032802, formats as
159964000000 in Quick Sight. This can lead to an incorrect analysis.

To resolve this issue, format the column as `Text` in Microsoft Excel,
and then upload the file to Quick Sight.
