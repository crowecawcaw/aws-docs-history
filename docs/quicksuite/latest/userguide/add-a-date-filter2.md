# Adding date filters

You create filters on date fields by selecting the filter conditions and date values
that you want to use. There are three filter types for dates:

- Range – A series of dates based on a
  time range and comparison type. You can filter records based on whether the date
  field value is before or after a specified date, or within a date range. You
  enter date values in the format MM/DD/YYYY. You can use the following comparison
  types:

      + Between – Between a start date
       and an end date
      + After – After a specified
       date
      + Before – Before a specified
       date
      + Equals – On a specified
       date

  For each comparison type, you can alternatively choose a rolling date relative
  to a period or dataset value.

- Relative (analyses only) – A series of
  date and time elements based on the current date. You can filter records based
  on the current date and your selected unit of measure (UOM). Date filter units
  include years, quarters, months, weeks, days, hours, and minutes. You can
  exclude current period, add support for Next N filters similar to Last N with an
  added capability to allow for Anchor date. You can use the following comparison
  types:
  - Previous – The previous
    UOM—for example, the previous year.
  - This – This UOM, which includes
    all dates and times that fall within the select UOM, even if they occur
    in the future.
  - To date _or_ up to
    now – UOM to date, or UOM up to now. The displayed
    phrase adapts to the UOM that you choose. However, in all cases this
    option filters out data that is not between the beginning of the current
    UOM and the current moment.
  - Last _n_ – The last specified number of the
    given UOM, which includes all of this UOM and all of the last _n_ −1 UOM. For example, let's
    say today is May 10, 2017. You choose to use _years_
    as your UOM, and set Last _n_ years to
  3. The filtered data includes data for all of 2017, plus all of 2016,
     and all of 2015. If you have any data for the future dates of the
     current year (2017 in this example), these records are included in your
     dataset.

- Top and bottom (analyses only) – A
  number of date entries ranked by another field. You can show the top or bottom
  _n_ for the type of date or time UOM you
  choose, based on values in another field. For example, you can choose to show
  the top 5 sales days based on revenue.
  Comparisons are applied inclusive to the date specified. For example, if you apply the
  filter `Before 1/1/16`, the records returned include all rows with date
  values through 1/1/16 23:59:59. If you don't want to include the date specified,
  you can clear the option to **Include this date**. If you want to omit
  a time range, you can use the **Exclude the last N periods** option to
  specify the number and type of time periods (minutes, days, and so on) to filter
  out.

You can also choose to include or exclude nulls, or exclusively show rows that contain
nulls in this field. If you pass in a null date
parameter (one without a default value), it doesn't filter the data until you
provide a value.

###### Note

If a column or attribute has no time zone information, then the client query
engine sets the default interpretation of that date-time data. For example, suppose
that a column contains a timestamp, rather than a timestamptz, and you are in a
different time zone than the data's origin. In this case, the engine can render
the timestamp differently than you expect. Amazon Quick Suite and [SPICE](spice.md "spice.md") both use Universal Coordinated Time (UTC)
times.

Use the following sections to learn how to create date filters in datasets and
analyses.

## Creating date filters in

datasets

Use the following procedure to create a range filter for a date field in a
dataset.

###### To create a range filter for a date field in a dataset

1. Create a new filter using a text field. For more information about
   creating filters, see [Adding filters](add-a-filter-data-prep.md "add-a-filter-data-prep.md").
2. In the **Filters** pane, choose the new filter to expand
   it.
3. For **Condition**, choose a comparison type:
   **Between**, **After**, or
   **Before**.

To use **Between** as a comparison, choose
**Start date** and **End date** and
choose dates from the date picker controls that appear.

You can choose if you want to include either or both the start and end
dates in the range by selecting **Include start date** or
**Include end date**.

To use **Before** or **After**
comparisons, enter a date or choose the date field to bring up the date
picker control and choose a date instead. You can include this date (the one
you chose), to exclude the last N time periods, and specify how to handle
nulls. 4. For **Time granularity**, choose
**Day**, **Hour**,
**Minute**, or **Second**. 5. When finished, choose **Apply**.

## Creating date filters in

analyses

You can create date filters in analyses as described following.

### Creating range date filters in

analyses

Use the following procedure to create a range filter for a date field in an
analysis.

###### To create a range filter for a date field in an analysis

1. Create a new filter using a text field. For more information about
   creating filters, see [Adding filters](add-a-filter-data-prep.md "add-a-filter-data-prep.md").
2. In the **Filters** pane, choose the new filter to
   expand it.
3. For **Filter type**, choose **Date & time
   range**.
4. For **Condition**, choose a comparison type:
   **Between**, **After**,
   **Before**, or **Equals**.

To use **Between** as a comparison, choose
**Start date** and **End date**
and choose dates from the date picker controls that appear.

You can choose to include either or both the start and end dates in
the range by selecting **Include start date** or
**Include end date**.

To use a **Before**, **After**, or
**Equals** comparison, enter a date or choose the
date field to bring up the date picker control and choose a date
instead. You can include this date (the one you chose), to exclude the
last N time periods, and specify how to handle nulls.

To **Set a rolling date** for your comparison, choose
**Set a rolling date**.

In the **Set a rolling date** pane that opens, choose
**Relative date** and then select if you want to
set the date to **Today**,
**Yesterday**, or you can specify the
**Filter condition** (start of or end of),
**Range** (this, previous, or next), and
**Period** (year, quarter, month, week, or
day). 5. For **Time granularity**, choose
**Day**, **Hour**,
**Minute**, or **Second**. 6. (Optional) If you are filtering by using an existing parameter,
instead of specific dates, choose **Use parameters**,
then choose your parameter or parameters from the list. To use
**Before**, **After**, or
**Equals** comparisons, choose one date parameter.
You can include this date in the range.

To use **Between**, enter both the start date and end
date parameters separately. You can include the start date, the end
date, or both in the range.

To use parameters in a filter, create them first. Usually, you create
a parameter, add a control for it, and then add a filter for it. For
more information, see [Parameters in Amazon Quick Suite](parameters-in-quicksight.md "parameters-in-quicksight.md"). 7. For **Null options** choose **Exclude
nulls**, **Include nulls**, or
**Nulls only**. 8. When finished, choose **Apply**.

### Creating relative date filters

in analyses

Use the following procedure to create a relative filter for a date field in an
analysis.

###### To create a relative filter for a date field in an analysis

1. Create a new filter using a text field. For more information about
   creating filters, see [Adding filters](add-a-filter-data-prep.md "add-a-filter-data-prep.md").
2. In the **Filters** pane, choose the new filter to
   expand it.
3. For **Filter type**, choose **Relative
   dates**.
4. For **Time granularity**, choose a granularity of
   time that you want to filter by (days, hours, minutes).
5. For **Period**, choose a unit of time (years,
   quarters, quarters, months, weeks, days).
6. For **Range**, choose how you want the filter to
   relate to the time frame. For example, if you choose to report on
   months, your options are previous month, this month, month to date, last
   N months, and next N months.

If you choose Last N or Next N years, quarters, months, weeks, or
days, enter a number for **Number of**. For example,
last 3 years, next 5 quarters, last 5 days. 7. For **Null options** choose **Exclude
nulls**, **Include nulls**, or
**Nulls only**. 8. For **Set dates relative to**, choose one of the
following options:

    * **Current date time** – If you choose
     this option, you can set it to **Exclude
     last**, and then specify the number and type of time
     periods.
    * **Date and time from a parameter** –
     If you choose this option, you can select an existing datetime
     parameter.

9. (Optional) If you are filtering by using an existing parameter,
   instead of specific dates, enable **Use parameters**,
   then choose your parameter or parameters from the list.

To use parameters in a filter, create them first. Usually, you create
a parameter, add a control for it, and then add a filter for it. For
more information, see [Parameters in Amazon Quick Suite](parameters-in-quicksight.md "parameters-in-quicksight.md"). 10. When finished, choose **Apply**.

### Creating top and bottom date

filters in analyses

Use the following procedure to create a top and bottom filter for a date field
in an analysis.

###### To create a top and bottom filter for a date field in an analysis

1. Create a new filter using a text field. For more information about
   creating filters, see [Adding filters](add-a-filter-data-prep.md "add-a-filter-data-prep.md").
2. In the **Filters** pane, choose the new filter to
   expand it.
3. For **Filter type**, choose **Top and
   bottom**.
4. Select **Top** or **Bottom**.
5. For **Show**, enter the number of top or bottom items
   you want to show and choose a unit of time (years, quarters, months,
   weeks days, hours, minutes).
6. For **By**, choose a field to base the ranking
   on.
7. (Optional) Add another field as a tie breaker, if the field for
   **By** has duplicates. Choose **Tie
   breaker**, and then choose another field. To remove a tie
   breaker, use the delete icon.
8. (Optional) If you are filtering by using an existing parameter,
   instead of specific dates, select **Use parameters**,
   then choose your parameter or parameters from the list.

To use a parameter for **Top and bottom**, choose an
integer parameter for the number of top or bottom items to show.

To use parameters in a filter, create them first. Usually, you create
a parameter, add a control for it, and then add a filter for it. For
more information, see [Parameters in Amazon Quick Suite](parameters-in-quicksight.md "parameters-in-quicksight.md"). 9. When finished, choose **Apply**.
