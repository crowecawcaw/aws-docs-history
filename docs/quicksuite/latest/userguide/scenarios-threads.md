# Working with threads in an Amazon Quick Sight scenario

After you create a scenario in Quick Sight, the data that Amazon Q generates is
presented in _threads_ and _blocks_. A thread is a
vertical chain of prompts and responses. A block is a single prompt and response pair.
Each thread can contain up to 15 blocks, and each scenario can contain up to 50 blocks
total across multiple threads.

When a new thread is created, a list of Amazon Q-generated prompts appears inside of a
new block. When you choose one of the prompts to drill down on, Amazon Q analyzes the data
that is relevant to the chosen prompt and returns a summary of all data findings,
forecasts, and conclusions that can be drawn from the analysis.

To continue the thread and dive deeper into the prompt, choose the plus sign
(**+**) located below the block to create a new block that contains
a new list of generated prompts that factor in the findings from the previous block. To
start a new thread that analyzes a different aspect of the data, choose the plus sign
(**+**) above any block in the scenario to create a new thread.

Blocks can be collapsed, duplicated, or deleted from a scenario, as long as the block
that you want to change has finished loading. Use the following procedures to make
changes to a scenario block.

###### To collapse, duplicate, or delete a block

1.  Open the [Quick Suite console](https://quicksight.aws.amazon.com/ "https://quicksight.aws.amazon.com/").
2.  Choose **Scenarios** from the options pane, and then choose
    the scenario that you want to change.
3.  Navigate to the block that you want to change and choose the ellipsis
    (…) in the top right of the block.
4.  Perform one of the following actions:

        * To collapse the block, choose **Collapse**. To expand
         a collapsed block, choose the ellipsis in the top right of the block,
         and then choose **Expand**.
        * To duplicate the block, choose **Duplicate**. The
         block is duplicated and placed in a new thread next to the original
         block.
        * To delete the block, choose **Delete**.

    You can also modify the prompt of a block to better match your use case. Use the
    following procedure to modify a block prompt.

###### To modify the prompt of a block

1. Open the [Quick Suite console](https://quicksight.aws.amazon.com/ "https://quicksight.aws.amazon.com/").
2. Choose **Scenarios** from the options pane, and then choose
   the scenario that you want to change.
3. Navigate to the block that you want to change and choose **Modify
   block**.
4. In the **Modify block** popup that appears, enter a new
   description for the block, and then choose **Apply**.
   After you modify a prompt, Amazon Q analyzes the data and returns a new generated
   analysis that reflects the changes that were made to the prompt.
