# Forecasting and creating what-if scenarios with

Amazon Quick Sight

Using ML-powered forecasting, you can forecast your key business metrics with
point-and-click simplicity. No machine learning expertise is required. The built-in ML
algorithm in Amazon Quick Sight is designed to handle complex real-world scenarios. Amazon Quick Sight uses
machine learning to help provide more reliable forecasts than available by traditional
means.

For example, suppose that you are a business manager. Suppose that you want to
forecast sales to see if you are going to meet your goal by the end of the year. Or,
suppose that you expect a large deal to come through in two weeks and you want to know
how it's going to affect your overall forecast.

You can forecast your business revenue with multiple levels of seasonality (for
example, sales with both weekly and quarterly trends). Amazon Quick Sight automatically excludes
anomalies in the data (for example, a spike in sales due to price drop or promotion)
from influencing the forecast. You also don't have to clean and reprep the data
with missing values because Amazon Quick Sight automatically handles that. In addition, with
ML-powered forecasting, you can perform interactive what-if analyses to determine the
growth trajectory you need to meet business goals.

## Using forecasts and what-if scenarios

You can add a forecasting widget to your existing analysis, and publish it as a
dashboard. To analyze what-if scenarios, use an analysis, not a dashboard. With
ML-powered forecasting, Amazon Quick Sight enables you to forecast complex, real-world
scenarios such as data with multiple seasonality. It automatically excludes outliers
that it identifies and imputes missing values.

Use the following procedure to add a graphical forecast to your analysis, and
explore what-if scenarios.

Although the following procedure is for graphical forecasting, you can also add a
forecast as a narrative in an insight widget. To learn more, see [Creating autonarratives with Amazon Quick Sight](narratives-creating.md "narratives-creating.md").

ML-powered forecasting is not compatible with [small multiples](small-multiples.md "small-multiples.md"). To ensure accurate
display of data and forecasts, avoid using small multiples in your
visualizations.

###### To add a graphical forecast to your analysis

1. Create a visual that uses a single date field and up to three metrics
   (measures).
2. On the menu in the upper-right corner of the visual, choose the
   **Menu options** icon (the three dots), and then choose
   **Add forecast**.

Quick Sight automatically analyzes the historical data using ML, and
displays a graphical forecast for the next 14 periods. Forecast properties
apply to all metrics in your visual. If you want individual forecasts for
each metric, consider creating a separate visual for each metric and adding
a forecast to each.

one or more of the following settings:

    * **Forecast length** – Set
     **Periods forward** to forecast, or set
     **Periods backward** to look for patterns to
     base the forecast on.
    * **Prediction interval** – Set the
     estimated range for the forecast. Doing this changes how wide the
     band of possibility is around the predicted line.
    * **Seasonality** – Set the number of time
     periods involved in the predictable seasonal pattern of data. The
     range is 1–180, and the default setting is
     **Automatic**.
    * **Forecast boundaries** – Set a minimum
     and/or maximum forecast value to prevent forecast values from going
     above or below a specified value. For example, if your forecasting
     predicts the number of new hires the company will make in the next
     month to be in the negative numbers, you can set a forecast boundary
     minimum to zero. This stops the forecasted values from ever going
     below zero.

To save your changes, choose **Apply**.

If your forecast contains multiple metrics, you can isolate one of the
forecasts by selecting anywhere inside the orange band. When you do this,
the other forecasts disappear. Select the isolated forecast band again to
have them reappear. 4. Analyze what-if scenarios by choosing a forecasted data point (in the
orange band) on the chart, and then choosing **What-if
analysis** from the context menu.

The **What-if analysis** panel opens at left. Set the
following options:

    * **Scenario** – Set a target for a date, or
     set a target for a time range.
    * **Dates** – If you are setting
     a target for a specific date, enter that date here. If you are using
     a time range, set the start and end dates.
    * **Target** – Set a target value for the
     metric.

Amazon Quick Sight adjusts the forecast to meet the target.

###### Note

The **What-if analysis** option isn't available
for multiple-metric forecasts. If you want to perform a what-if scenario
on your forecast, your visual should contain only one metric. 5. Keep your changes by choosing **Apply**. To discard them,
close the **What-if analysis** panel.

If you keep your changes, you see the new forecast adjusted for the
target, alongside the original forecast without the what-if.

The what-if analysis is represented on the visual as a dot on the metric
line. You can hover over the data points on the forecasting line to see the
details.

Here are other things you can do:

- To interact with or remove a what-if analysis, choose the dot on the
  metric line.
- To create additional what-if scenarios, close the what-if analysis before
  choosing a new point on the line.

###### Note

What-if analyses can exist inside an analysis only, not inside a
dashboard.
