# My visual can’t find the

query table

In this case, the visuals in your analysis aren't working as expected. The error
message says `"Amazon Quick Sight can’t find the query table."`

The most common cause of this error is that your data source schema changed. For
example, it's possible a table name changed from `x_table` to
`y_table`.

Depending on how the dataset accesses the data source, choose one of the
following.

- If the dataset is based on custom SQL, do one or more of the
  following:

      + Edit the dataset.
      + Edit the SQL statement.


      For example, if the table name changed from `x_table`
       to `y_table`, you can update the FROM clause in the SQL
       statement to refer to the new table instead.

  When you're done, choose **Save & visualize**, then
  choose each visual and readd the fields as needed.

- If the dataset isn't based on custom SQL, do the following:
  1.  Create a new dataset using the new table, `y_table` for
      example.
  2.  Open your analysis.
  3.  Replace the original dataset with the newly created dataset. If
      there are no column changes, all the visuals should work after you
      replace the dataset. For more information, see [Replacing datasets](replacing-data-sets.md "replacing-data-sets.md").
