# Using Highcharts

Use Highcharts visuals to create custom chart types and visuals that use the [Highcharts Core
library](https://www.highcharts.com/blog/products/highcharts/ "https://www.highcharts.com/blog/products/highcharts/"). Highcharts visuals provide Quick Suite authors direct access
to the [Highcharts
API](https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/ "https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/").

To configure a Highcharts visual, Quick Suite authors need to add a Highcharts
JSON schema to the visual in Quick Suite. Authors can use Quick Suite
expressions to reference Quick Suite fields, and formatting options in the JSON
schema that they use to generate the Highcharts visual. The JSON **Chart
code** editor provides contextual assistance for autocomplete and real time
validation to ensure that the input JSON schemas are configured properly. To maintain
security, the Highcharts visual editor does not accept CSS, JavaScript, or HTML code
input.

## Considerations

Before you start creating Highcharts visuals in Amazon Quick Suite, review the following
limitations that apply to Highcharts visuals.

- The following JSON values are not supported in the Highcharts
  **Chart code** JSON editor:
  - Functions
  - Dates
  - Undefined values

- Links to GeoJSON files or other images are not supported for Highcharts
  visuals.
- Field colors are not available for Highcharts visuals. Default theme
  colors are applied to all Highcharts visuals.

## Creating a Highcharts visual

Use the following procedure to create a Highcharts visual in Amazon Quick Suite.

1. Open the [Quick Suite console](https://quicksight.aws.amazon.com/ "https://quicksight.aws.amazon.com/").
2. Open the Quick Suite analysis that you want to add a Highcharts
   visual to.
3. On the application bar, choose **Add**, and then choose
   **Add visual**.
4. On the **Visual types** pane, choose the Highcharts
   visual icon. An empty visual appears on the analysis sheet and the
   **Properties** pane opens on the left.
5. In the **Properties** pane, expand the **Display
   settings** section and perform the following actions:
   1. For **Edit title**, choose the paintbrush icon,
      enter the title that you want the visual to have, and then choose
      **SAVE**. Alternatively, choose the eyeball
      icon to hide the title.
   2. (Optional) For **Edit subtitle**, choose the
      paintbrush icon, enter the subtitle that you want the visual to
      have, and then choose **SAVE**. Alternatively,
      choose the eyeball icon to hide the subtitle.
   3. (Optional) For **Alt text**, add the alt text
      that you want the visual to have.

6. Expand the **Data point limit** section. For
   **Number of data points to show**, enter the number of
   data points that you want the visual to show. Highcharts visuals can show up
   to 10,000 data points.
7. Expand the **Chart code** section.
8. Enter a JSON schema into the **Chart code** JSON editor.
   The editor provides contextual assistance and real time validation to ensure
   that your input JSON is configured properly. Any errors that
   Quick Suite identifies can be viewed in the
   **Errors** dropdown. The example below shows a JSON
   schema that creates a lipstick chart that shows current year sales by
   industry.

```
{
  "xAxis": {
    "categories": ["getColumn", 0]
  },
  "yAxis": {
    "min": 0,
    "title": {
      "text": "Amount ($)"
    }
  },
  "tooltip": {
    "headerFormat": "<span style='font-size:10px'>{point.key}</span><table>",
    "pointFormat": "<tr><td style='color:{series.color};padding:0'>{series.name}: </td><td style='padding:0'><b>${point.y:,.0f}</b></td></tr>",
    "footerFormat": "</table>",
    "shared": true,
    "useHTML": true
  },
  "plotOptions": {
    "column": {
      "borderWidth": 0,
      "grouping": false,
      "shadow": false
    }
  },
  "series": [
    {
      "type": "column",
      "name": "Current Year Sales",
      "color": "rgba(124,181,236,1)",
      "data": ["getColumn", 1],
      "pointPadding": 0.3,
      "pointPlacement": 0.0
    }
  ]
}
```

9. Choose **APPLY CODE**. Quick Suite converts the
   JSON schema into a visual that appears in the analysis. To make changes to
   the rendered visual, update the appropriate properties in the JSON schema
   and choose **APPLY CODE**.
10. (Optional) Open the **Reference** dropdown to access
    links to helpful Highctarts reference material.

When you are happy with the rendered visual, close the properties pane. For more
information about Quick Sight specific expressions that can be used to configure a
Highcharts visual, see [Amazon Quick Suite JSON expression language for
Highcharts visuals](highchart-expressions.md "highchart-expressions.md").

## Interactive Highchart features

Highchart visualizations in Amazon Quick Sight support custom actions, highlighting, and
custom field color consistencies, allowing you to create interactive and visually
cohesive charts that integrate seamlessly with other Quick Sight visuals.

### Custom actions

With custom actions, you can define specific behaviors for any data point in
your Highchart visualizations. This feature seamlessly integrates with
Quick Sight's existing action framework, enabling you to create
interactive charts that respond to user clicks. The system currently supports
single data point selection, giving you precise control over user interactions.
Custom actions can be implemented across various chart types, including line
charts, bar charts, and stacked bar charts, among others.

To implement custom actions, you'll need to modify your Highcharts JSON
configuration. Add an event block to your series configuration, specifying the
click event and the corresponding action. For example:

```
{
  "series": [{
    "type": "line",
    "data": ["getColumn", 1],
    "name": "value",
    "events": {
      "click": [
        "triggerClick", { "rowIndex": "point.index" }
      ]
    }
}]
```

This configuration enables click events on your chart's data points, allowing
Quick Sight to handle custom actions based on the selected data.

### Cross-visual highlighting

Cross-visual highlighting enhances the interactivity of your dashboards by
creating visual connections between different charts. When a user selects
elements in one chart, related elements in other visuals are automatically
highlighted, while unrelated elements are dimmed. This feature helps users
quickly identify relationships and patterns across multiple visualizations,
improving data comprehension and analysis.

To enable cross-visual highlighting and maintain field color consistency, use
the `quicksight` clause in your Highcharts JSON configuration. This
clause acts as a bridge between Highcharts rendering and Quick Suite's visual
interaction system. Here's an example of how to set it up:

```
{
  "quicksight": {
    "pointRender": ["updatePointAttributes", {
      "opacity": ["case",
        ["dataMarkMatch", ["getColumnName", 0], "series.name"],
        1,  // Full opacity for matching elements
        0.1 // Dim non-matching elements
      ],
      "color": ["getColumnColorOverrides", ["getColumnName", 0], "series.name"]
    }]
  }
}
```

This configuration uses Quick Sight's JSON expression language to dynamically
modify visual properties like opacity and color based on user interactions and
predefined color schemes.

For more complex scenarios, you can set up highlighting based on multiple
conditions. This allows for more nuanced interactivity in your visualizations.
The following example highlights elements based on either the quarter or day of
the week:

```
{
  "quicksight": {
    "pointRender": ["updatePointAttributes", {
      "opacity": ["case",
        ["||",
          ["dataMarkMatch", "quarter", "series.name"],
          ["dataMarkMatch", "day_of_week", "point.name"]
        ],
        1,  // Full opacity for matching elements
        0.1 // Dim non-matching elements
      ],
    }]
  }
}
```

### Field-level color consistency

Maintaining visual coherence across your dashboard is crucial for effective
data interpretation. The field-level color consistency feature ensures that
colors assigned to specific dimensions perist across all visuals in your
dashboard. This consistency helps users quickly recognize and track particular
data categories across different chart types and views, enhancing the overall
user experience and data comprehension.
