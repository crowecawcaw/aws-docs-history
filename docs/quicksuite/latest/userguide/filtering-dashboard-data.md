# Using filters on Amazon Quick Sight dashboard

data

You can use filters to refine the data displayed in a visual. Filters are applied
to the data before any aggregate functions. If you have multiple filters, all
top-level filters apply together using AND. If the filters are grouped inside a
top-level filter, the filters in the group apply using OR.

Amazon Quick Sight applies all of the enabled filters to the field. For example, suppose that
there is one filter of `state = WA` and another filter of `sales >=
 500`. In this case, the dataset contains only records that meet both of
those criteria. If you disable one of these, only one filter applies. Take care that
multiple filters applied to the same field aren't mutually exclusive.

## Viewing filters

To see the existing filters, choose **Filter** on the element
settings menu, then choose to view filters. The filters display in the
**Applied filters** panel in order of creation, with the
oldest filter on top.

### Understanding filter icons in an Amazon Quick Sight dashboard

Filters in the **Applied filters** panel display icons to
indicate how they are scoped and whether they are enabled.

A filter that isn't enabled is grayed out, and you can't select its check
box.

One of several scope icons displays to the right of the filter name to
indicate the scope set on that filter. The scope icon resembled four boxes
in a square. If all boxes are filled, the filter applies to all visuals on
the analysis sheet. If only one box is filled, the filter applies to the
selected visual only. If some boxes are filled, the filter applies to some
of the visuals on the sheet, including the one currently selected.

The scope icons match the ones that display on the filter menu when you
are choosing the scope for the filter.

### Viewing

filter details in an Amazon Quick Sight dashboard

To see filter details, choose **Filter** at left. The
filter view retains your last selection. So when you open
**Filter**, you see either the **Applied
filters** or the **Edit filter** view.

In the **Applied filters** view, you can choose any
filter to view its details. The filters in this list can change depending on
the scope of the filter, and which visual you currently have
selected.

You can close the **Edit filter** view by choosing the
selector on the right. Doing this resets the **Filter**
view.
