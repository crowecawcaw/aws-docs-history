# SPICE ingestion error

codes

The following list of errors codes and descriptions can help you understand and
troubleshoot issues with data ingestion into SPICE.

## Error codes for skipped

rows

The following list of errors codes and descriptions can help you understand and
troubleshoot issues with skipped rows.

**ARITHMETIC_EXCEPTION** – An arithmetic exception
occurred while processing a value.

**ENCODING_EXCEPTION**
– An unknown exception occurred while converting and encoding data to
SPICE.

**OPENSEARCH_CURSOR_NOT_ENABLED** – The OpenSearch
domain doesn't have SQL cursors enabled (`"opendistro.sql.cursor.enabled" :
 "true"`). For more information, see [Authorizing connections to Amazon OpenSearch Service](opensearch.md "opensearch.md").

**INCORRECT_FIELD_COUNT** – One or more rows have too
many fields. Make sure that the number of fields in each row matches the number of
fields defined in the schema.

**INCORRECT_SAGEMAKER_OUTPUT_FIELD_COUNT** – The
SageMaker AI output has an unexpected number of fields.

**INDEX_OUT_OF_BOUNDS** – The system requested an index
that isn't valid for the array or list being processed.

**MALFORMED_DATE**
– A value in a field can't be transformed to a valid date. For example, if
you try to convert a field that contains a value like `"sale date"` or
`"month-1"`, the action generates a malformed date error. To fix this
error, remove nondate values from your data source. Check that you aren't importing
a file with a column header mixed into the data. If your string contains a date or
time that doesn't convert, see [Using unsupported or custom dates](using-unsupported-dates.md "using-unsupported-dates.md").

**MISSING_SAGEMAKER_OUTPUT_FIELD** – A field in the
SageMaker AI output is unexpectedly empty.

**NUMBER_BITWIDTH_TOO_LARGE** – A numeric value exceeds
the length supported in SPICE. For example, your numeric value has
more than 19 digits, which is the length of a `bigint` data type. For a
long numeric sequence that isn't a mathematical value, use a `string`
data type.

**NUMBER_PARSE_FAILURE** – A value in a numeric field is
not a number. For example, a field with a data type of `int` contains a
string or a float.

**SAGEMAKER_OUTPUT_COLUMN_TYPE_MISMATCH** – The data
type defined in the SageMaker AI schema doesn't match the data type received from SageMaker AI.

**STRING_TRUNCATION**
– A string is being truncated by SPICE. Strings are truncated
where the length of the string exceeds the SPICE quota. For more
information about SPICE, see [Importing data into SPICE](spice.md "spice.md"). For more information about quotas, see [Service Quotas](../../../servicequotas/latest/userguide/intro.md "../../../servicequotas/latest/userguide/intro.md").

**UNDEFINED** –
An unknown error occurred while ingesting data.

**UNSUPPORTED_DATE_VALUE** – A date field contains a
date that is in a supported format but is not in the supported range of dates, for
example "12/31/1399" or "01/01/10000". For more information, see
[Using unsupported or custom dates](using-unsupported-dates.md "using-unsupported-dates.md").

## Error codes during data import

For imports and data refresh jobs that fail, Quick Sight provides an error code
indicating what caused the failure. The following list of errors codes and
descriptions can help you understand and troubleshoot issues with data ingestion
into SPICE.

**ACCOUNT_CAPACITY_LIMIT_EXCEEDED** – This data
exceeds your current SPICE capacity. Purchase more
SPICE capacity or clean up existing SPICE data and
then retry this ingestion.

**CONNECTION_FAILURE**
– Amazon Quick Sight can't connect to your data source. Check the data source
connection settings and try again.

**CUSTOMER_ERROR**
– There was a problem parsing the data. If this persists, contact Amazon Quick Sight
technical support.

**DATA_SET_DELETED**
– The data source or dataset was deleted or became unavailable during
ingestion.

**DATA_SET_SIZE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED** – This dataset
exceeds the maximum allowable SPICE dataset size. Use filters to
reduce the dataset size and try again. For information on SPICE
quotas, see [Data source quotas](data-source-limits.md "data-source-limits.md").

**DATA_SOURCE_AUTH_FAILED** – Data source authentication
failed. Check your credentials and use the **Edit data source**
option to replace expired credentials.

**DATA_SOURCE_CONNECTION_FAILED** – Data source
connection failed. Check the URL and try again. If this error persists, contact your
data source administrator for assistance.

**DATA_SOURCE_NOT_FOUND** – No data source found. Check
your Amazon Quick Sight data sources.

**DATA_TOLERANCE_EXCEPTION** – There are too many
invalid rows. Amazon Quick Sight has reached the quota of rows that it can skip and still
continue ingesting. Check your data and try again.

**FAILURE_TO_ASSUME_ROLE** – Amazon Quick Sight couldn't assume the
correct AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role. Verify the policies for
`Amazon Quick Sight-service-role` in the IAM console.

**FAILURE_TO_PROCESS_JSON_FILE** – Amazon Quick Sight
couldn't parse a manifest file as valid JSON.

**IAM_ROLE_NOT_AVAILABLE** – Amazon Quick Sight doesn't have
permission to access the data source. To manage Amazon Quick Sight permissions on AWS
resources, go to the **Security and Permissions** page under the
**Manage Amazon Quick Sight** option as an administrator.

**INGESTION_CANCELED**
– The ingestion was canceled by the user.

**INGESTION_SUPERSEDED** – This ingestion has been
superseded by another workflow. This happens when a new ingestion is created while
another one is still in progress. Avoid manually editing the dataset multiple times
in a short period, because each manual edit creates a new ingestion which will
supersede and end the previous ingestion.

**INTERNAL_SERVICE_ERROR** – An internal service error
occurred.

**INVALID_DATA_SOURCE_CONFIG** – Invalid values appeared
in connection settings. Check your connection details and try again.

**INVALID_DATAPREP_SYNTAX** – Your calculated field
expression contains invalid syntax. Correct the syntax and try again.

**INVALID_DATE_FORMAT** – An invalid date format
appeared.

**IOT_DATA_SET_FILE_EMPTY** – No AWS IoT Analytics data
was found. Check your account and try again.

**IOT_FILE_NOT_FOUND**
– An indicated AWS IoT Analytics file wasn't found. Check your account and
try again.

**OAUTH_TOKEN_FAILURE** – Credentials to the data source
have expired. Renew your credentials and retry this ingestion.

**PASSWORD_AUTHENTICATION_FAILURE** – Incorrect
credentials appeared for a data source. Update your data source credentials and
retry this ingestion.

**PERMISSION_DENIED**
– Access to the requested resources was denied by the data source. Request
permissions from your database administrator or ensure proper permission has been
granted to Amazon Quick Sight before retrying.

**QUERY_TIMEOUT**
– A query to the data source timed out waiting for a response. Check your
data source logs and try again.

**ROW_SIZE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED** – The row size quota
exceeded the maximum.

**S3_FILE_INACCESSIBLE** – Couldn't connect to an S3
bucket. Make sure that you grant Amazon Quick Sight and users necessary permissions before you
connect to the S3 bucket.

**S3_MANIFEST_ERROR**
– Couldn't connect to S3 data. Make sure that your S3 manifest file is valid.
Also verify access to the S3 data. Both Amazon Quick Sight and the Amazon Quick Sight user need
permissions to connect to the S3 data.

**S3_UPLOADED_FILE_DELETED** – The file or files for the
ingestion were deleted (between ingestions). Check your S3 bucket and try
again.

**SOURCE_API_LIMIT_EXCEEDED_FAILURE** – This
ingestion exceeds the API quota for this data source. Contact your data source
administrator for assistance.

**SOURCE_RESOURCE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED** – A SQL query
exceeds the resource quota of the data source. Examples of resources involved can
include the concurrent query quota, the connection quota, and physical server
resources. Contact your data source administrator for assistance.

**SPICE_TABLE_NOT_FOUND** – An Amazon Quick Sight data source or
dataset was deleted or became unavailable during ingestion. Check your dataset in
Amazon Quick Sight and try again. For more information, see [Troubleshooting skipped row
errors](troubleshooting-skipped-rows.md "troubleshooting-skipped-rows.md").

**SQL_EXCEPTION**
– A general SQL error occurred. This error can be caused by query timeouts,
resource constraints, unexpected data definition language (DDL) changes before or
during a query, and other database errors. Check your database settings and your
query, and try again.

**SQL_INVALID_PARAMETER_VALUE** – An invalid SQL
parameter appeared. Check your SQL and try again.

**SQL_NUMERIC_OVERFLOW** – Amazon Quick Sight encountered an
out-of-range numeric exception. Check related values and calculated columns for
overflows, and try again.

**SQL_SCHEMA_MISMATCH_ERROR** – The data source schema
doesn't match the Amazon Quick Sight dataset. Update your Amazon Quick Sight dataset definition.

**SQL_TABLE_NOT_FOUND** – Amazon Quick Sight can't find the
table in the data source. Verify the table specified in the dataset or custom SQL
and try again.

**SSL_CERTIFICATE_VALIDATION_FAILURE** – Amazon Quick Sight
can't validate the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) certificate on your database
server. Check the SSL status on that server with your database administrator and try
again.

**UNRESOLVABLE_HOST**
– Amazon Quick Sight can't resolve the host name of the data source. Verify the
host name of the data source and try again.

**UNROUTABLE_HOST**
– Amazon Quick Sight can't reach your data source because it's inside a
private network. Ensure that your private VPC connection is configured correctly in
Enterprise Edition, or allow Amazon Quick Sight IP address ranges to allow connectivity for
Standard Edition.
