# Refreshing SPICE data

## Refreshing a dataset

Use the following procedure to refresh a [SPICE](spice.md "spice.md") dataset based on an Amazon S3 or database data
source in the **Data** tab. If there is a schema change in a
database, Quick Sight will not be able to auto-detect it, resulting in an ingestion
failure. Edit and save the dataset to update the schema and avoid ingestion
failures.

###### To refresh SPICE data from the Data tab

1. Select **Data** from the left navigation menu. In the
   **Datasets** tab, choose the dataset to open it.
2. On the dataset details page that opens, choose the
   **Refresh** tab and then choose **Refresh
   now**.
3. Keep the refresh type as **Full refresh**.
4. If you are refreshing an Amazon S3 dataset, choose one of the following options
   for **S3 Manifest**:
   - To use the same manifest file you last provided to Amazon Quick Sight, choose
     **Existing Manifest**. If you have changed the
     manifest file at the file location or URL that you last provided,
     the data returned reflects those changes.
   - To specify a new manifest file by uploading it from your local
     network, choose **Upload Manifest**, and then
     choose **Upload manifest file**. For
     **Open**, choose a file, and then choose
     **Open**.
   - To specify a new manifest file by providing a URL, enter the URL
     of the manifest in **Input manifest URL**. You can
     find the manifest file URL in the Amazon S3 console by opening the
     context (right-click) menu for the manifest file, choosing
     **Properties**, and looking at the
     **Link** box.

5. Choose **Refresh**.
6. If you are refreshing an Amazon S3 dataset, choose **OK**,
   then **OK** again.

If you are refreshing a database dataset, choose
**OK**.

## Incrementally refreshing a

dataset

| \*_Applies<br>to:_<br>• Enterprise Edition |

For SQL-based data sources, such as Amazon Redshift, Amazon Athena, PostgreSQL, or Snowflake,
you can refresh your data incrementally within a look-back window of time.

An _incremental refresh_ queries only data defined by the
dataset within a specified look-back window. It transfers all insertions, deletions,
and modifications to the dataset, within that window's timeframe, from its source to
the dataset. The data currently in SPICE that's within that window is
deleted and replaced with the updates.

With incremental refreshes, less data is queried and transferred for each refresh.
For example, let's say you have a dataset with 180,000 records that contains data
from January 1 to June 30. On July 1, you run an incremental refresh on the data
with a look-back window of seven days. Quick Sight queries the database asking for
all data since June 24 (7 days ago), which is 7,000 records. Quick Sight then
deletes the data currently in SPICE from June 24 and after, and
appends the newly queried data. The next day (July 2), Quick Sight does the same
thing, but queries from June 25 (7,000 records again), and then deletes from the
existing dataset from the same date. Rather than having to ingest 180,000 records
every day, it only has to ingest 7,000 records.

Use the following procedure to incrementally refresh a [SPICE](spice.md "spice.md") dataset based on a SQL data source from the
**Datasets** tab.

###### To incrementally refresh a SQL-based SPICE dataset

1. Choose **Data** from the left navigation menu. On the
   **Datasets** tab, choose the dataset to open it.
2. On the dataset details page that opens, choose the
   **Refresh** tab and then choose **Refresh
   now**.
3. For **Refresh type**, choose **Incremental
   refresh**.
4. If this is your first incremental refresh on the dataset, choose
   **Configure**.
5. On the **Configure incremental refresh** page, do the
   following:
   1. For **Date column**, choose a date column that
      you want to base the look-back window on.
   2. For **Window size**, enter a number for
      **size**, and then choose an amount of time
      that you want to look back for changes.

   You can choose to refresh changes to the data that occurred within
   a specified number of hours, days, or weeks from now. For example,
   you can choose to refresh changes to the data that occurred within
   two weeks of the current date.

6. Choose **Submit**.

## Refreshing a dataset during data

preparation

Use the following procedure to refresh a [SPICE](spice.md "spice.md") dataset based on an Amazon S3 or database data
source during data preparation.

###### To refresh SPICE data during data preparation

1. Choose **Data** from the left navigation menu. On the
   **Datasets** tab, choose the dataset, and then choose
   **Edit Data Set**.
2. On the dataset screen, choose **Refresh now**.
3. Keep the refresh type set to **Full refresh**.
4. (Optional) If you are refreshing an Amazon S3 dataset, choose one of the
   following options for **S3 Manifest**:
   - To use the same manifest file that you last provided to Amazon Quick Sight,
     choose **Existing Manifest**. If you have changed
     the manifest file at the file location or URL that you last
     provided, the data returned reflects those changes.
   - To specify a new manifest file by uploading it from your local
     network, choose **Upload Manifest**, and then
     choose **Upload manifest file**. For
     **Open**, choose a file, and then choose
     **Open**.
   - To specify a new manifest file by providing a URL, enter the URL
     of the manifest in **Input manifest URL**. You can
     find the manifest file URL in the Amazon S3 console by opening the
     context (right-click) menu for the manifest file, choosing
     **Properties**, and looking at the
     **Link** box.

5. Choose **Refresh**.
6. If you are refreshing an Amazon S3 dataset, choose **OK**,
   then **OK** again.

If you are refreshing a database dataset, choose
**OK**.

## Refreshing a dataset on a schedule

Use the following procedure to schedule refreshing the data. If your dataset is
based on a direct query and not stored in [SPICE](spice.md "spice.md"), you can refresh your data by opening the dataset.
You can also refresh your data by refreshing the page in an analysis or
dashboard.

###### To refresh [SPICE](spice.md "spice.md") data on a

schedule

1. Choose **Data** from the left navigation menu. On the
   **Datasets** tab, choose the dataset to open it.
2. On the dataset details page that opens, choose the
   **Refresh** tab and then choose **Add new
   schedule**.
3. On the **Create a refresh schedule** screen, choose
   settings for your schedule:
   1. For **Time zone**, choose the time zone that
      applies to the data refresh.
   2. For **Starting time**, choose a date and time for
      the refresh to start. Use HH:MM and 24-hour format, for example
      13:30.
   3. For **Frequency**, choose one of the
      following:
      - For Standard or Enterprise editions, you can choose
        **Daily**, **Weekly**,
        or **Monthly**.
        - **Daily**: Repeats every
          day.
        - **Weekly**: Repeats on the same
          day of each week.
        - **Monthly**: Repeats on the same
          day number of each month. To refresh data on the
          29th, 30th or 31st day of the month, choose
          **Last day of month** from the
          list.

      - For Enterprise edition only, you can choose
        **Hourly**. This setting refreshes your
        dataset every hour, beginning at the time that you choose.
        So, if you select 1:05 as the starting time, the data
        refreshes at five minutes after the hour, every hour.

      If you decide to use an hourly refresh, you can't also use
      additional refresh schedules. To create an hourly schedule,
      remove any other existing schedules for that dataset. Also,
      remove any existing hourly schedule before you create a
      daily, weekly, or monthly schedule.

4. Choose **Save**.

Scheduled dataset ingestions take place within 10 minutes of the scheduled date
and time.

Using the Quick Suite console, you can create five schedules for each
dataset. When you have created five, the **Create** button is
turned off.

| ------------------------------------------ |
| \*_Applies<br>to:_<br>• Enterprise Edition |

For SQL-based data sources, such as Amazon Redshift, Athena, PostgreSQL, or Snowflake, you can
schedule incremental refreshes. Use the following procedure to incrementally refresh
a [SPICE](spice.md "spice.md") dataset based on a SQL data
source in the **Datasets** tab.

###### To set an incremental refresh schedule for a SQL-based SPICE

dataset

1. Choose **Data** from the left navigation menu. On the
   **Datasets** tab, choose the dataset to open it.
2. On the dataset details page that opens, choose the
   **Refresh** tab and then choose **Add new
   schedule**.
3. On the **Create a schedule** page, for **Refresh
   type**, choose **Incremental refresh**.
4. If this is your first incremental refresh for this dataset, choose
   **Configure**, and then do the following:
   1. For **Date column**, choose a date column that
      you want to base the look-back window on.
   2. For **Window size**, enter a number for
      **size**, and then choose an amount of time
      that you want to look back for changes.

   You can choose to refresh changes to the data that occurred within
   a specified number of hours, days, or weeks from now. For example,
   you can choose to refresh changes to the data that occurred within
   two weeks of the current date. 3. Choose **Submit**.

5. For **Time zone**, choose the time zone that applies to
   the data refresh.
6. For **Repeats**, choose one of the following:
   - You can choose **Every 15 minutes**,
     **Every 30 minutes**,
     **Hourly**, **Daily**,
     **Weekly**, or
     **Monthly**.
     - **Every 15 minutes**: Repeats every 15
       minutes, beginning at the time you choose. So, if you select
       1:05 as the starting time, the data refreshes at 1:20, then
       again at 1:35, and so on.
     - **Every 30 minutes**: Repeats every 30
       minutes, beginning at the time you choose. So, if you select
       1:05 as the starting time, the data refreshes at 1:35, then
       again at 2:05, and so on.
     - **Hourly**: Repeats every hour, beginning
       at the time you choose. So, if you select 1:05 as the
       starting time, the data refreshes at five minutes after the
       hour, every hour.
     - **Daily**: Repeats every day.
     - **Weekly**: Repeats on the same day of
       each week.
     - **Monthly**: Repeats on the same day
       number of each month. To refresh data on the 29th, 30th or
       31st day of the month, choose **Last day of
       month** from the list.

   - If you decide to use refresh every 15 or 30 minutes, or hourly,
     you can't also use additional refresh schedules. To create a refresh
     schedule every 15 minutes, 30 minutes, or hourly, remove any other
     existing schedules for that dataset. Also, remove any existing
     minute or hourly schedule before you create a daily, weekly, or
     monthly schedule.

7. For **Starting**, choose a date for the refresh to
   start.
8. For **At**, specify the time that the refresh should
   start. Use HH:MM and 24-hour format, for example 13:30.

Scheduled dataset ingestions take place within 10 minutes of the scheduled date
and time.

In some cases, something might go wrong with the incremental refresh dataset that
makes you want to roll back your dataset. Or you might no longer want to refresh the
dataset incrementally. If so, you can delete the scheduled refresh.

To do so, choose the dataset on the **Datasets** page, choose
**Schedule a refresh**, and then choose the x icon to the right
of the scheduled refresh. Deleting an incremental refresh configuration starts a
full refresh. As part of this full refresh, all the configurations prepared for
incremental refreshes are removed.
