# Format a date field

When you format a date field, you can choose a list of common formatting
options. Or you can open the **Format data** pane to choose
from a list of common formats, or specify custom formatting for the date and
time values.

Changing a field format changes it for all visuals in the analysis that
use that dataset, but does not change it in the dataset itself.

If you want to format a date field by choosing from a list of common
options, you can access such a list in several ways. You can access it from
the **Field list** pane, a visual on-visual editor, or a
visual field well.

###### To change a date field's format by choosing a list option

1. Choose one of the following options:
   - In the **Field list** pane, choose the
     selector icon to the right of the number field that you want
     to format.
   - On any visual that contains an on-visual editor associated
     with the number field that you want to format, choose that
     on-visual editor. Expand the **Field
     wells** pane, and then choose the field well
     associated with the number field that you want to
     change.

2. Choose **Format**, and then choose the format
   that you want. The following quick formatting options are offered
   for date fields:
   - Show the month, day, year, and time.
   - Show the month, day, and year.
   - Show the month and year.
   - Show the year.

###### To manually change a date field's format

1. Choose one of the following options:
   - In the **Field list** pane, choose the
     selector icon to the right of the number field that you want
     to format.
   - On any visual that contains an on-visual editor associated
     with the number field that you want to format, choose that
     on-visual editor. Expand the **Field
     wells** pane, and then choose the field well
     associated with the number field that you want to
     change.

2. Choose **Format**, and then choose **More
   Formatting Options**.

The **Format data** pane opens. 3. Expand the **Date** section. Choose an existing
date format, or choose **Custom** and specify a
format pattern in the **Custom** section lower down
in the **Format data** pane. If you choose
**Custom** for the **Date**
section, you must also choose **Custom** for the
following **Time** section. The pattern that you
specify in the **Custom** section must include any
date and time formatting that you want.

The default selection is **Custom**, with a
default format pattern of MMM D, YYYY h:mma, for example Sep 20,
2022 5:30pm. 4. Expand the **Time** section. Choose an existing
time format, or choose **Custom** and specify a
format pattern in the **Custom** section lower down
in the **Format data** pane. If you choose
**Custom** for the **Time**
section, you must also choose **Custom** for the
preceding **Date** section. The pattern that you
specify in the **Custom** section must include any
date and time formatting that you want.

The default selection is **Custom**, with a
default format pattern of MMM D, YYYY h:mma, for example Sep 20,
2022 5:30pm. 5. If you chose **Custom** in the
**Date** and **Time**
sections, expand the **Custom** section and specify
the format pattern that you want, using the format pattern syntax
specified in [Moment.js Display Format](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/displaying/ "https://momentjs.com/docs/#/displaying/") in the Moment.js JavaScript
documentation.

###### Note

The time zone related display token `Z` from the
Moment.js library is supported in Quick Suite, but the
`z` token is not.

If you chose something other than **Custom** in
the **Date** and **Time**
sections, **Custom** is populated with the format
pattern that reflects your selections. For example, if you chose Jun
21, 2016 in the **Date** section and 17:00:00pm in
the **Time** section, the
**Custom** section shows the format pattern MMM
D, YYYY H:mm:ssa. 6. (Optional) Expand the **Custom** section and use
**Preview** to verify your specified
format. 7. Expand the **Null values** section and choose
whether to display null values as `null` or as a custom
value. Using `null` is the default.
