# denseRank

The `denseRank` function calculates the rank of a measure or a dimension in
comparison to the specified partitions. It counts each item only once, ignoring
duplicates, and assigns a rank "without holes" so that duplicate values share the same
rank.

## Syntax

The brackets are required. To see which arguments are optional, see the following
descriptions.

```
denseRank
(
  `[ sort_order_field ASC_or_DESC, ... ]`
  ,`[ partition_field, ... ]`
)
```

## Arguments

_sort order field_

One or more aggregated fields, either measures or dimensions or both,
that you want to sort the data by, separated by commas. You can either
specify ascending (`ASC`) or descending
(`DESC`) sort order.

Each field in the list is enclosed in {} (curly braces), if it is more
than one word. The entire list is enclosed in [ ] (square
brackets).

_partition field_

(Optional) One or more dimensions that you want to partition by,
separated by commas.

Each field in the list is enclosed in {} (curly braces), if it is more
than one word. The entire list is enclosed in [ ] (square
brackets).

_calculation level_

(Optional) Specifies the calculation level to use:

- `PRE_FILTER`
  – Prefilter calculations are computed before the dataset
  filters.
- `PRE_AGG` –
  Preaggregate calculations are computed before applying
  aggregations and top and bottom _N_ filters to the visuals.
- `POST_AGG_FILTER`
  – (Default) Table calculations are computed when the
  visuals display.

This value defaults to `POST_AGG_FILTER` when blank. For
more information, see [Using level-aware calculations in
Quick Suite](../../../quicksight/latest/user/level-aware-calculations.md "../../../quicksight/latest/user/level-aware-calculations.md").

## Example

The following example densely ranks `max(Sales)`, based on a descending
sort order, by `State` and `City`. Any cities with the same
`max(Sales)` are assigned the same rank, and the next city is ranked
consecutively after them. For example, if three cities share the same ranking, the
fourth city is ranked as second.

```
denseRank
(
  [max(Sales) DESC],
  [State, City]
)
```

The following example densely ranks `max(Sales)`, based on a descending
sort order, by `State`. Any states with the same `max(Sales)`
are assigned the same rank, and the next is ranked consecutively after them. For
example, if three states share the same ranking, the fourth state is ranked as
second.

```
denseRank
(
  [max(Sales) DESC],
  [State]
)
```
