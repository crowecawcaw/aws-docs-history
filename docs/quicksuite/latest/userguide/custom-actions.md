# Creating and editing custom actions in

Amazon Quick Sight

You create one action for each task that you want to be able to add to a visual.
The actions you create become part of the functionality of each visual or
insight.

The following table defines when to use each type of action.

| Action to perform                                                             | Type of action    |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| Add or customize an interactive filter action, including<br>one-click filters | Filter action     |
| Open another sheet in the same dashboard                                      | Navigation action |
| Open a sheet in a different dashboard in the same<br>AWS account              | URL action        |
| Open a URL (`https`, `http`)                                                  | URL action        |
| Send an email (`mailto`)                                                      | URL action        |

You can set the following attributes and options for a custom action:

- **Action
  name** – This is a descriptive name that you
  choose for the action. By default, actions are named `Action
1`, `Action 2`, and so on. If your
  custom action is activated from a context menu, this name displays in the
  menu when you right-click on a data point.

To make the action name dynamic, you can parameterize it. Use the plus
icon near the action name header to display a list of available variables.
Variables are enclosed in angle brackets `<< >>`.
Parameters are prefixed with a `$` , for example
`<<$parameterName>>`. Field names have no prefix, for
example `<<fieldName>>`.

- **Activation**
  – Available options are **Select** or **Menu
  option**. To use an action, you can _select_ the data point (left-click) or navigate to the
  _menu option_ in the context menu
  (right-click). Navigation actions and URL actions listed in the middle of
  the context menu, just above **Color** options. Actions
  that are activated by menu are also available from the legend on a
  visual.
- **Action
  type** – The type of action that you want.
  Settings that are specific to an action type only display after you choose
  the action type.

      + **Filter action** settings include the following:




      	- **Filter
      	 scope** – The fields to
      	 filter on. To filter on all fields, choose **All
      	 fields**. Otherwise, choose **Select
      	 fields** and then turn off the items you don't
      	 want to target.


      	The default is **All fields**.
      	- **Target
      	 visuals** – The dashboard
      	 widgets to target. To apply the filter to all of them,
      	 choose **All visuals**. Otherwise, choose
      	 **Select visuals** and then turn off
      	 the items you don't want to target. When you apply a filter
      	 action to other visuals, the effect is called
      	 *cascading filters*.


      	The default is **All visuals**.


      	A cascading filter applies all the visuals that are set up
      	 in the **Target visuals** section of a
      	 specific filter action. Amazon Quick Sight initially evaluates your
      	 visuals and preconfigures the settings for you. But you can
      	 change the defaults if you wish to do so. You can set up
      	 multiple cascading filters on multiple visuals in the same
      	 sheet or analysis. When you are using the analysis or
      	 dashboard, you can use multiple cascading filters at the
      	 same time, although you activate each of these one at a
      	 time.


      	A filter action requires at least one target visual,
      	 because a filter action requires a source and a target. To
      	 filter only the current visual, create a regular filter
      	 instead by choosing **Filter** at
      	 left.
      + **Navigation action** settings include the
       following:




      	- **Target
      	 sheet** – The sheet to
      	 target.
      	- **Parameters** – The
      	 parameters to send to the target sheet. Choose the plus icon
      	 to add an existing parameter.
      + **URL action** settings include the following:




      	- **URL** – The URL to open. URL
      	 actions can be deep links into another application. Valid
      	 URL schemes include `https`, `http`,
      	 and `mailto`.
      	- ****+**
      	 (Values)** – (Optional) The parameters
      	 to send to the target URL. Parameter names start with a
      	 `$`. The parameters on both the sending and
      	 the receiving end must match in name and data type.
      	- **Open
      	 in** – Where to open the
      	 URL. You can choose **New browser tab**,
      	 **Same browser tab**, or **New
      	 browser window**.

  Some types of actions enable you to include values from parameters or fields that
  are available in the visual or insight. You can type these in manually or choose
  **+** to select from a list. For the custom action to work,
  every field and parameter it references must be actively in use in the parent
  widget.

analysis.
