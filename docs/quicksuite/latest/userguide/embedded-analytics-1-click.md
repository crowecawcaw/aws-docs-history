| \*_Applies<br>to:_<br>• Enterprise Edition |

You can embed a visual or dashboard in your internal application for registered
users of your Amazon Quick Sight account. You do so using the embed code that you get
when you share the dashboard or from the **Embed visual** menu in
Amazon Quick Sight. You don't have to run the Amazon Quick Sight embedding API to
generate the embed code. You can copy the embed code from Amazon Quick Sight and
paste it in your internal application's HTML code.

When users and groups (or all users on your Amazon Quick Sight account) who have
access to the dashboard that you want to embed or that holds the visual that you
want to embed access your internal application, they're prompted to sign in to the
Amazon Quick Sight account with their credentials. After they are authenticated, they
can access the visual or dashboard on their internal page. If you have single
sign-on enabled, users aren't prompted to sign in again.

Following, you can find descriptions about how to embed a visual or dashboard for
registered users using the visual or dashboard embed code.

## Before you

start

Before you get started, make sure of the following:

- Your internet browser settings contain one of the following to allow
  communication between the popup and the iframe:
  - Native support for the Mozilla Broadcast Channel API. For more
    information, see [Broadcast Channel API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Broadcast_Channel_API "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Broadcast_Channel_API") in the Mozilla
    documentation.
  - IndexedDB support.
  - LocalStorage support.

- Your internet browser's "block all cookies" settings is turned
  off.

## Step 1: Grant access to the

dashboard

For users to access your embedded dashboard, grant them access to view it. You
can grant individual users and groups access to a dashboard, or you can grant
everyone in your account access. Visual permissions are determined at the
dashboard level. To grant access to embedded visuals, grant access to the
dashboard that the visual belongs to. For more information, see [Granting access to a dashboard](share-a-dashboard.md "share-a-dashboard.md").

## Step 2: Put the domain

where you want to embed the visual or dashboard on your allow list

To embed visuals and dashboards in your internal application, make sure that
the domain where you're embedding is allow-listed in your Amazon Quick Sight
account. For more information, see [Allow listing static domains](manage-domains.md#embedding-static "manage-domains.md#embedding-static").

## Step 3: Get the embed

code

Use the following procedure to get the visual or dashboard embed code.

###### To get the dashboard embed code

1. Open the published dashboard in Amazon Quick Sight and choose
   **Share** at upper right. Then choose
   **Share dashboard**.
2. In the **Share dashboard** page that opens, choose
   **Copy embed code** at upper left.

The embed code is copied to your clipboard and is similar to the
following. The `quicksightdomain`
in this example is the URL that you use to access your Amazon Quick Sight
account.

```
<iframe
        width="960"
        height="720"
        src="https://`quicksightdomain`/sn/embed/share/accounts/`accountid`/dashboards/`dashboardid`?directory_alias=account_directory_alias">
    </iframe>
```

###### To get the visual embed code

1. Open the published dashboard in Amazon Quick Sight and choose the
   visual that you want to embed. Then open the on-visual menu at the upper
   right of the visual and choose **Embed visual**.
2. In the **Embed visual** pane that opens, choose
   **Copy code**.

The embed code is copied to your clipboard and is similar to the
following. The `quicksightdomain`
in this example is the URL that you use to access your Amazon Quick Sight
account.

```
<iframe
        width="600"
        height="400"
        src="https://`quicksightdomain`/sn/embed/share/accounts/`111122223333`/dashboards/`DASHBOARDID`/sheets/`SHEETID`>/visuals/`VISUALID`">
    </iframe>
```

## Step 4: Paste the code into

your internal application's HTML page

Use the following procedure to paste the embed code into your internal
application's HTML page

###### To paste the code in your internal application's HTML page

- Open the HTML code for any page where you want to embed the dashboard
  and paste the embed code in.

The following example shows what this might look like for an embedded
dashboard. The `quicksightdomain`
in this example is the URL that you use to access your Amazon Quick Sight
account.

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
    <body>

    <h2>Example.com - Employee Portal</h2>
    <h3>Current shipment stats</h3>
        <iframe
        width="960"
        height="720"
        src="https://`quicksightdomain`/sn/embed/share/accounts/`accountid`/dashboards/`dashboardid`?directory_alias=account_directory_alias">
    </iframe>

    </body>
    </html>
```

The following example shows what this might look like for an embedded
visual. The `quicksightdomain` in
this example is the URL that you use to access your Amazon Quick Sight
account.

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
    <body>

    <h2>Example.com - Employee Portal</h2>
    <h3>Current shipment stats</h3>
        <iframe
        width="600"
        height="400"
        src="https://`quicksightdomain`/sn/embed/share/accounts/`111122223333`/dashboards/`DASHBOARDID`/sheets/`SHEETID`>/visuals/`VISUALID`?directory_alias=account_directory_alias">
    </iframe>

    </body>
    </html>
```

For example, let's say that you want to embed your visual or dashboard in an
internal Google Sites page. You can open the page on Google Sites and paste the
embed code in an embed widget.

If you want to embed your visual or dashboard in an internal Microsoft
SharePoint site, you can create a new page and then paste the embed code in an
Embed web part.
