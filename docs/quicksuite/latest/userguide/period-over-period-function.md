# Period over period

computation

The period over period computation compares values from two different time
periods. For example, you can create a computation to find out how much sales
increased or decreased since the previous time period.

To use this function, you need at least one dimension in the
**Time** field well.

## Parameters

_name_

A unique descriptive name that you assign or change. A name is
assigned if you don't create your own. You can edit this
later.

_Date_

The date dimension that you want to rank.

_Value_

The aggregated measure that the computation is based on.

## Computation

outputs

Each function generates a set of output parameters. You can add these
outputs to the autonarrative to customize what it displays. You can also add
your own custom text.

To locate the output parameters, open the
**Computations** tab on the right, and locate the
computation that you want to use. The names of the computations come from
the name you provide when you create the insight. Choose the output
parameter by clicking on it only once. If you click twice, you add the same
output twice. Items displayed in **bold** can
be used in the narrative.

- `timeField` – From the **Time**
  field well.
  - `**name**`
    – The formatted display name of the field.
  - `**timeGranularity**` – The time
    field granularity (**DAY**,
    **YEAR**, and so on).

- `metricField` – From the
  **Values** field well.
  - `**name**`
    – The formatted display name of the field.
  - `**aggregationFunction**` – The
    aggregation used for the metric (**SUM**,
    **AVG**, and so on).

- `previousMetricValue` – The previous value in
  the metric dimension.
  - `**value**`
    – The raw value.
  - `**formattedValue**` – The value
    formatted by the metric field.
  - `**formattedAbsoluteValue**` –
    The absolute value formatted by the metric field.

- `previousTimeValue` – The previous value in the
  datetime dimension.
  - `**value**`
    – The raw value.
  - `**formattedValue**` – The value
    formatted by the datetime field.

- `currentMetricValue` – The current value in the
  metric dimension.
  - `**value**`
    – The raw value.
  - `**formattedValue**` – The value
    formatted by the metric field.
  - `**formattedAbsoluteValue**` –
    The absolute value formatted by the metric field.

- `currentTimeValue` – The current value in the
  datetime dimension.
  - `**value**`
    – The raw value.
  - `**formattedValue**` – The value
    formatted by the datetime field.

- `percentDifference` – The percent difference
  between the current and previous values of the metric field.
  - `**value**`
    – The raw value of the calculation of the percent
    difference.
  - `**formattedValue**` – The formatted
    value of the percent difference (for example, -42%).
  - `**formattedAbsoluteValue**` –
    The formatted absolute value of the percent difference (for
    example, 42%).

- `absoluteDifference` – The absolute difference
  between the current and previous values of the metric field.
  - `**value**`
    – The raw value of the calculation of the absolute
    difference.
  - `**formattedValue**` – The absolute
    difference formatted by the settings in the metric field's
    format preferences.
  - `**formattedAbsoluteValue**` –
    The absolute value of the difference formatted by the metric
    field.

## Example

###### To create a Period over period computation

1. In the analysis that you want to change, choose **Add
   insight**.
2. For **Computation type**, choose **Period
   over period**, and then choose
   **Select**.
3. In the new insight that you created, add the time dimension and
   value dimension fields that you want to compare. In the screenshot
   below, `Order Date` and `Sales (Sum)` are
   added to the insight. With these two fields selected, Quick Sight
   shows the year to date sales of the latest month and the percentage
   difference compared with the previous month.

menu and choose **Customize narrative**. In the
**Edit narative** window that appears, drag and
drop the fields that you need from the
**Computations** list, and then choose
**Save**.
