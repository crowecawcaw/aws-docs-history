To test whether you can connect to your data source through an existing
Quick Suite VPC connection, use the following procedure.

Before you begin, collect the information you need to connect. If you plan to copy and
paste settings from a file, make sure that it doesn't contain any of the following:
formatting (list bullets or numbers), blank space (spaces, tabs), or invisible "gremlin"
(non-ASCII, null (ASCII 0), or control) characters.

1. On the Amazon Quick Suite start page, choose **Manage data**.
2. On the **Datasets** page, choose **New data
   set**.
3. In the **FROM NEW DATA SOURCES** section of the
   **Create a data set** page, choose a supported data source
   that you want to connect to. For a list of data sources that support VPC, see
   [Identify the data sources to use](../../../quicksight/latest/user/vpc-finding-setup-information.md#vpc-data-sources "../../../quicksight/latest/user/vpc-finding-setup-information.md#vpc-data-sources").

Your data source instance must use the same VPC that you used to create the
VPC connection. Also, the associated security group must be properly configured.
For more information, see [Setting up a VPC to use with
Amazon Quick Suite](../../../quicksight/latest/user/vpc-setup-for-quicksight.md "../../../quicksight/latest/user/vpc-setup-for-quicksight.md"). 4. Enter the connection information for the data source. The fields for the data
source are sometimes displayed in different order depending on which data source
you choose. For more information, see [Creating a data source](../../../quicksight/latest/user/create-a-data-source.md "../../../quicksight/latest/user/create-a-data-source.md").

    * For **Data source name**, enter a descriptive name
     for the new data source. This name appears beside the data source logo
     on a tile on the **Create a data set** page. For
     testing purposes, name it `"VPC test-"` followed by
     the database name or location, whichever is unique.
    * For **Connection Type**, choose the name of the VPC
     connection that has a route to your data source. If the correct VPC is
     missing from the list, ask a Amazon Quick Suite administrator to verify that
     the VPC connection is correct in Amazon Quick Suite. If it looks correct, ask
     a system administrator to verify that the data source and VPC are set up
     for this purpose.
    * The name or other identifier for the server or instance to connect to.
     The descriptors vary depending on which one you're connecting to, but
     it's usually one or more of the following: hostname, IP address, cluster
     ID, instance ID, connector, or site based URL.
    * **Database name** shows the default database for the
     **Instance ID** cluster or instance. If you want to
     use a different database on that cluster or instance, enter its
     name.
    * The name of the collection of data that you want to use.


    The descriptor varies depending on the provider, but it's usually one
     of the following: database, warehouse, or catalog. In this topic, we use
     the word "database" as a generic term.
    * For **Credentials**, enter a username and password to
     use for everyone who connects from Amazon Quick Suite using this data source.
     The username must have permissions to do the following:




    	+ Access the target database.
    	+ Read (perform a `SELECT` statement on) all of the
    	 tables that you want to use in that database.

5. Choose **Validate connection** to verify your connection
   information is correct. If your connection doesn't validate, correct the
   connection information and try again. If the information looks correct but
   doesn't validate, do one or all of the following:
   - Contact your data source administrator to verify your connection
     settings.
   - Contact your Amazon Quick Suite administrator to verify the settings in the
     Amazon Quick Suite VPC connection.
   - Contact your AWS administrator to verify that the VPC is correctly
     configured for use with Amazon Quick Suite.

6. After the connection validates, choose **Create data source**
   to save the connection profile. Or, choose **Cancel** if you
   don't need to save it (recommended) after testing is complete.
