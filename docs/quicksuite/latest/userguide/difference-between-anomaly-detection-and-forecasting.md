# What's the

difference between anomaly detection and forecasting?

Anomaly detection identifies outliers and their contributing drivers to answer the
question "What happened that doesn't usually happen?" Forecasting answers
the question "If everything continues to happen as expected, what happens in
the future?" The math that allows forecasting also enables us to ask "If a
few things change, what happens then?"

Both anomaly detection and forecasting begin by examining the current known data
points. Amazon Quick Sight anomaly detection begins with what is known so it can establish what
is outside the known set, and identify those data points as anomalous (outliers).
Amazon Quick Sight forecasting excludes the anomalous data points, and sticks with the known
pattern. Forecasting focuses on the established pattern of data distribution. In
contrast, anomaly detection focuses on the data points that deviate from what is
expected. Each method approaches decision-making from a different direction.
