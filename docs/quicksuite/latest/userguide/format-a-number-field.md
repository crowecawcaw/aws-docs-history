# Format a number field

When you format a number field, you can choose the decimal place and
thousand separator format from a list of common options. Or you can open the
**Format Data** pane and manually format the field.
Manually formatting the field enables you to choose which separators to use
and the number of decimal places to show. It also enables you to choose
which units to use, and how to display negative numbers.

Changing a field format changes it for all visuals in the analysis, but
does not change it in the underlying dataset.

If you want to format a number field by choosing from a list of common
options, you can access such a list from the **Field list**
pane, an on-visual editor, or a visual field well.

**To change a number field's format by choosing a list
option:**

- Choose one of the following options:
  - In the **Field list** pane, choose the
    selector icon to the right of the number field that you want
    to format.
  - On any visual that contains an on-visual editor associated
    with the number field that you want to format, choose that
    on-visual editor. Expand the **Field
    wells** pane, and then choose the field well
    associated with the number field that you want to
    change.

- Choose **Format**, and then choose the format
  that you want. The following quick formatting options are offered
  for number fields:

      + Use commas to separate groups of thousands and use a
       decimal point to show the fractional part of the number, for
       example 1,234.56.
      + Use a decimal point to show the fractional part of the
       number, for example 1234.56.
      + Show the number as an integer and use commas to separate
       groups of thousands, for example 1,234.
      + Show the number as an integer, for example 1234.

  **To manually change a number field's
  format:**

1. Choose one of the following options:
   - In the **Field list** pane, choose the
     selector icon to the right of the number field that you want
     to format.
   - On any visual that contains an on-visual editor associated
     with the number field that you want to format, choose that
     on-visual editor. Expand the **Field
     wells** pane, and then choose the field well
     associated with the number field that you want to
     change.

2. Choose **Format**, and then choose **More
   Formatting Options**.

The **Format data** pane opens. 3. Expand the **Separators** section and choose from
the following options:

    * Under **Decimal**, choose a dot or a
     comma for the decimal separator. A dot is the default. If
     you choose a comma instead, use a dot or a space as the
     thousands separator.
    * Under **Thousands**, select or clear
     **Enabled** to indicate whether you
     want to use a thousands separator.
     **Enabled** is selected by
     default.
    * If you are using a thousands separator, choose whether to
     use a comma, dot, or space for the separator. A comma is the
     default. If you choose a dot instead, use a comma as the
     decimal separator.

4.  Expand the **Decimal Places** section and choose
    from the following options:
    - Choose **Auto** to have Amazon Quick Suite
      automatically determine the appropriate number of decimal
      places, or choose **Custom** to specify a
      number of decimal places. **Auto** is the
      default.
    - If you chose **Custom**, enter the number
      of decimal places to use. Field values are rounded to the
      decimal places specified. For example, if you specify two
      decimal places, the value 6.728 is rounded to 6.73.

5.  Expand the **Units** section and choose from the
    following options:
    - Choose the unit to use. Choosing a unit adds the
      appropriate suffix to the number value. For example, if you
      choose **Thousands**, a field value of 1234
      displays as 1.234K.

    The unit options are as follows:

        + No unit suffix. This is the default.
        + Thousands (K)
        + Millions (M)
        + Billions (B)
        + Trillions (T)

    - If you want to use a custom prefix or suffix, specify it
      in the **Prefix** or
      **Suffix** box. You can specify both.
      You can also specify a custom prefix in addition to the
      suffix added by selecting a unit.

6.  Expand the **Negatives** section and choose
    whether to display a negative value by using a minus sign or by
    enclosing it in parentheses. Using a minus sign is the
    default.
7.  Expand the **Null values** section and choose
    whether to display null values as `null` or as a custom
    value. Using `null` is the default.

###### Note

When using a table or pivot table, null values only display
for fields that are placed in the **Rows**,
**Columns**, or **Group
by** field wells. Null values for fields in the
**Values** field well appear empty in the
table or pivot table.
