# Adding drill-downs to visual data in

Quick Sight

All visual types except pivot tables offer the ability to create a hierarchy of fields
for a visual element. The hierarchy lets you drill down to see data at different levels
of the hierarchy. For example, you can associate the country, state, and city fields
with the x-axis on a bar chart. Then, you can drill down or up to see data at each of
those levels. As you drill down each level, the data displayed is refined by the value
in the field you drill down on. For example, if you drill down on the state of
California, you see data on all of the cities in California.

The field wells you can use to create drill-downs varies by visual type. Refer to the
topic on each visual type to learn more about its drill-down support.

Drill-down functionality is added automatically for dates when you associate a date
field with the drill-down field well of a visual. In this case, you can always drill up
and down through the levels of date granularity. Drill-down functionality is also added
automatically for geospatial groupings, after you define these in the dataset.

Use the following table to identify the field wells/on-visual editors that support
drill-down for each visual type.

| Visual type                 | Field well or on-visual editor           |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Bar charts (all horizontal) | **Y axis\*<br>• and<br>**Group/Color\*\* |
| Bar charts (all vertical)   | **X axis\*<br>• and<br>**Group/Color\*\* |
| Combo charts (all)          | **X axis\*<br>• and<br>**Group/Color\*\* |
| Geospatial charts           | **Geospatial\*<br>• and<br>**Color\*\*   |
| Heat map                    | **Rows\*<br>• and **Columns\*\*          |
| KPIs                        | **Trend Group**                          |
| Line charts (all)           | **X axis\*<br>• and **Color\*\*          |
| Pie chart                   | **Group/Color**                          |
| Scatter plot                | **Group/Color**                          |
| Tree map                    | **Group by**                             |

###### Important

Drill-downs are not suppoted for tables or pivot tables.

## Adding a drill-down

Use the following procedure to add drill-down levels to a visual.

###### To add drill-down levels to a visual

1. On the analysis page, choose the visual that you want to add drill-downs
   to.
2. Drag a field item into a **Field well**.
3. If your dataset has a defined hierarchy, you can drag the entire hierarchy
   into the field well as one. An example is geospatial or coordinate data. In
   this case, you don't need to follow the remaining steps.

If you don't have a predefined hierarchy, you can create one in your
analysis, as described in the remaining steps. 4. Drag a field that you want to use in the drill-down hierarchy to an
appropriate field well, depending on the visual type. Make sure that the
label for the dragged field says **Add drill-down layer**.
Position the dragged field above or below the existing field based on where
you want it to be in the hierarchy you're creating. 5. Continue until you have added all of the levels of hierarchy that you
want. To remove a field from the hierarchy, choose the field, and then
choose **Remove**. 6. To drill down or up to see data at a different level of the hierarchy,
choose an element on the visual (like a line or bar), and then choose
**Drill down to <lower level>** or
**Drill up to <higher level>**. In this example,
from the `car-make` level you can drill down to
`car-model` to see data at that level. If you drill down to
`car-model` from the **Ford**
`car-make`, you see only `car-model`s in that
car-make.

After you drill down to the `car-model` level, you can then
drill down further to see `make-year` data, or go back up to
`car-make`. If you drill down to `make-year` from
the bar representing **Ranger**, you see only years for
that model of car.
