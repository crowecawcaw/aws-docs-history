# Using contribution

analysis for key drivers

Amazon Quick Sight can identify the dimensions (categories) that contribute to outliers
in measures (metrics) between two points in time. The key driver that
contributes to an outlier helps you to answer the question: What happened to
cause this anomaly?

If you are already using anomaly detection without contribution analysis, you
can enable the existing ML insight to find key drivers. Use the following
procedure to add contribution analysis and identify the key drivers behind
outliers. Your insight for anomaly detection needs to include a time field and
at least one aggregated metric (SUM, AVERAGE, or COUNT). You can include
multiple categories (dimension fields) if you wish, but you can also run
contribution analysis without specifying any category or dimension field.

You can also use this procedure to change or remove fields as key drivers in
your anomaly detection.

###### To add contribution analysis to identify key drivers

1. Open your analysis and locate an existing ML insight for anomaly
   detection. Select the insight widget to highlight it.
2. Choose **Menu Options**
   (**…**) from the menu on the visual.
3. Choose **Configure anomaly** to edit the
   settings.
4. The **Contribution analysis (optional)** setting
   allows Amazon Quick Sight to analyze the key drivers when an outlier (anomaly) is
   detected. For example, Amazon Quick Sight can show you the top customers that
   contributed to a spike in sales in the US for home improvement products.
   You can add up to four dimensions from your dataset, including
   dimensions that you didn't add to the field wells of this insight
   widget.

To view a list of dimensions available for contribution analysis,
choose **Select fields**.

If you want to change the fields you're using as key drivers, change
the fields that are enabled in this list. If you disable all of them,
Quick Sight won't perform any contribution analysis in this
insight. 5. To save your changes, scroll to the bottom of the configuration
options, and choose **Save**. To exit without saving,
choose **Cancel**. To completely remove these settings,
choose **Delete**.
