# Maximum computation

The maximum computation finds the maximum dimension by value. For example, you
can create a computation to find the month with the highest revenue.

To use this function, you need at least one dimension in the
**Time** field well.

## Parameters

_name_

A unique descriptive name that you assign or change. A name is
assigned if you don't create your own. You can edit this
later.

_Date_

The date dimension that you want to rank.

_Value_

The aggregated measure that the computation is based
on.

## Computation outputs

Each function generates a set of output parameters. You can add these
outputs to the autonarrative to customize what it displays. You can also add
your own custom text.

To locate the output parameters, open the
**Computations** tab on the right, and locate the
computation that you want to use. The names of the computations come from
the name you provide when you create the insight. Choose the output
parameter by clicking on it only once. If you click twice, you add the same
output twice. Items displayed in **bold** can
be used in the narrative.

###### Note

These are the same output parameters as the ones that are returned by
the minimum computation.

- `timeField` – From the **Time**
  field well.
  - `**name**`
    – The formatted display name of the field.
  - `**timeGranularity**` – The time
    field granularity (**DAY**,
    **YEAR**, and so on).

- `metricField` – From the
  **Values** field well.
  - `**name**`
    – The formatted display name of the field.
  - `**aggregationFunction**` – The
    aggregation used for the metric (**SUM**,
    **AVG**, and so on).

- `metricValue` – The value in the metric
  dimension.
  - `**value**`
    – The raw value.
  - `**formattedValue**` – The value
    formatted by the metric field.
  - `**formattedAbsoluteValue**` –
    The absolute value formatted by the metric field.

- `timeValue` – The value in the datetime
  dimension.
  - `**value**`
    – The raw value.
  - `**formattedValue**` – The value
    formatted by the datetime field.
