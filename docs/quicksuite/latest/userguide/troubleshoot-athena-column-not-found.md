# Column not found when using

Athena with Amazon Quick Sight

You can receive a "`column not found`" error if the columns in an
analysis are missing from the Athena data source.

In Amazon Quick Sight, open your analysis. On the **Visualize** tab, choose
**Choose dataset**, **Edit analysis data
sets**.

On the **Data sets in this analysis** screen, choose
**Edit** near your dataset to refresh the dataset. Amazon Quick Sight
caches the schema for two minutes. So it can take two minutes before the latest
changes display.

To investigate how the column was lost in the first place, you can go to the Athena
console ([https://console.aws.amazon.com/athena/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/athena/home "https://console.aws.amazon.com/athena/home")) and check the query history to find queries that edited
the table.

If this error happened when you were editing a custom SQL query in preview, verify
that the name of the column in the query, and check for any other syntax errors. For
example, check that the column name isn't enclosed in single quotation marks, which
are reserved for strings.

If you still have the issue, verify that your tables, columns, and queries comply
with Athena requirements. For more information, see [Names
for Tables, Databases, and Columns](../../../athena/latest/ug/tables-databases-columns-names.md "../../../athena/latest/ug/tables-databases-columns-names.md") and [Troubleshooting](../../../athena/latest/ug/troubleshooting.md "../../../athena/latest/ug/troubleshooting.md") in the _Athena User
Guide_.
