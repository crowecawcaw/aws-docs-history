    you want to generate a PDF report for.

         you choose.
        * **Weekly** – Repeats each week on the same
         day or days at the time that you choose. You can also use this
         option to send reports in weekly intervals, such as every other week
         or every three weeks.
        * **Monthly** – Repeats each month on the
         same day of the month at the time that you choose. You can also use

        * **Yearly** – Repeats each year on the same
         day of the month or months selected at the time that you choose. You
         can also use this option to send reports on specific days or sets of
         days in selected months. For example, you can configure a report to
         be sent on the first Monday of January, March, and September, or on
         July 14th, or on the second day of February, April, and June each
         year.
