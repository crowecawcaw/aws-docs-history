# Reverting datasets back to previous published

versions

When you save and publish changes to a dataset in Amazon Quick Sight, a new version of the
dataset is created. At any time, you can see a list of all the previous published
versions of that dataset. You can also preview a specific version in that history, or
even revert the dataset back to a previous version, if needed.

The following limitations apply to dataset versioning:

- Only the most recent 1,000 versions of a dataset are shown in the publishing
  history, and are available for versioning.
- After you exceed 1,000 published versions, the oldest versions are
  automatically removed from the publishing history, and the dataset can no longer
  be reverted back to them.
  Use the following procedure to revert a dataset to a previous published
  version.

###### To revert a dataset to a previous published version

1. From the Quick Suite start page, choose
   **Data**.
2. On the **Data** page, choose a dataset, and then choose
   **Edit dataset** at upper right.

For more information about editing datasets, see [Editing datasets](edit-a-data-set.md "edit-a-data-set.md"). 3. On the dataset preparation page that opens, choose the
**Manage** icon in the blue toolbar at upper right, and
then choose **Publishing history**.

A list of previous published versions appears at right. 4. In the **Publishing history** pane, find the version that you
want and choose **Revert**.

To preview the version before reverting, choose
**Preview**.

The dataset is reverted and a confirmation message appears. The
**Publishing history** pane also updates to show the active
version of the dataset.

## Troubleshooting reverting

versions

Sometimes, the dataset can't be reverted to a specific version for one the
following reasons:

- The dataset uses one or more data sources that were deleted.

If this error occurs, you can't revert the dataset to a previous
version.

- Reverting would make a calculated field not valid.

If this error occurs, you can edit or remove the calculated field, and
then save the dataset. Doing this creates a new version of the
dataset.

- One or more columns are missing in the data source.

If this error occurs, Quick Sight shows the latest schema from the data
source in the preview to reconcile differences between versions. Any
calculated field, field name, field type, and filter changes shown in the
schema preview are from the version that you want to revert to. You can save
this reconciled schema as a new version of the dataset. Or you can return to
the active (latest) version by choosing **Preview** on the
top (latest) version in the publishing history.
