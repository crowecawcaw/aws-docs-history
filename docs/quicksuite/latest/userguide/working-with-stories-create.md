# Creating a data story with Generative

BI;

Use the following procedure to create a data story with Generative BI.

###### To create a data story

1. Open the [Quick Suite console](https://quicksight.aws.amazon.com/ "https://quicksight.aws.amazon.com/").
2. At left, choose **Stories**.
3. On the **Data stories** page, choose **New Data
   Story**.
4. In the **Story** screen that appears, navigate to the
   **Build story** modal and input a data story prompt that
   you would like to generate. For the best results, don't phrase the prompt
   like a question. Instead, type the data story that you want Quick Sight to
   build. For example, say you want to create a data story about the most commonly
   performed medical procedures by region. A good prompt for this use case is
   "Build a data story about most commonly performed procedures by physicians in
   various regions. Also, show the specialties where patients are admitted the
   most. Recommend where we need to staff more physicians by specialty, and include
   at least four points of supporting data."

You can optionally skip this step and manually create your data story. If you
choose to forego entering a prompt, you still need to add a visual to the data
story. 5. Under **Select visuals**, choose
**Add**. 6. Choose the dashboard that contains the visuals that you want to use, and then
choose the visuals that you want. You can add up to 20 visuals to a data
story.

If you don't see the dashboard that you want to use, use the **Find
your dashboards** search bar at the top of the modal.

You can choose visuals from any number of dashboards that you have sharing
permissions to. Visuals that show a **Restricted** badge have
permissions that restrict them from being added to a data story. A visual might
be restricted for one of the following reasons:

    * The dataset is connected to a data source that uses trusted identity
     propagation with Amazon Redshift.
    * The dataset is located inside of a restricted folder.

7. (Optional) Use the **Select documents** section to upload up
   to 5 documents to be used in the data story. Each document can't exceed
   10MB. These documents are only used to generate the data story and are not
   stored in Quick Sight. The following image shows the **Select
   documents** section of the **Build story**
   screen.
8. (Optional) If your Quick Suite account is connected to an Amazon Q Business
   application, check the **Use insights from Amazon Q Business**
   checkbox to augment your data story with unstructured data sources from
   Amazon Q Business. For more information about connecting a Quick Suite account to
   a Amazon Q Business application, see [Augmenting Amazon Quick Sight insights with
   Amazon Q Business](generative-bi-q-business.md "generative-bi-q-business.md").
9. Choose **Build**.
   After the data story generates, review the data story and choose from the following
   options:

- **Keep** – Saves the generated content to the canvas.
  When you choose this option, the **Build story** modal closes
  and you can start editing your data story.
- **Try again** – Allows users to edit the prompt and
  generate a new data story.
- **Discard** – Deletes the generated data story.
