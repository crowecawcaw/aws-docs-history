# Datasets using S3 files in

another AWS account

Use this section to learn how to set up security so you can use Quick Sight to
access Amazon S3 files in another AWS account.

For you to access files in another account, the owner of the other account must
first set Amazon S3 to grant you permissions to read the file. Then, in Quick Sight, you
must set up access to the buckets that were shared with you. After both of these
steps are finished, you can use a manifest to create a dataset.

###### Note

To access files that are shared with the public, you don't need to set
up any special security. However, you still need a manifest file.

## Setting up Amazon S3 to allow access from a different Quick Suite

account

Use this section to learn how to set permissions in Amazon S3 files so they can be
accessed by Quick Sight in another AWS account.

For information on accessing another account's Amazon S3 files from your
Quick Sight account, see [Setting
up Quick Sight to access Amazon S3 files in another AWS account](#setup-quicksight-to-access-S3-in-a-different-account "#setup-quicksight-to-access-S3-in-a-different-account"). For more
information about S3 permissions, see [Managing
access permissions to your Amazon S3 resources](../../../AmazonS3/latest/dev/s3-access-control.md "../../../AmazonS3/latest/dev/s3-access-control.md") and [How do I set permissions on an object?](../../../AmazonS3/latest/user-guide/set-object-permissions.md "../../../AmazonS3/latest/user-guide/set-object-permissions.md")

You can use the following procedure to set this access from the S3 console. Or
you can grant permissions by using the AWS CLI or by writing a script. If you have
a lot of files to share, you can instead create an S3 bucket policy on the
`s3:GetObject` action. To use a bucket policy, add it to the
bucket permissions, not to the file permissions. For information on bucket
policies, see [Bucket policy examples](../../../AmazonS3/latest/dev/example-bucket-policies.md "../../../AmazonS3/latest/dev/example-bucket-policies.md") in the _Amazon S3
Developer Guide._

###### To set access from a different Quick Suite account from the S3

console

1. Get the email address of the AWS account email that you want to
   share with. Or you can get and use the canonical user ID. For more
   information on canonical user IDs, see [AWS
   account identifiers](../../../general/latest/gr/acct-identifiers.md "../../../general/latest/gr/acct-identifiers.md") in the _AWS
   General Reference._
2. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon S3 console at
   [https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/ "https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/").
3. Find the Amazon S3 bucket that you want to share with Quick Sight. Choose
   **Permissions**.
4. Choose **Add Account**, and then enter an email
   address, or paste in a canonical user ID, for the AWS account that you
   want to share with. This email address should be the primary one for the
   AWS account.
5. Choose **Yes** for both **Read bucket
   permissions** and **List objects**.

Choose **Save** to confirm. 6. Find the file that you want to share, and open the file's permission
settings. 7. Enter an email address or the canonical user ID for the AWS account
that you want to share with. This email address should be the primary
one for the AWS account. 8. Enable **Read object** permissions for each file that
Quick Sight needs access to. 9. Notify the Quick Suite user that the files are now available for
use.

## Setting

up Quick Sight to access Amazon S3 files in another AWS account

Use this section to learn how to set up Quick Sight so you can access Amazon S3
files in another AWS account. For information on allowing someone else to
access your Amazon S3 files from their Quick Suite account, see [Setting up Amazon S3 to allow access from a different Quick Suite
account](#setup-S3-to-allow-access-from-a-different-quicksight-account "#setup-S3-to-allow-access-from-a-different-quicksight-account").

Use the following procedure to access another account's Amazon S3 files from
Quick Sight. Before you can use this procedure, the users in the other AWS
account must share the files in their Amazon S3 bucket with you.

###### To access another account's Amazon S3 files from Quick Sight

1. Verify that the user or users in the other AWS account gave your
   account read and write permission to the S3 bucket in question.
2. Choose your profile icon, and then choose **Manage
   Quick Sight**.
3. Choose **Security & permissions**.
4. Under **Quick Sight access to AWS services**,
   choose **Manage**.
5. Choose **Select S3 buckets**.
6. On the **Select Amazon S3 buckets** screen, choose
   the **S3 buckets you can access across AWS**
   tab.

The default tab is named **S3 buckets linked to Quick Sight
account**. It shows all the buckets your Quick Suite
account has access to. 7. Do one of the following:

    * To add all the buckets that you have permission to use, choose
     **Choose accessible buckets from other AWS
     accounts**.
    * If you have one or more Amazon S3 buckets that you want to add,
     enter their names. Each must exactly match the unique name of
     the Amazon S3 bucket.


    If you don't have the appropriate permissions, you see the
     error message "We can't connect to this S3 bucket. Make sure
     that any S3 buckets you specify are associated with the AWS
     account used to create this Quick Suite account." This
     error message appears if you don't have either account
     permissions or Quick Sight permissions.

###### Note

To use Amazon Athena, Quick Sight needs to access the Amazon S3 buckets
that Athena uses.

You can add them here one by one, or use the **Choose
accessible buckets from other AWS accounts**
option. 8. Choose **Select buckets** to confirm your selection. 9. Create a new dataset based on Amazon S3, and upload your manifest file. For
more information Amazon S3 datasets, see [Creating a dataset using Amazon S3 files](create-a-data-set-s3.md "create-a-data-set-s3.md").
