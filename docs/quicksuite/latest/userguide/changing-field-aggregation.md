# Changing field aggregation

You can apply functions to fields to display aggregate information, like the sum
of the sales for a given product. You can apply an aggregate function by using the
options in either an on-visual editor or a field well. The following aggregate
functions are available in Amazon Quick Suite:

- Average – Calculates the average value for the selected
  field.
- Count – Provides a count of the number of records containing the
  selected measure for a given dimension. An example is a count of Order ID by
  State.
- Distinct Count – Provides a count of how many different values are
  in the selected measure, for the selected dimension or dimensions. An
  example is a count of Product by Region. A simple count can show how many
  products are sold for each region. A distinct count can show how many
  different products are sold for each region. You might have sold 2,000
  items, but only two different types of items.
- Max – Calculates the maximum value for the selected field.
- Min – Calculates the minimum value for the selected field.
- Median – Calculates the median value of the specified measure,
  grouped by the chosen dimension or dimensions.
- Sum – Totals all of the values for the selected field.
- Standard Deviation – Calculates the standard deviation of the set
  of numbers in the specified measure, grouped by the chosen dimension or
  dimensions, based on a sample or on a biased population.
- Variance – Calculates the variance of the set of numbers in the
  specified measure, grouped by the chosen dimension or dimensions, based on a
  sample or on a biased population.
- Percentile – Computes the *n*th
  percentile of the specified measure, grouped by the chosen dimension or
  dimensions.
  All aggregate functions can be applied to numeric fields.
  _Count_ is automatically applied to a dimension if you choose
  to use it in a field well that expects a measure. If you have used a dimension in
  that way, you can also change the aggregate function applied to it. You can't
  apply aggregate functions to fields in dimension field wells.

The visual elements that support aggregated fields varies by visual type.
