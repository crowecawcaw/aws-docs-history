# Using SQL to customize data

When you create a dataset or prepare your data for use in an analysis, you can
customize the data in the query editor.

The query editor is made up of multiple components, as follows:

- **Query mode** – At the
  top left, you can choose between direct query or SPICE query
  modes:
  - **Direct query** – To run the SELECT statement
    directly against the database
  - **SPICE** – To run the SELECT
    statement against data that was previously stored in memory

- **Fields** – Use this
  section to disable fields you want to remove from the final dataset. You can add
  calculated fields in this section, and augment your data with SageMaker AI
- **Query archive** – Use
  this section to find previous version of your SQL queries.
- **Filters** – Use this
  section to add, edit, or remove filters.
- **Schema explorer** –
  This section only appears while you are editing SQL. You can use it to explore
  your schemas, tables, fields, and data types.
- **SQL editor** – Use
  this to edit your SQL. The SQL editor, which offers syntax highlighting, basic
  autocomplete, autoindent, and line numbering. You can specify a SQL query only
  for datasets that come from data sources compatible with SQL. Your SQL must
  conform to the target database requirements regarding syntax, capitalization,
  command termination, and so on. If you prefer, you can instead paste SQL from
  another editor.
- **Data workspace** –
  When the SQL editor is closed, the data workspace displays at top right with a
  grid background. Here you can see a graphical representation of your data
  objects, including queries, tables, files, and joins created in the join
  editor.

To view details about each table, use the data source options menu and choose
**Table details** or **Edit SQL Query**.
Details display for table name and alias, schema, data source name, and data
source type. For upload settings on a file, choose **Configure upload
settings** from the data source options menu to view or change the
following settings:

    + Format – the file format, CSV, CUSTOM, CLF, and so on
    + The starting row – the row to start with
    + The text qualifier – double quote or single quote
    + Header – indicates if the file includes a header row

- **Preview rows** – A
  preview of the sampled rows appear at bottom right when the join configuration
  editor isn't in use.
- **Join configuration** editor
  – The join editor opens when you have more than one data object in the
  data workspace. To edit a join, you select the join icon between two tables (or
  files). Choose a join type and the fields to join on, by using the join
  configuration panel at the bottom of the screen. Then choose
  **Apply** to create the join. You must complete all joins
  before you can save your work.
  To add more queries, tables, or files, use the **Add data** option
  above the workspace.

## Creating a basic SQL query

Use the following procedure to connect to a data source by using a custom SQL
query.

###### To create a basic SQL query

1. Create a new data source and validate the connection.
2. Fill in the options necessary to connection, however you don't need to
   select a schema or a table.
3. Choose **Use custom SQL**.
4. (Optional) You can enter your query in the SQL editor, or continue on to
   the next step to use the full-screen version. To enter it now, create a name
   for the query. Then type or paste a SQL query into the editor. The SQL
   editor offers syntax highlighting, basic autocomplete, autoindent, and line
   numbering.

(Optional) Choose **Confirm query** to validate it and
view settings for direct query, SPICE memory, and SageMaker AI
settings. 5. Choose **Edit/Preview data**. The full query editor
appears with the SQL editor displayed. The query is processed and a sample
of the query results displays in the data preview pane. You can make changes
to the SQL and confirm them by choosing **Apply**. When you
are done with the SQL, choose **Close** to continue. 6. At the top, enter a name for the dataset. Then choose **Save
& visualize**.

### Modifying existing queries

###### To update a SQL query

1. Open the dataset that you want to work with.
2. In the workspace with the grid, locate the box-shaped object that
   represents the existing query.
3. Open the options menu on the query object and choose **Edit
   SQL query**. If this option doesn't appear in the list, the
   query object isn't based on SQL.

To view previous versions of queries, open the **Query
archive** at left.
