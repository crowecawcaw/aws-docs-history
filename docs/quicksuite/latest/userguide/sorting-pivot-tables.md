# Sorting pivot tables in

Quick Suite

In Amazon Quick Suite, you can sort values in a pivot table by fields in the
**Rows** and **Columns** field wells or
quickly by column headers in the pivot table. In pivot tables, you can sort rows and
columns independently of each other in alphabetical order, or by a measure.

###### Note

You can't run Total, Difference, and Percent Difference table calculations
when a pivot table is being sorted by a measure. For more information about
using table calculations in pivot tables, see [Using table calculations in pivot
tables](working-with-calculations.md "working-with-calculations.md").

## Understanding sorting in

pivot tables

When you have multiple panes in a pivot table, sorting is applied to each pane
independently. For example, the `Segment` column in the pivot table
on the left is being sorted in ascending order by `Cost`. Given that
there are multiple panes, the sort starts over for each pane and the rows within
each pane (for `Segment`) are ordered by lowest to highest cost. The
table on the right has the same sort applied, but the sort is being applied
across the entire table, as shown following.

When you apply multiple sorts to a pivot table, sorting is applied from the
outside dimension to the inside dimension. Consider the following example image
of a pivot table. The `Customer Region` column is sorted by
`Cost` in descending order (as shown in orange). The
`Channel` column is sorted by Revenue Goal in ascending order (as
shown in blue).

## Sorting pivot tables using row or

column headers

Use the following procedure to sort a pivot table using Row or Column
headers.

###### To sort values in a tabular pivot table using table headers

1. In a tabular pivot table chart, choose the header that you want to
   sort.
2. For **Sort by**, choose a field to sort by and a sort
   order.

You can sort dimension fields alphabetically a–z or z–a,
or you can sort them by a measure in ascending or descending
order.

## Sorting pivot tables using value

headers

Use the following procedure to sort a pivot table using value headers.

###### To sort a pivot table using value headers

1. In a pivot table chart, choose the value header that you want to
   sort.
2. Choose **Ascending** or
   **Descending**.

Sorting by value headers in a pivot table also works on
subtotals.

## Sorting tabular pivot tables

using the field wells

Use the following procedure to sort values in a tabular pivot table using the
field wells.

###### To sort values in a tabular pivot table using the field wells

1. On the analysis page, choose the tabular pivot table that you want to
   sort.
2. Expand the **Field wells**.
3. In the **Rows** or **Columns** field
   well, choose the field that you want to sort, and then choose how you
   want to sort the field for **Sort by**.

You can sort dimension fields in the **Rows** or
**Columns** field wells alphabetically from
a–z or z–a, or you can sort them by a measure in ascending
or descending order. You also have the option to collapse all or expand
all rows or columns for the field you choose in the field well. You can
also remove the field, or to replace it with another field.

    * To sort a dimension field alphabetically, hover your cursor
     over the field in the **Rows** or
     **Columns** field well, and then choose the
     a–z or z–a sort icon.



    ![Image of a field in the Rows field well with the sort by field and alphabetical sort icons indicated in red squares.](../images/sorting-pivot-tables1.png)
    * To sort a dimension field by a measure, hover your cursor over
     the field in the **Rows** or
     **Columns** field well. Then choose a
     measure from the list, and then choose the ascending or
     descending sort icon.



    ![Image of a field in the Rows field well with the sort by field and sort icons indicated in red squares.](../images/sorting-pivot-tables4.png)

Or, if you want more control over how the sort is applied to the pivot table,
customize the sort options.

###### To create a sort using the **sort options**

1. On the analysis page, choose the pivot table that you want to
   sort.
2. Expand **Field wells**.
3. Choose the field that you want to sort in the
   **Rows** or **Columns** field
   well, and then choose **Sort options**.
4. In the **Sort options** pane that opens at left,
   specify the following options:
   1. For **Sort by**, choose a field from the
      drop-down list.
   2. For **Aggregation**, choose an aggregation
      from the list.
   3. For **Sort order**, select
      **Ascending** or
      **Descending**.
   4. Choose **Apply**.

## Sorting hierarchy pivot tables

using the field wells

For tabular pivot tables, each field in the **Rows** field
well has a separate title cell. For hierarchy pivot tables, all row fields are
displayed in a single column. To sort, collapse, and expand these row fields,
select the **Rows** label to open the **Combined row
fields** menu and choose the option that you want. Each field in a
hierarchy pivot table can be individually sorted from the **Combined row
fields** menu.

More advanced formatting options such as **Hide** and
**Remove** are available from the field well menus.
