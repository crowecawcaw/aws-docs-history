You can embed a visual or dashboard in public sites using the embed code that you
get when you share the visual or dashboard in Amazon Quick Sight. You can also turn
on public sharing by using the Amazon Quick Sight console and automatically grant
access to a shared visual or dashboard to anyone on the internet.

Following, you can find how to turn on public sharing for a visual or dashboard
and embed the visual or dashboard for anyone on the internet to see. In both cases,
you do this by using the 1-click embed code.

## Before you

start

Before you get started, make sure of the following:

- Your internet browser settings contain one of the following to allow
  communication between the popup and the iframe that sharing uses:
  - Native support for the Mozilla Broadcast Channel API. For more
    information, see [Broadcast Channel API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Broadcast_Channel_API "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Broadcast_Channel_API") in the Mozilla
    documentation.
  - IndexedDB support.
  - LocalStorage support.

- Your internet browser's "block all cookies" settings is turned
  off.

## Step 1: Turn on public

access for the dashboard

For anyone on the internet to access your embedded visual or dashboard, first
turn on public access for the dashboard. Visual permissions are determined at
the dashboard level. To grant access to embedded visuals, grant access to the
dashboard that the visual belongs to. For more information, see [Granting anyone on the
internet access to an Amazon Quick Sight dashboard](share-a-dashboard-grant-access-anyone.md "share-a-dashboard-grant-access-anyone.md").

## Step 2: Put the domain where

you want to embed the visual or dashboard on your allow list

To embed visuals and dashboards in a public application, wiki, or portal, make
sure that the domain where you're embedding it is on the allow list for your
Amazon Quick Sight account.

## Step 3: Get the embed

code

Use the following procedure to get the visual or dashboard embed code.

###### To get the dashboard embed code

1. Open the published dashboard in Amazon Quick Sight and choose
   **Share** at upper right. Then choose
   **Share dashboard**.
2. In the **Share dashboard** page that opens, choose
   **Copy embed code** at upper left.

The embed code is copied to your clipboard and is similar to the
following. The `quicksightdomain`
in this example is the URL that you use to access your Amazon Quick Sight
account.

```
<iframe
        width="960"
        height="720"
        src="https://`quicksightdomain`/sn/
            embed/share/accounts/`accountid`/dashboards/`dashboardid`">
    </iframe>
```

###### To get the visual embed code

1. Open the published dashboard in Amazon Quick Sight and choose the
   visual that you want to embed. Then open the on-visual menu in the top
   right corner of the visual and choose **Embed
   visual**.
2. In the **Embed visual** pane that opens, choose
   **Copy code**.

The embed code is copied to your clipboard and is similar to the
following. The `quicksightdomain`
in this example is the URL that you use to access your Amazon Quick Sight
account.

```
<iframe
        width="600"
        height="400"
        src="https://`quicksightdomain`/sn/embed/share/accounts/`111122223333`/dashboards/`DASHBOARDID`/sheets/`SHEETID`>/visuals/`VISUALID`">
    </iframe>
```

## Step 4: Paste the embed code into

an HTML page, wiki page, or portal

Use the following procedure to paste the embed code into an HTML page, wiki
page, or portal.

###### To paste the embed code

- Open the HTML code for the location where you want to embed the visual
  or dashboard, and paste the embed code in.

The following example shows what this might look like for an embedded
dashboard. The `quicksightdomain`
in this example is the URL that you use to access your Amazon Quick Sight
account.

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
    <body>

    <h2>Example.com - Employee Portal</h2>
    <h3>Current shipment stats</h3>
        <iframe
        width="960"
        height="720"
        src="https://`quicksightdomain`/sn/
            embed/share/accounts/`accountid`/dashboards/`dashboardid`">
    </iframe>

    </body>
    </html>
```

The following example shows what this might look like for an embedded
visual. The `quicksightdomain` in
this example is the URL that you use to access your Amazon Quick Sight
account.

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
    <body>

    <h2>Example.com - Employee Portal</h2>
    <h3>Current shipment stats</h3>
        <iframe
        width="600"
        height="400"
        src="https://`quicksightdomain`/sn/embed/share/accounts/`111122223333`/dashboards/`DASHBOARDID`/sheets/`SHEETID`>/visuals/`VISUALID`">
    </iframe>

    </body>
    </html>
```

If your public-facing applications are built on Google Sites, open the page on
Google Sites and then paste the embed code using the embed widget.

Make sure that the following domains in Amazon Quick Sight are on your allow
list when you embed in Google Sites:

- `https://googleusercontent.com` (turns on
  subdomains)
- `https://www.gstatic.com`
- `https://sites.google.com`

After you embed the visual or dashboard in your application, anyone who can
access your application can access the embedded visual or dashboard. To update a
dashboard that's shared with the public, see [Updating a
publicly shared dashboard](share-a-dashboard-grant-access-anyone-update.md "share-a-dashboard-grant-access-anyone-update.md"). To turn off
public sharing, see [Turning off
public sharing settings](share-a-dashboard-grant-access-anyone-no-share.md "share-a-dashboard-grant-access-anyone-no-share.md").

When you turn off public sharing, no one from the internet can access a
dashboard or dashboards that you have embedded on a public application or shared
with a link. The next time anyone tries to view such a dashboard from the
internet, they receive a message that they don't have access to view it.
