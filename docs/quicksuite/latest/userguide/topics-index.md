When you create a topic, Quick Sight creates, stores, and maintains an index with
definitions for data in that topic. This index isn't exposed to Quick Sight
authors. It's not a copy of the datasets included in a topic either. Metrics are not
indexed. For example, measures stored as integers are not indexed.

The topic index is an index of unique string values for fields included in a topic. This index
is used to generate correct answers, provide autocomplete suggestions when
someone asks a question, and suggest mappings of terms to columns or data values.

To refresh a topic index, refresh the datasets in the topic. You can manually refresh
all datasets in a topic or refresh an individual dataset. You can also view dataset
refresh history to monitor past refreshes, and set a recurring refresh schedule for
every dataset in the topic. For SPICE datasets, you can sync the topic
index refresh schedule with the SPICE refresh schedule. For more
information about setting SPICE refresh schedules, see [Refreshing a dataset on a schedule](refreshing-imported-data.md#schedule-data-refresh "refreshing-imported-data.md#schedule-data-refresh") .

###### Note

Currently, hourly refresh schedules aren't supported. You can set a
refresh schedule to refresh datasets in a topic up to once a day.

We recommend that you update topic indexes regularly to ensure that the latest
definitions and values are recorded. Updating a topic index takes approximately 15 to 30
minutes, depending on the number and size of datasets included in the topic.

###### To refresh a topic index

1. On the Quick Suite start page, choose
   **Topics**.
2. On the **Topics** page that opens, open the topic that you
   want to refresh.

The topic opens to the **Summary** tab, which shows the
datasets that are included in the topic at page bottom. It also shows when the
last time the topic was refreshed at upper right. 3. Choose **Refreshed** at upper right to refresh the topic
index, and then choose **Refresh data**. Doing this manually
refreshes all datasets in the topic.

For more information about refreshing individual datasets in a topic, see
[Refreshing datasets in a
Quick Sight topic](topics-data-refresh.md "topics-data-refresh.md").
