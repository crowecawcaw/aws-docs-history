# percentileContOver

The `percentileContOver` function calculates the percentile based on the
actual numbers in `measure`. It uses the grouping and sorting that are
applied in the field wells. The result is partitioned by the specified dimension at the
specified calculation level.

Use this function to answer the following question: Which actual data points are
present in this percentile? To return the nearest percentile value that is present in
your dataset, use `percentileDiscOver`. To return an exact percentile value
that might not be present in your dataset, use `percentileContOver` instead.

## Syntax

```
percentileContOver (
    `measure`
  , `percentile-n`
  , [`partition-by, …`]
  , `calculation-level`
)
```

## Arguments

_measure_

Specifies a numeric value to use to compute the percentile. The
argument must be a measure or metric. Nulls are ignored in the
calculation.

_percentile-n_

The percentile value can be any numeric constant 0–100. A
percentile value of 50 computes the median value of the measure.

_partition-by_

(Optional) One or more dimensions that you want to partition by,
separated by commas. Each field in the list is enclosed in { } (curly
braces), if it is more than one word. The entire list is enclosed in [ ]
(square brackets).

_calculation-level_

Specifies where to perform the calculation in relation to the order
of evaluation. There are three supported calculation levels:

- PRE_FILTER
- PRE_AGG
- POST_AGG_FILTER (default) – To use this calculation
  level, specify an aggregation on `measure`, for
  example `sum(measure)`.

PRE_FILTER and PRE_AGG are applied before the aggregation occurs in a
visualization. For these two calculation levels, you can't specify an
aggregation on `measure` in the calculated field expression.
To learn more about calculation levels and when they apply, see [Order of evaluation in Amazon Quick Suite](../../../quicksight/latest/user/order-of-evaluation-quicksight.md "../../../quicksight/latest/user/order-of-evaluation-quicksight.md") and
[Using level-aware calculations in
Quick Suite](../../../quicksight/latest/user/level-aware-calculations.md "../../../quicksight/latest/user/level-aware-calculations.md").

## Returns

The result of the function is a number.

percentileContOver

The following example helps explain how percentileContOver works.

###### Example Comparing calculation levels for the median

The following example shows the median for a dimension (category) by using
different calculation levels with the `percentileContOver` function.
The percentile is 50. The dataset is filtered by a region field. The code for
each calculated field is as follows:

- `example = left( `category`, 1 )`
  (A simplified example.)
- `pre_agg = percentileContOver ( {Revenue} , 50 , [ example
] , PRE_AGG)`
- `pre_filter = percentileContOver ( {Revenue} , 50 , [
example ] , PRE_FILTER)`
- `post_agg_filter = percentileContOver ( sum ( {Revenue} )
, 50 , [ example ], POST_AGG_FILTER )`

```
