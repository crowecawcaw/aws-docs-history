# Creating cascading filters

The idea behind cascading any action, such as a filter, is that choices in the higher
levels of a hierarchy affect the lower levels of a hierarchy. The term
_cascading_ comes from the way that a cascade waterfall flows
from one tier to the next.

To set up cascading filters, you need a trigger point where the filter is activated,
and target points where the filter is applied. In Quick Suite, the trigger and
target points are included in visuals.

To create a cascading filter, you set up an action, not a filter. This approach is
because you need to define how the cascading filter is activated, which fields are
involved, and which visuals are filtered when someone activates it. For more
information, including step-by-step instructions, see [Using custom actions for filtering and
navigating](quicksight-actions.md "quicksight-actions.md").

There are two other ways to activate a filter across multiple visuals:

- For a filter that is activated from a widget on a
  dashboard – The widget is called a _sheet control,_ which is a custom menu that you can add to the
  top of your analysis or dashboard. The most common sheet control is a drop-down
  list, which displays a list of options to choose from when you open it. To add
  one of these to your analysis, create a parameter, add a control to the
  parameter, and then add a filter that uses the parameter. For more information,
  see [Setting up parameters in Amazon Quick Suite](parameters-set-up.md "parameters-set-up.md"), [Using a control with a parameter in
  Amazon Quick Suite](parameters-controls.md "parameters-controls.md"), and
  [Adding filter controls to analysis sheets](filter-controls.md "filter-controls.md").
- For a filter that always applies to multiple visuals
  – This is a regular filter, except that you set its scope to
  apply to multiple (or all) visuals. This type of filter doesn't really
  cascade, because there is no trigger point. It always filters all the visuals
  that it's configured to filter. To add this type of filter to your
  analysis, create or edit a filter and then choose its scope: **Single
  visual**, **Single sheet**, or **Cross
  sheets**. Note the option to **Apply
  cross-datasets**. If this box is checked, then the filter will be
  applied to all visuals from different datasets that are applicable on all sheets
  in the filter scope. For more information, see [Filters](cross-sheet-filters.md#filters "cross-sheet-filters.md#filters").
