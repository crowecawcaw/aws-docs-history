# Customize date and time values of an

analysis

In Amazon Quick Suite, authors can set custom time zones and week start days of an analysis.
When you set a custom week start or time zone, all visuals in the analysis that use
datetime data are formatted to reflect the time zone or week start that the analysis
uses.

## Setting custom time zones in an analysis

Quick Suite authors can use _custom time zones_ to help
manage data across multiple geographic regions. When you set a custom time zone, all
visible dimensions, measures, calculated fields, and filters are converted to the
chosen time zone at query run time. Daylight Savings Time (DST) adjustments are
applied automatically to eliminate the need for time consuming workarounds that
don't accurately handle historical dates.

_Custom time zones_ refer to the use of IANA time zone
abbreviations that represent specific geographic regions around the world. Each time
zone is defined as an offset from Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). Time zones are
different from simple offsets because they incorporate DST.

The default time zone for all analyses is `UTC`.

The following rules apply to time zones.

- **Datetime displays with a granularity that is lower
  than `hour` are converted to the selected time
  zone.** For example, if you set the timezone of an analysis to
  `America/New_York (UTC-04:00)`, the datetime value
  `Dec.1, 2020 12:00am` in `UTC+00:00` is converted
  and displayed as `Nov.30, 2020 7:00pm`. Daylight Savings Time
  (DST) is incorporated into the datetime conversion.
- **Datetime literals that are added to calculations or
  selected in filters honor the selected time zone of the
  analysis.** For example, if you manually enter a literal into a
  calculated field such as `01-01-2022 7:00pm`, or select a fixed
  filter time, Quick Sight applies the chosen timezone to the literal
  value.
- **Measures that are aggregated above the
  `hour/minute` granularity are aggregated based on the
  timezone that the analyss is set to.** When Quick Sight
  processes a dataset, all timestamps are initially converted at the lowest
  granularity level. Values are then aggregated based on the boundary of the
  selected time zone for the analysis. For example, a sum of hourly revenues
  at the day level with a `UTC+00:00` time zone aggregate all
  hourly revenues from `12am-11pm` for the `UTC` time
  zone. When you convert `UTC+00:00` to `New_York
(UTC-04:00)`, all revenue datapoints are aggregated from
  `8:00pm-7:00pm(+1day)` in `UTC` to correspond with
  the start and end of the day in `New_York (UTC-04:00)`.
- **The `now()` function, rolling date
  filter, and parameters are converted to the chosen time zone.**
  Relative date filters, rolling date filters, and relative date parameters
  that use the `now()` function also honor the chosen time zone
  when they are applied to the visual. For example, when you select a relative
  filter such as `last week` or a rolling date filter such as
  `start of the month`, the chosen timezone is automatically
  applied to the filter to display the values `last week of New_York time
zone` and `start of the month of New_York time zone`,
  respectively.

###### To set the custom time zone of an analysis

1. From the analysis that you want to change, navigate to the top menu and
   choose **Edit**.
2. Choose **Analysis settings**, and then choose
   **Date and time**.
3. Toggle **Convert time zone** ON, and choose the
   **Time zone** that you want.
4. Choose **Apply**.

When an analysis is assigned a time zone, an icon appears at the top of the
analysis that indicates which time zone the analysis uses. This icon also appears on
any dashboard that is published from the analysis.

**Considerations**

The following considerations apply to custom time zones.

- To use custom time zones, all datetime columns in a dataset must be
  normalized to UTC. If your datetime columns aren't normalized in your
  data source, you need to convert the columns in your data source before you
  can use this feature.
- For analyses that are not assigned a custom time zone, author and reader
  experiences are unaffected.
- Once a time zone is added to an analysis, the time zone is applied to all
  visuals and sheets in the analysis.
- Quick Suite authors can choose only one time zone for an analysis.
  All dashboards that are published from the analysis use the time zone that
  the analysis uses. To create a dashboard that uses a different time zone
  than the one that the analysis uses, change the time zone of the analysis
  and republish the dashboard.
- Quick Suite readers can't change the time zone of a
  dashboard.
- If you set the time zone of an analysis that uses a dataset that is stored
  in Direct Query and experience slow load times, consider storing the dataset
  in SPICE. SPICE is engineered to handle time
  zone conversions in a performant way.
- Custom time zones do not support the following database engines:
  - Timestream
  - OpenSearch Service
  - Teradata
  - SqlServer

## Setting custom week start days in an

analysis

Quick Suite authors can define the week start day of an analysis to align
their data with the schedule that their company or industry follows. When you set a
custom week start day, all dimensions, calculated fields, and filters that are
aggregated at the week level are calculated to align with the new week start day.
The default week start day is `Sunday`.

###### To set the custom week start day of an analysis

1. From the analysis that you want to change, navigate to the top menu and
   choose **Edit**.
2. Choose **Analysis settings**, and then choose
   **Date and time**.
3. For **Custom start day**, choose the start day that you
   want.
4. Choose **Apply**.

**Considerations**

The following considerations apply to custom week start days.

- Datetime fields are converted at run time. When you work with calculated
  fields that use datetime values, define the fields at the analysis level
  instead of the dataset level.
- Once you choose a new week start day, the change is applied to all visuals
  and sheets in the analysis.
- Quick Suite authors can choose only one week start day for an
  analysis. All dashboards that are published from the analysis use the week
  start day that the analysis uses. To create a dashboard that uses a
  different week start day than the one that the analysis uses, change the
  week start day of the analysis and republish the dashboard.
- Quick Suite readers can't change the week start day of a
  dashboard.
