# I am not authorized to perform an action in WorkSpaces Secure Browser
<a name="security_iam_troubleshoot-no-permissions"></a>

If you receive an error that you're not authorized to perform an action, your policies must be updated to allow you to perform the action.

The following example error occurs when the `mateojackson` IAM user tries to use the console to view details about a fictional `{{my-example-widget}}` resource but doesn't have the fictional `workspaces-web:{{GetWidget}}` permissions.

```
User: arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/mateojackson is not authorized to perform: workspaces-web:{{GetWidget}} on resource: {{my-example-widget}}
```

In this case, the policy for the `mateojackson` user must be updated to allow access to the `{{my-example-widget}}` resource by using the `workspaces-web:{{GetWidget}}` action.

If you need help, contact your AWS administrator. Your administrator is the person who provided you with your sign-in credentials.
