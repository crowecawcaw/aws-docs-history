# Upgrading to engine version 1.2.0.0 or

above from a version earlier than 1.2.0.0

[Engine release 1.2.0.0](engine-releases-1.2.0.md "engine-releases-1.2.0.md") introduced
several significant changes that can make upgrading from an earlier version more
complicated than usual:

- [Engine release 1.2.0.0](engine-releases-1.2.0.md "engine-releases-1.2.0.md") introduced
  a new format for custom parameter groups and custom cluster parameter
  groups. As a result, if you are upgrading from an engine version earlier than 1.2.0.0
  to engine version 1.2.0.0 or above, you must re-create all your existing custom
  parameter groups and custom cluster parameter groups using parameter group family
  `neptune1.2`. Earlier releases used parameter group family `neptune1`,
  and those parameter groups won't work with release 1.2.0.0 and above.
  See [Amazon Neptune parameter groups](parameter-groups.md "parameter-groups.md") for more
  information.
- Engine release 1.2.0.0 also introduced a new format for undo logs. As a result,
  any undo logs created by an earlier engine version must be purged and the [UndoLogsListSize](cw-metrics.md#cw-metrics-UndoLogListSize "cw-metrics.md#cw-metrics-UndoLogListSize") CloudWatch metric
  must fall to zero before any upgrade from a version earlier than 1.2.0.0 can get
  started. If there are too many undo log records (200,000 or more) when you try
  to start an update, the upgrade attempt may time out while waiting for purging
  of the undo logs to complete.

You can speed up the purge rate by upgrading the cluster's writer instance,
which is where the purging occurs. Doing that before trying to upgrade can bring
down the number of undo logs before you start. Increasing the size of the writer
to a 24XL instance type can increase your purge rate to more than a million
records per hour.

If the `UndoLogsListSize` CloudWatch metric is extremely large, opening
a support case may help you explore additional strategies for bringing it down.

- Finally, there was a breaking change in release 1.2.0.0 affecting earlier code
  that used the Bolt protocol with IAM authentication. Starting with release 1.2.0.0,
  Bolt needs a resource path for IAM signing. In Java, setting the resource path
  might look like this: `request.setResourcePath("/openCypher"));`.
  In other languages, the `/openCypher` can be appended to the endpoint
  URI. See [Using the Bolt protocol](access-graph-opencypher-bolt.md "access-graph-opencypher-bolt.md") for examples.
