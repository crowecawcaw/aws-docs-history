# openCypher specification compliance in Amazon Neptune

The Amazon Neptune release of openCypher generally supports the clauses, operators,
expressions, functions, and syntax defined in the by the current openCypher specification,
which is the [Cypher
Query Language Reference Version 9](https://s3.amazonaws.com/artifacts.opencypher.org/openCypher9.pdf "https://s3.amazonaws.com/artifacts.opencypher.org/openCypher9.pdf"). Limitations and differences in Neptune
support for openCypher are called out below.

Amazon Neptune also supports several features beyond the scope of the openCypher specification. Refer to
[openCypher extensions in Amazon Neptune](access-graph-opencypher-extensions.md "access-graph-opencypher-extensions.md") for details.

###### Note

The current Neo4j implementation of Cypher contains functionality that is
not contained in the openCypher specification mentioned above. If you are migrating
current Cypher code to Neptune, see [Neptune compatibility with Neo4j](migration-compatibility.md "migration-compatibility.md") and [Rewriting Cypher queries to run in openCypher on Neptune](migration-opencypher-rewrites.md "migration-opencypher-rewrites.md") for more information.

## Support for openCypher clauses in Neptune

Neptune supports the following clauses, except as noted:

- `MATCH`   –  
  Supported, except that `shortestPath()` and
  `allShortestPaths()` are not currently supported.
- `OPTIONAL MATCH`
- `MANDATORY MATCH`   –  
  is **not** currently supported in Neptune. Neptune
  does, however, support [custom ID
  values](access-graph-opencypher-extensions.md#opencypher-compliance-custom-ids "access-graph-opencypher-extensions.md#opencypher-compliance-custom-ids") in `MATCH` queries.
- `RETURN`   –  
  Supported, except when used with non-static values for `SKIP`
  or `LIMIT`. For example, the following currently does not work:

```
MATCH (n)
RETURN n LIMIT toInteger(rand())    // Does NOT work!
```

- `WITH`   –  
  Supported, except when used with non-static values for `SKIP`
  or `LIMIT`. For example, the following currently does not work:

```
MATCH (n)
WITH n SKIP toInteger(rand())
WITH count() AS count
RETURN count > 0 AS nonEmpty    // Does NOT work!
```

- `UNWIND`
- `WHERE`
- `ORDER BY`
- `SKIP`
- `LIMIT`
- `CREATE`   –  
  Neptune lets you create [custom ID
  values](access-graph-opencypher-extensions.md#opencypher-compliance-custom-ids "access-graph-opencypher-extensions.md#opencypher-compliance-custom-ids") in `CREATE` queries.
- `DELETE`
- `SET`
- `REMOVE`
- `MERGE`   –  
  Neptune supports [custom ID
  values](access-graph-opencypher-extensions.md#opencypher-compliance-custom-ids "access-graph-opencypher-extensions.md#opencypher-compliance-custom-ids") in `MERGE` queries.
- `CALL[YIELD...]`   –  
  is **not** currently supported in Neptune.
- `UNION, UNION ALL`   –  
  read-only queries are supported, but mutation queries are **not**
  currently supported.
- `USING`   –   `USING` is supported from engine version
  [1.3.2.0](engine-releases-1.3.2.md "engine-releases-1.3.2.md"). See
  [Query hints](opencypher-query-hints.md "opencypher-query-hints.md") for

## Neptune-specific openCypher implementation details

The following sections describe ways in which the Neptune implementation of
openCypher may differ from or go beyond the [openCypher spec](https://s3.amazonaws.com/artifacts.opencypher.org/openCypher9.pdf "https://s3.amazonaws.com/artifacts.opencypher.org/openCypher9.pdf").

### Variable-length path (VLP) evaluations in Neptune

Variable length path (`VLP`) evaluations discover paths between nodes
in the graph. Path length can be unrestricted in a query. To prevent cycles, the
[openCypher spec](https://s3.amazonaws.com/artifacts.opencypher.org/openCypher9.pdf "https://s3.amazonaws.com/artifacts.opencypher.org/openCypher9.pdf") specifies that each edge must be traversed at most once per solution.

For VLPs, the Neptune implementation deviates from the openCypher spec in that
it only supports constant values for property equality filters. Take the following
query:

```
MATCH (x)-[:route*1..2 {dist:33, code:x.name}]->(y) return x,y
```

Because the `x.name` property equality filter value is a not a constant,
this query results in an `UnsupportedOperationException` with the message:
`Property predicate over variable-length relationships with non-constant
 expression is not supported in this release.`

### Temporal support in the Neptune openCypher implementation (Neptune database

1.3.1.0 and below)

Neptune currently provides limited support for temporal function in openCypher.
It supports the `DateTime` data type for temporal types.

The `datetime()` function can be used to get the current UTC date and time
like this:

```
RETURN  datetime() as res
```

Date and time values can be parsed from strings in a
`"`_date_`T`_time_`"` format
where _date_ and _time_ are both expressed in
one of the supported forms below:

###### Supported date formats

- `yyyy-MM-dd`
- `yyyyMMdd`
- `yyyy-MM`
- `yyyy-DDD`
- `yyyyDDD`
- `yyyy`

###### Supported time formats

- `HH:mm:ssZ`
- `HHmmssZ`
- `HH:mm:ssZ`
- `HH:mmZ`
- `HHmmZ`
- `HHZ`
- `HHmmss`
- `HH:mm:ss`
- `HH:mm`
- `HHmm`
- `HH`

For example:

```
RETURN datetime('2022-01-01T00:01')      // or another example:
RETURN datetime('2022T0001')
```

Note that all date/time values in Neptune openCypher are stored
and retrieved as UTC values.

Neptune openCypher uses a `statement` clock, meaning
that the same instant in time is used throughout the duration of a query.
A different query within the same transaction may use a different instant
in time.

Neptune doesn't support use of a function within a call to
`datetime()`. For example, the following won't work:

```
CREATE (:n {date:datetime(tostring(2021))})  // ---> NOT ALLOWED!
```

Neptune does support the `epochmillis()` function
that converts a `datetime` to `epochmillis`.
For example:

```
MATCH (n) RETURN epochMillis(n.someDateTime)
1698972364782
```

Neptune doesn't currently support other functions and operations on
`DateTime` objects, such as addition and subtraction.

### Temporal support in the Neptune openCypher implementation

(Neptune Analytics and Neptune Database 1.3.2.0 and above)

The following datetime functionality for OpenCypher applies to Neptune Analytics. Alternatively, you can use
the labmode parameter `DatetimeMillisecond=enabled` for enabling the following datetime functionality on
Neptune engine release version 1.3.2.0 and above. For more details about using this functionality in labmode, see
[Extended datetime support](features-lab-mode.md#labmode-extended-datetime-support "features-lab-mode.md#labmode-extended-datetime-support").

- Support for milliseconds. Datetime literal will always be returned with milliseconds, even if milliseconds is 0.
  (Previous behavior was to truncate milliseconds.)

```
CREATE (:event {time: datetime('2024-04-01T23:59:59Z')})

# Returning the date returns with 000 suffixed representing milliseconds
MATCH(n:event)
RETURN n.time as datetime

{
  "results" : [ {
    "n" : {
      "~id" : "0fe88f7f-a9d9-470a-bbf2-fd6dd5bf1a7d",
      "~entityType" : "node",
      "~labels" : [ "event" ],
      "~properties" : {
        "time" : "2024-04-01T23:59:59.000Z"
      }
    }
  } ]
}
```

- Support for calling the datetime() function over stored properties or intermediate results. For example, the
  following queries were not possible prior to this feature.

Datetime() over properties:

```
// Create node with property 'time' stored as string
CREATE (:event {time: '2024-04-01T23:59:59Z'})

// Match and return this property as datetime
MATCH(n:event)
RETURN datetime(n.time) as datetime
```

Datetime() over intermediate results:

```
// Parse datetime from parameter
UNWIND $list as myDate
RETURN datetime(myDate) as d
```

- It is now also possible to save datetime perperties that are created the in cases mentioned above.

Saving datetime from the string property of one property to another:

```
// Create node with property 'time' stored as string
CREATE (:event {time: '2024-04-01T23:59:59Z', name: 'crash'})

// Match and update the same property to datetime type
MATCH(n:event {name: 'crash'})
SET n.time = datetime(n.time)

// Match and update another node's property
MATCH(e:event {name: 'crash'})
MATCH(n:server {name: e.servername})
SET n.time = datetime(e.time)
```

Batch create nodes from a parameter with a datetime property:

```
// Batch create from parameter
UNWIND $list as events
CREATE (n:crash) {time: datetime(events.time)}
// Parameter value
{
  "x":[
    {"time":"2024-01-01T23:59:29", "name":"crash1"},
    {"time":"2023-01-01T00:00:00Z", "name":"crash2"}
  ]
}
```

- Support for a larger subset of ISO8601 datetime formats. See below.

Supported formats

The format of a datetime value is [Date]T[Time][Timezone], where T is the separator. If an explicit timezone is not provided,
UTC (Z) is assumed to be the default.

Timezone

Supported timezone formats are:

- +/-HH:mm
- +/-HHmm
- +/-HH

The presence of a timezone in a datetime string is optional. In case the timezone offset is 0, Z can be used instead of
the timezone postfix above to indicate UTC time. The supported range of a timezone is from -14:00 to +14:00.

Date

If no timezone is present, or the timezone is UTC (Z), the supported date formats are as follows:

###### Note

DDD refers to an ordinal date, which represents a day of the year from 001 to 365 (366 in leap years). For example,
2024-002 represents Jan 2, 2024.

- `yyyy-MM-dd`
- `yyyyMMdd`
- `yyyy-MM`
- `yyyyMM`
- `yyyy-DDD`
- `yyyyDDD`
- `yyyy`

If a timezone other than Z is chosen, the supported date formats are limited to the following:

- `yyyy-MM-dd`
- `yyyy-DDD`
- `yyyyDDD`

The supported range for dates is from 1400-01-01 to 9999-12-31.

Time

If no timezaone is present, or the timezone is UTC (Z), the supported time formats are:

- `HH:mm:ss.SSS`
- `HH:mm:ss`
- `HHmmss.SSS`
- `HHmmss`
- `HH:mm`
- `HHmm`
- `HH`

If a timezone other than Z is chosen, the supported time formats are limited to the following:

- `HH:mm:ss`
- `HH:mm:ss.SSS`

### Differences in Neptune openCypher language semantics

Neptune represents node and relationship IDs as strings rather than
integers. The ID equals the ID supplied via the data loader. If there is a namespace
for the column, the namespace plus the ID. Consequently, the `id` function
returns a string instead of an integer.

The `INTEGER` datatype is limited to 64 bits. When converting larger
floating point or string values to an integer using the `TOINTEGER` function,
negative values are truncated to `LLONG_MIN` and positive values are
truncated to `LLONG_MAX`.

For example:

```
RETURN TOINTEGER(2^100)
>  9223372036854775807

RETURN TOINTEGER(-1 * 2^100)
>  -9223372036854775808
```

### Multi-valued properties

Although openCypher CREATE does not create multi-valued properties, they can exist in data created using Gremlin
(Neptune Database) or when loading data (Neptune Database and Neptune Analytics). If Neptune openCypher
encounters a multi-value property, one of the values is arbitrarily chosen, creating a non-deterministic result.

### Handling of NaN valuse

Neptune’s handling of the comparison of `NaN` property values is undefined. Relying on such
comparisons may result in unexpected or non-deterministic results.
