# Troubleshooting AWS Account Management identity and access

Use the following information to help you diagnose and fix common issues that you might
encounter when working with Account Management and IAM.

## I am not authorized to perform an action in the Account page

If the AWS Management Console tells you that you're not authorized to perform an action, then
you must contact your administrator for assistance. Your administrator is the person
that provided you with your user name and password.

The following example error occurs when the `mateojackson` IAM user
tries to use the console to view details about his AWS account in the
**Account** page of the AWS Management Console but doesn't have the
`account:GetAccountInformation` permissions.

![Error message states "You don't have permission to access billing information for this account." You don't have permission to access billing information for this account. Contact your AWS administrator if you need help. If you are an AWS administrator, you can provide permissions for your users or groups by making sure that (1) this account allows IAM and federated users to access billing information and (2) you have the required IAM permissions](images/AccessError.png)

In this case, Mateo asks his administrator to update his policies to allow him to
access the `my-example-widget` resource using
the `account:`GetWidget`` action.

## I am not authorized to perform `iam:PassRole`

If you receive an error that you're not authorized to perform the `iam:PassRole` action, your policies must be updated to allow you to pass a role to Account Management.

Some AWS services allow you to pass an existing role to that service instead of creating a new service role or service-linked role. To do
this, you must have permissions to pass the role to the service.

The following example error occurs when an IAM user named `marymajor` tries to use the console to perform an action in
Account Management. However, the action requires the service to have permissions that are granted by a service role. Mary does not have permissions to pass the
role to the service.

```
User: arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/`marymajor` is not authorized to perform: iam:PassRole
```

In this case, Mary's policies must be updated to allow her to perform the `iam:PassRole` action.

If you need help, contact your AWS administrator. Your administrator is the person who provided you with your sign-in credentials.

## I want to allow people outside of my AWS account to access my account details

You can create a role that users in other accounts or people outside of your organization can use to access your resources. You can specify who
is trusted to assume the role. For services that support resource-based policies or access control lists (ACLs), you can use those policies to grant
people access to your resources.
